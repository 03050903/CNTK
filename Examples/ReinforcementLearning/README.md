# CNTK Examples: Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

|Data:     |Dynamic Atari Learning Environment (ALE)
|:---------|:---
|Purpose   |This folder contains examples that demonstrate how to use CNTK to define Deep Q Neural Network (Mnih & al, 2013), a value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning method inspired by Q-Learning method 
|Network   |DeepQNeuralNetwork (DQN).
|Training  |Adam.
|Comments  |See below.

## Running the example
## Details

This example uses OpenAI Atari Learning Environment to train an agent on various Atari games using reinforcement learning.


## Notes

This example is only available on Linux as OpenAI ALE doesn't provide Windows interface.
