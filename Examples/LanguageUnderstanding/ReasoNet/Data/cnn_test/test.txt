4th @placeholder @entity33 rules clicking " like " on @entity3 is protected as free speech	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 court of appeals gave @entity3 a thumbs up on wednesday when it ruled that " likes " on the social network are protected as free speech under the @entity6 . in 2009 , six employees at the @entity10 in @entity11 lost their jobs after expressing support for their boss ' opponent in an upcoming election for sheriff , some by liking and commenting on the opponent 's facebook page . @entity2 circuit judge @entity23 found that " liking " something on the social network was the " internet equivalent of displaying a political sign in one 's front yard , " an act the @entity22 has already ruled as protected speech . the decision from the 4th @entity2 @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity11 , was a reversal of an earlier ruling on the case , in which district judge @entity38 said liking a @entity3 page was " insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection . " other courts have ruled that posts on the social network are protected as free speech , but @entity38 differentiated between making full statements and just clicking a button to like something . two of the employees , deputy @entity48 and @entity50 , claimed they were fired by @entity51 specifically for liking a @entity3 profile for @entity51 ' opponent , @entity53 . the two also posted messages showing their support on @entity57 's facebook page . eventually , @entity50 said he removed his post on @entity3 after co-workers asked him why he 'd risked his job so close to retirement . @entity51 allegedly confronted @entity48 and said , " you made your bed , and now you 're going to lie in it -- after the election , you 're gone . " when @entity51 won his bid for re-election , he did not reinstate a number of employees , including @entity48 . @entity3 and the @entity70 became involved with the case , both filing friend of the court briefs .

and @placeholder blocked a scientist from getting a patent	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- if you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books , you wo n't believe what they can do off the page . for starters , @entity8 brought down the @entity10 , and @entity11 raised ships from the ocean floor . 1 . superman defeats the @entity10 in the 1940s , " @entity17 " was a radio sensation . kids across the country huddled around their sets as the @entity21 leapt off the page and over the airwaves . although @entity8 had been fighting crime in print since 1938 , the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further . it was on the radio that @entity8 first faced kryptonite , met @entity32 reporter @entity31 , and became associated with " truth , justice , and the @entity36 way . " so , it 's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named @entity41 decided to expose the secrets of the @entity10 , he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration . in the @entity46 era , the @entity10 experienced a huge resurgence . its membership was skyrocketing , and its political influence was increasing , so @entity41 went undercover to infiltrate the group . by regularly attending meetings , he became privy to the organization 's secrets . but when he took the information to local authorities , they had little interest in using it . the @entity10 had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them . struggling to make use of his findings , @entity41 approached the writers of the @entity8 radio serial . it was perfect timing . with the war over and the @entity70 no longer a threat , the producers were looking for a new villain for @entity8 to fight . the @entity10 was a great fit for the role . in a 16 - episode series titled " @entity76 , " the writers pitted the @entity21 against the men in white hoods . as the storyline progressed , the shows exposed many of the @entity10 's most guarded secrets . by revealing everything from code words to rituals , the program completely stripped the @entity10 of its mystique . within two weeks of the broadcast , @entity10 recruitment was down . and by 1948 , people were showing up to klan rallies just to mock them . @entity0 : 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship 2 . @entity11 's scientific breakthrough in 1966 , @entity97 engineer @entity96 developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls . however , when @entity96 tried to license his invention with the @entity105 patent office , he was denied . @entity11 had beaten him to the punch by 22 years . indeed , @entity108 's concept could be traced back to a @entity11 comic conceived by @entity110 . in addition to being the most celebrated artist of the @entity11 comics , @entity110 was known for his scientific prowess . so in a 1944 story , when @entity11 got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius , the duck managed to mumble , " if i mix @entity120 [ a methylene compound ] with @entity122 [ ammonium ] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog , i should get speckled nitrogen ! " although it sounded like nonsense , it was n't . in 1963 , chemists @entity130 and @entity132 wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the @entity11 story . the final paragraph read , " among experiments which have not , to our knowledge , been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago . " a footnote revealed that " literature " as the @entity11 comic . it seems the web - footed children 's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist . @entity0 : musicians performing on @entity152 but why were these top @entity36 chemists looking to comics for inspiration ? apparently , dr. @entity130 had been a lifelong @entity11 fan , and he 'd rediscovered @entity11 's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures . @entity130 never disclosed how much his work owed to @entity162 's most famous resident , but then again , how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research ? 3 . a @entity166 villain keeps folks out of jail in a 1977 edition of @entity166 , @entity169 has the tables turned on him . the villain , @entity172 , tracks down @entity169 using an electronic transmitter that he 'd fastened to the superhero 's wrist . although @entity172 loses in the end ( he always does ) , one @entity177 judge saw beauty in his plan . inspired by the strip , judge @entity181 turned to computer salesman @entity183 and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial . in 1983 , @entity183 produced his first batch of electronic monitors . authorities in @entity191 then tested the devices on five offenders , using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration . today , the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country , usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets . most famously , @entity203 donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004 . perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed @entity166 , too . @entity0 : truth about lie detectors ( and @entity208 ) 4 . @entity209 saves the bad - hair day like most @entity36 kids in the 1940s , @entity211 fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes . but it turns out that @entity216 might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers . during his early teen years , @entity211 was obsessed with @entity209 , known as " @entity36 's most famous boy hero . " a younger version of @entity224 , the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead . sound familiar ? when @entity211 set out to conquer @entity36 with his rock ' n ' roll ways , he copied the ' do , thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century . but that was n't all . @entity224 also gets credit for the short capes @entity211 wore on the back of his jumpsuits , as well as @entity216 's famous @entity243 logo , which bears a striking resemblance to @entity224 's lightning bolt insignia . of course , @entity211 never tried to hide his love for the captain . a copy of @entity209 no. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in @entity251 , and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at @entity254 . plus , the admiration was mutual . @entity209 paid tribute to @entity216 in one issue , referring to the singer as " the greatest modern - day philosopher .

@placeholder fishermen lift port blockades at @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity12	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 fishermen suspended their blockade at three @entity6 ports thursday , allowing ferry traffic and freight to move through after two days of disruption , union leaders said . @entity3 fishing boats blockade the port of @entity12 . the @entity3 ports of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity12 were open again after @entity3 unions met thursday and agreed to stop the blockade . union leaders have yet to agree on how the rest of their protest will develop , and whether the suspension will become permanent . the fishermen began their blockade of the three ports tuesday to protest @entity26 fishing quotas , which they say threaten their livelihoods . the flotillas forced a halt to all @entity31 traffic , including passenger ferries and freighters , stranding tourists on both sides of the waterway and causing a backlog of freight trucks . @entity39 , the largest ferry operator on the @entity6 , said it had resumed running normal services to @entity14 . " it is our hope that we 'll be able to continue doing that throughout the day , " spokeswoman @entity42 said . @entity47 , which operates services to @entity12 , said it had canceled four sailings thursday as a result of the dispute . " we do not yet have any information on whether any of our services will be affected beyond 16th april , " the company said in a statement . @entity3 fishermen held four hours of talks with @entity58 and fisheries minister @entity59 in @entity60 on wednesday , the @entity3 news agency @entity56 reported . @entity59 offered the local industry ‚Ç¨ 4 million ( $ 5.3 million ) in aid , but refused to budge on the fishermen 's key demand that the @entity26 increase fishing quotas , @entity56 reported . both @entity3 and the @entity26 have ruled out any renegotiation , pointing out that @entity3 cod quotas have already been raised 30 percent since 2008 , @entity56 said .	@entity3:French	@entity31:cross-Channel	@entity15:Dunkirk	@entity14:Calais	@entity26:European Union	@entity6:Channel	@entity39:P&O	@entity0:CNN	@entity56:AFP	@entity42:Michelle Ulyatt	@entity47:LD Ferries	@entity12:Boulogne	@entity59:Barnier	@entity58:Agriculture	@entity60:Paris	@entity78:Dover-Calais
@placeholder strategist says all the racism controversy is " absurd "	@entity190	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- race and politics are a combustible combo that explodes into headlines when an ex-president lights the fuse , as @entity8 did recently . president @entity9 during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics . " when a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the @entity22 as an animal or as a reincarnation of @entity25 or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried @entity9 with @entity29 , those kinds of things are beyond the bounds , " the @entity13 told students at @entity15 on wednesday . " i think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against @entity9 have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be @entity38 , " he added . the controversy erupted this week when @entity8 first raised the race issue to @entity41 . " an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward president @entity9 is based on the fact that he is a black man , " he said . @entity46 , a black comedian and actor , said wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with @entity8 . " during president @entity9 's speech on the status of health care reform , some members of @entity50 engaged in a public display of disrespect , " he said . @entity1 contributor @entity56 said that some of the allegations of race - baiting might have some weight among @entity63 voters . " @entity8 , i 'm afraid , is not alone in his views , " he said . but @entity56 warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to @entity9 's ideology . " but i think it 's wrongheaded , and i think it 's unfair , and i think it 's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents , most of the opponents of health care reform , to say that they 're racist , " he said . " seven previous presidents have tried to bring health care reforms of this kind . all seven have failed . and , as i recall , all seven were white . " @entity8 's comments , though , are the kind that raise people 's defenses . in particular , they turn off independents , who by nature tend to hate the hard edges of politics . the @entity95 , for its part , wants no part of the @entity8 controversy . " the president does not believe that that criticism comes based on the color of his skin , " said @entity95 press secretary @entity98 . as a candidate , @entity9 understood the political danger in letting his race become a major topic . he largely avoided it when he could , but race was always a subtext , as it is now in his presidency . " but i can also say , frankly , that this @entity95 and even his campaign were very afraid to even go down this road dealing with anything with race , " said @entity1 contributor @entity111 . @entity8 also told @entity41 that there is an " inherent feeling among many people in this country that an @entity38 ought not to be president and ought not to be given the same respect as if he were white . " framing criticism as racism cropped up several times during the campaign . when @entity128 , a @entity129 supporter , said during the 2008 @entity63 primaries that @entity9 would never have gotten as far as he had if he had not been black , candidate @entity9 pointedly left race out of it . " i think that her comments were ridiculous , " @entity9 said at the time . but @entity128 blamed @entity9 supporters for her hate mail , saying " i have been called all kinds of names . and the attacks are ageist . they 're sexist . they 're racist . " ireport.com : freedom from speech ? and the topic of race even came to haunt @entity129 , the so - called first black president . before the @entity146 primary in january 2008 , @entity129 told an audience that " there 's no difference in [ @entity9 's ] voting record and @entity151 's ever since . give me a break . this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale i have ever seen . " some interpreted that as belittling @entity9 's campaign . after much criticism , @entity129 later said he was talking about @entity9 's opposition to the war in @entity161 , not his campaign . but those two words -- " fairy tale " -- launched weeks worth of accusations , sometimes on the front page of the @entity167 , that the @entity168 were playing the race card . ireport.com : share your thoughts on race and politics some observers said @entity8 's statement was far too broad , and that many of the attacks on @entity9 are about policy , not race . " i do n't think one can paint a broad brush in saying that all of these folks who have criticism , anybody who criticizes the president ... is based upon the issue of race , " @entity111 said . @entity188 , a @entity1 contributor and @entity190 strategist , said @entity8 's criticism is " absurd . " " it 's very dangerous politics , " she said . " @entity9 got , in the last election , more white male voters than any of his predecessors . ... republicans and conservatives and @entity63 and liberals , the whole country felt very good putting -- setting aside policies after his election .

" @entity1 in good spirits in 18th hour the attempt to swim from @entity6 to @entity7 is the second for the swimmer , who said at a news conference sunday that she is fitter today than she was in 1978 , when she first attempted the crossing but was unable to finish . " when i walk up on those shores of @entity7 , i want to prove to the @entity39 crowd that it 's not too late to go back and write that book or adopt that child , " she said . she jumped into the water at 7:45 p.m. et on sunday and expects to swim for roughly 60 hours . she is stopping briefly each hour to eat . " nobody decides the swim is over except me , " @entity1 's team quoted her on @entity45 as saying . wind , water , one woman 's drive it took several months to gain permission for the swim from @entity6 and @entity56 authorities . bureaucratic snags repeatedly threatened to call off the effort -- already called off in 2010 because of weather . @entity1 has been training for the event for two years , swimming up to 12 hours a day . " i 'm almost 62 years old and i 'm standing here at the prime of my life , " she said sunday as she prepared to dive into the water at @entity64 's @entity63 .

@placeholder sets the pace in practice ahead of the @entity4 @entity97	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- it took him a while to get going in @entity4 but once he did , @entity5 proved just why he 's the favorite to win the 2014 formula one world championship . the @entity8 led a one - two for @entity9 on the first day of the new season , underlining the @entity13 marque 's billing as the team who have adjusted best to the sport 's new mechanical regulations . @entity18 heads into the year 's first race in @entity20 off the back of a productive preseason , but the early signs were less than promising . the 2008 drivers ' champion failed to complete a lap during the first session of practice at @entity29 , but he recovered in the afternoon to lead the timesheets ahead of his teammate @entity31 . @entity33 's @entity32 was third fastest . " while it was disappointing to not get any track time this morning , these little hiccups are going to happen with the new cars and we 'll have to get used to that , " @entity5 , who 's car had an oil sensor problem early on friday , told the sport 's official website after a lap of one minute and 29.625 seconds . " it felt like i was on the back foot from there but then we got up to pace quite quickly in @entity48 and found the balance relatively fast . " i feel quite comfortable in the car so overall it 's a positive start but we need to look at the data now and understand where we are . " we got a nice foundation for the weekend in the second session today so hopefully we can build on that in @entity58 tomorrow afternoon and then see where we are in qualifying . " reigning world champion @entity60 was beset by problems during testing , with the all - conquering @entity64 team struggling to get the best out of its @entity67 engine . but despite many fearing the worst for the four - time title winner , @entity60 was fourth fastest -- over half of a second adrift of @entity5 . " in a way it 's a relief today , the fact that we were running , we did n't have any problems , the balance was good and the performance looked alright , " said the @entity13 . " in the end friday times are not worth a lot , but it 's better to be close to the top rather than somewhere towards the back , so i 'm very happy with that . we will do what we can to prepare for tomorrow and sunday , but let 's see where we are then -- the most important thing is that we finish . " @entity60 and co. will be back on the track for qualifying on saturday , with the first race of the 2014 season taking place on sunday . interactive : 10 cars that changed @entity93	@entity31:Nico Rosberg	@entity20:Melbourne	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:German	@entity5:Hamilton	@entity4:Australian	@entity48:P2	@entity9:Mercedes	@entity8:Briton	@entity33:Ferrari	@entity29:Albert Park	@entity18:Hamiltion	@entity32:Fernando Alonso	@entity97:Grand Prix	@entity67:Renault	@entity64:Red Bull	@entity58:P3	@entity93:Formula One	@entity60:Vettel

@placeholder continues her string of flops with " @entity46 "	@entity47	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 weekend appears to have scared off the major movie studios : none of them released a new film , perhaps figuring folks were more interested in parties and trick - or - treating . it seems they were right , as the holiday turned cineplexes into ghost towns . " @entity16 , " a dark thriller starring @entity18 , was the only new movie to open in the top 10 , taking in $ 10.9 million . @entity18 plays a creepy freelance cameraman determined to ride the local tv news trend of " if it bleeds , it leads " to success . weekend estimates showed " @entity16 , " from @entity24 , barely edging last weekend 's champ , the horror flick " @entity27 , " whichever film winds up on top , it 'll be the lowest - grossing no. 1 movie since " @entity32 " topped the chart with just $ 10.4 million in early september in its sixth weekend in release . if " @entity16 " squeezes out the win , it 'll be the lowest - grossing no. 1 debut in more than two years , when " @entity38 " opened with just $ 9.3 million . both of those low - grossing number ones occurred on the weekend after @entity41 , traditionally one of the poorest box office weekends of the year . this weekend 's other new wide release , " @entity46 , " opened outside the top 10 , as expected . @entity47 stars as a woman who wakes up every morning with her memory erased . that 's an eerie similarity to @entity47 's career of late , continuing a pattern of quickly - forgotten films : " trespass , " " @entity55 " " @entity56 , " and " @entity57 . " even a special @entity1 re-release of the original " @entity59 , " the 2004 movie that helped spark the current horror - as - torture - porn genre , could n't lure many fans . @entity64 and his victims averaged a pathetic $ 315 per theater . strange -- it 's as if people looking for scary stuff had something else to do this weekend .	@entity16:Nightcrawler	@entity1:Halloween	@entity0:CNN	@entity27:Ouija	@entity24:Open Road Films	@entity38:The Possession	@entity18:Jake Gyllenhaal	@entity46:Before I Go To Sleep	@entity32:Guardians of the Galaxy	@entity57:The Railway Man	@entity41:Labor Day	@entity55:The Paperboy	@entity47:Nicole Kidman	@entity59:Saw	@entity64:Jigsaw	@entity56:Stoker
@entity41 looks into handwritten note threatening trees and shrubs in @placeholder ' grove	@entity3	authorities are investigating an anonymous threat against the @entity3 's signature greenery ahead of the school 's big football game saturday against bitter rival @entity6 . a note received tuesday on the @entity8 , @entity9 , campus of @entity3 said , " what 's going to happen to ya 'll on the field saturday aint nothing compared to what 's going to happen on your beautiful campus . you wo n't be one of the most pretty campus 's next year . a lot of shrubs and trees are going to die ; especially in the grove . ca n't stop us .

" fans are being encouraged to report any suspicious behavior , " said @entity53 , director of public relations at the @entity3 . " we are looking forward to having another hospitable , enjoyable experience to celebrate the final home game of the season .

well - wishers sign oversized card for @placeholder , who turns 6 wednesday	@entity10	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- as far as birthday milestones go , 6 is n't an age that gets the kind of enthusiastic treatment that parents reserve for when a child turns 1 or comes of age at 12 . but @entity10 turned 6 on wednesday after surviving an unimaginable ordeal , and @entity0 , @entity1 , wanted to make sure it was a birthday worth remembering . and he likely will remember it for a long time , according to sheriff @entity14 , who visited with the boy and his mother . " he 's been with his family . he played with some toys , " @entity18 said wednesday afternoon . " he had a large time . " @entity10 also saw the overwhelming support from his tiny community and from the world . the city had planned a vigil at @entity26 on tuesday night , but after @entity10 was rescued it turned into a celebration . there , children signed an oversized card . " happy 6th @entity10 , " it said . more than 1,200 other cards came in from across the nation , said @entity34 , principal of @entity35 . inside the bunker : from storm shelter to boy 's prison the community started an online campaign to raise $ 7,000 to send the boy and his family to @entity44 . " it grew wings overnight , " said @entity45 , one of the organizers . @entity49 said more than $ 8,200 was raised by wednesday afternoon . " it makes me proud . people just totally want to help . from @entity54 to @entity55 , it 's been overwhelming , " she said . the city is planning a massive birthday party and is trying to find a place large enough to hold it . while the party was n't ready wednesday , many are leaning toward a high school football stadium . such is the joy in this small town of 2,300 knowing that @entity10 wo n't have to waste his birthday wish hoping to be freed from a dark , underground chamber . he was freed monday after being hostage underground for six days . seeing her son again , said @entity10 's mother , was " the most beautiful sight .

" this has been a terrible tragedy for this community and i 'd hate to see this happen again . no one should see this place , " he said . support crucial for kids after trauma the reunion @entity10 was reunited with his mother , who has not been publicly named , at a hospital tuesday . the grateful mother released a statement describing the reunion .

move would put @entity1 in seat once filled by her uncle @placeholder	@entity20	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , who spent most of her life looking to steer clear of the spotlight , is capping off a year of unusually public -- and political -- activity with interest in the @entity7 seat that would be vacated by secretary of state - designate @entity8 . @entity1 could join her uncle @entity10 in the @entity7 . and her interest in that seat could mean the continuation of a @entity1 legacy in the @entity7 that began 56 years ago with the election of her father , @entity16 , as the junior senator from @entity18 . her uncle @entity10 has represented @entity18 in the @entity7 for more than four decades . her uncle @entity20 served as junior senator from @entity22 from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968 . " remember , [ @entity25 's ] seat in the @entity7 was once held by @entity26 , " @entity0 senior political analyst @entity23 said saturday . " her other uncle , @entity27 , is ill right now . if [ @entity22 gov. @entity29 appoints @entity1 to the @entity7 , it means there could be a @entity1 staying in the @entity7 for quite a long time . " @entity29 confirmed to @entity0 saturday that @entity1 called and " asked a few questions " but did not express interest in the seat . " i am sure if she 's interested , she 'll call back , but i 'm not going to rate any of the candidates or talk about prospective candidates . it just adds speculation to the speculation , " @entity29 said . but one @entity41 source close to the @entity1 family said @entity1 " is interested to say the least " about discussing the @entity7 vacancy . the source said @entity1 has asked a tight circle of family friends and political advisers for advice . a second source , who has knowledge of @entity1 's conversation with @entity29 , tells @entity0 that @entity1 reached out to inquire about the responsibilities and impact such a move would have if she were selected by the governor to fill the position . a @entity7 appointment for @entity1 would mark a change for the woman who has rarely run into the glare of political attention . " apparently , she has acquired a taste for politics , having endorsed @entity64 early this year , " @entity23 said . " she wants to be part of this new regime in @entity67 , clearly playing a key role in the @entity7 if she gets that appointment . " watch @entity0 's @entity23 discuss @entity1 's prospects ¬ª widely described as extraordinarily shy , self - deprecating and down - to - earth , @entity1 has tended to limit her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity , penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father 's legacy . but in january , she backed a political candidate for the first time , announcing her endorsement of @entity64 during the @entity41 primary season with an opinion piece in the @entity84 that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding . " i have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them , " she wrote . " but for the first time , i believe i have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me , but for a new generation of @entity67 . " @entity1 willingly lingered in the spotlight , serving on @entity64 's vice presidential search team , speaking at the @entity96 and stumping for him through the primary and general election seasons . in a campaign ad that featured video images of her father followed by images of @entity64 , @entity1 said , " people always tell me how my father inspired them . i feel that same excitement now . " there are a slew of high - profile candidates for @entity25 's @entity7 seat -- including attorney general @entity109 , whose last name carries some star power of its own in the @entity113 -- but their odds grew just a bit steeper when stacked against the wattage of a storied @entity41 dynasty . @entity26 was elected to the @entity7 with few ties to his adopted home state , but his niece 's @entity22 roots run deep . @entity123 relocated to @entity124 after her husband 's assassination in 1963 , with children @entity1 and @entity128 @entity1 has spent most of her life in the city , working there after graduating from @entity131 , meeting her husband , @entity132 , on the job at the @entity134 and attending @entity135 there . her most prominent public roles to date involved overseeing her father 's presidential library and presenting the annual @entity140 . she 's also edited several books , from a volume of children 's poetry and an updated edition of her father 's book " @entity140 " to a collection of patriotic verse ( " a @entity150 's @entity149 , stories , and speeches celebrating the land we love . " ) most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts : hosting the annual nationally televised @entity158 in @entity159 and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the @entity161 , as her mother had . still , in late spring and early summer , she was whispered as a possible vice presidential candidate -- and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an @entity64 @entity166 -- but elected office would mark a major shift for @entity1 . her history of avoiding partisan efforts , her limited policy track record and the lingering legacy of her father 's presidency translated into a far less brutal @entity176 criticism than that experienced by the other members of @entity64 's vice presidential search committee , and there was a widespread continuing sense that she would not want to put herself in line for the tough criticism aimed at elected officials . " i do n't think she 'd go that far , " @entity1 @entity186 speechwriter @entity185 told @entity187 this summer after being asked whether he thought @entity1 wanted to hold office herself . in his memoir , " counselor , " he quoted @entity123 saying her daughter had " gotten her horror of the press from me " and said the younger @entity1 used to hide her face when she spotted a cameraman . but in a 2002 @entity199 interview promoting the updated " @entity140 , " @entity1 would not rule out the possibility of a run for public office . " i do n't have any plans to do that right now , " she said . " i do n't plan ahead . my kids are young , and i 'm really happy to be able to be around . but i do care about issues , and i 'm interested in them . so i do n't see that now , but you know , i have a long life ahead of me . " the 51 - year - old mother of three has still not spoken publicly about her interest in the job -- or whether , after months of campaign - trail conditioning , she might be comfortable with the idea of seeking election in her own right when @entity25 's term ends . @entity0 's @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this story .	@entity22:New York	@entity23:Bill Schneider	@entity20:Robert	@entity26:Robert Kennedy	@entity27:Ted Kennedy	@entity25:Clinton	@entity29:Paterson	@entity149:Handbook : Songs , Poems	@entity159:Washington	@entity158:Kennedy Center Honors	@entity113:Empire State	@entity109:Andrew Cuomo	@entity135:Columbia Law School	@entity134:Metropolitan Museum of Art	@entity150:Patriot	@entity131:Harvard	@entity132:Edwin Schlossberg	@entity140:Profiles in Courage	@entity1:Kennedy	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Senate	@entity199:Time magazine	@entity176:Republican	@entity8:Hillary Clinton	@entity219:Rebecca Sinderbrand	@entity16:John F.

our love - hate relationship with @entity2 but no one expects all these issues to be sorted out in such a meeting . perhaps most importantly , @entity10 and @entity1 should try to get to know each other on a personal level . since no one knows what @entity1 really has in mind for @entity2 and its future , a productive meeting is one in which the two can start building trust and a good working relationship . to gain some insight on @entity1 , it 's useful to look at his past . born into privilege , @entity1 nevertheless spent several years in one of the poorer villages in @entity2 when his father , a top government official , was purged and then jailed during the @entity78 . after his father was rehabilitated , @entity1 quickly climbed the political ladder in the @entity81 . life 's extremes have not made @entity1 noticeably radical or timid but apparently more prudent and reticent . he has had career shortcuts but worked hard to stuff his @entity85 ¬© in order to play the game of a semiobjective meritocracy , as have many ambitious @entity2 of his age . his bona fide membership in @entity2 's " @entity91 " makes him a princeling , which bestows on him the deep trust of the ruling elders in the @entity81 . in a nonhereditary autocracy , such a trust is paramount . to those in power who desire to preserve the current political system and dread a possible @entity2 @entity100 , the 58 - year - old @entity1 is considered a natural successor to president @entity102 when @entity102 's second term ends this fall . indeed , several hundred senior officials secretly endorsed @entity1 as their top choice back in 2007 . consequently , unlike his two predecessors -- who were handpicked by one man , the @entity107 -- @entity1 is poised to bring more legitimacy and confidence to his office . his peaceful and orderly transition to the presidency this fall will signal a new page in the history of his country . @entity1 will be facing a fast - changing world and a faster - changing @entity2 . after 30 years of breathtaking development , today 's @entity2 is greatly diversified and decentralized . relying on authoritarian state control for order is becoming more difficult and costly , as social tensions and economic inequality increase . @entity1 will preside over the world 's second - largest economy at a time when the overheated @entity2 economy is long overdue for a correction or hard landing , which could happen as early as 2013 . while @entity2 is secure and prosperous , its government still struggles with a perpetual mentality of being under siege . defending the status quo will be a great challenge . many incongruities make @entity1 intriguing . he has openly reiterated complaints about the @entity15 and its allies , yet like so many of @entity2 's rich and powerful , he sends his only daughter to study at @entity139 . smart and low - key , @entity1 rarely steps out of the party line , and yet he spoke his mind in @entity144 not long ago to bash foreigners who are " pointing their fingers " at @entity6 's human right record , saying they are bored and have nothing better to do . the world will be watching @entity1 closely to see how he will govern @entity2 and navigate @entity15 - @entity2 relations . over a quarter century ago , @entity1 visited @entity15 as a young cadre managing agriculture for an obscure county . this time , as the next leader of a great country , he may remember fondly how ordinary @entity15 received @entity2 visitors with open arms back then and how much the two countries have gone through together ever since . let 's hope that he will open up to @entity15 on what he envisions as a mutually beneficial partnership between the two countries in the coming years . follow @entity162 on @entity163 . join the conversation on @entity165 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .	@entity81:Communist Party	@entity139:Harvard	@entity85:r√É ¬© sum√É	@entity171:Fei-Ling Wang	@entity2:China	@entity1:Xi	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Beijing	@entity4:Washington	@entity51:World Trade Organization	@entity78:Cultural Revolution	@entity162:CNN Opinion	@entity15:U.S.	@entity35:Syria	@entity34:U.N.

@entity9 spokesman says @placeholder will stick with the market 's current rating system	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- in an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores , @entity5 , the international wireless industry association , yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt. @entity9 and @entity10 basically told the @entity5 to stuff it -- they 're sticking with their own rating schemes . " we 've put a lot of effort into @entity18 's rating system , which now works well globally , " @entity9 spokesman @entity12 said in a statement . " while we support other systems , we think it 's best for @entity18 users and developers to stick with @entity18 's existing ratings . " @entity10 , too , has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail , but has not publicly commented on the @entity5 app rating issue . in the @entity18 , @entity9 assigns content ratings that range from " everyone " to " @entity29 " to " @entity33 , " but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings . however , outlines for the ratings are provided in @entity9 's android market support forum . in its @entity37 , @entity10 provides an age rating ranging from 4 + to 17 + , and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating . for instance @entity41 received a 9 + rating for @entity44 and @entity45 or @entity46 . the @entity5 's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five - point scale based on their violence and sexual content . the ratings , which would be controlled by the @entity55 ( which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings ) would range from " everyone " to " adults only . " @entity10 's @entity37 alone has more than half a million apps and @entity18 is getting close to that number with at least 300,000 . @entity5 announced it would be developing its app rating system in march . the initiative would call for " voluntary self - certification of apps . " the system would make it easier for parents to see -- regardless of mobile platform -- if an app was appropriate for their child . the mobile application rating system was officially announced on tuesday . @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 are the founding bodies of the age - appropriateness rating system . it works like this : app developers answer an online questionnaire about their app 's content , including whether it shares location information , has a social networking component , and if it contains violence or sexual content , among other things . apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously , and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating , it could appeal it . the @entity55 would regularly test popular applications and monitor complaints . subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity103 .	@entity33:High Maturity	@entity0:WIRED magazine	@entity12:Christopher Katsaros	@entity5:CTIA	@entity10:Apple	@entity9:Google	@entity29:Low Maturity	@entity18:Android	@entity44:Infrequent / Mild Horror / Fear Themes	@entity45:Infrequent / Mild Cartoon	@entity46:Fantasy Violence	@entity103:Wired.com	@entity41:Plants vs Zombies	@entity55:ESRB	@entity75:Verizon Wireless	@entity74:Sprint	@entity37:App Store	@entity76:T-Mobile USA	@entity77:U.S. Cellular	@entity73:AT&T	@entity78:Microsoft
rep. @placeholder is introducing legislation to revoke the passports of @entity3 who join terror organizations	@entity133	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) @entity3 officials and lawmakers reeling from the tragic terrorist attack in @entity6 that killed 12 are turning the attention back home as they assess what the attack means for @entity3 national security . @entity13 members privy to the @entity15 's top intelligence briefings criticized president @entity17 's terror - fighting policies and @entity3 national security agencies began scanning their databases thursday amid reports that the two gunmen in wednesdays ' attack traveled to @entity23 this summer and as suspicions swirled that the pair were influenced by @entity26 . and one @entity13 lawmaker is staying away from criticizing @entity17 , instead introducing legislation to keep @entity3 who join terror groups off @entity3 soil . @entity3 officials have been in close coordination with @entity35 officials as the hunt for the two gunmen continued into thursday and @entity3 attorney general @entity38 will travel to @entity6 on sunday to meet with the @entity35 interior minister and others to discuss counterterrorism and the threat of foreign fighters . but earlier in the day , sens. @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 called out what they view as the failures of the @entity17 administration 's fight against terrorism after walking out of an unrelated intelligence briefing . " as long as @entity26 succeeds , that will breed this kind of terrorist who goes to @entity23 , @entity58 and fight , return to the country from which they came from -- not only radicalized , but well trained , " @entity44 , chairman of the @entity53 said . " and that is the reason why the administration is failing in not devoting the sufficient effort to destroy @entity26 which is what the president 's stated goal is ... when in fact there is no strategy to do so . " @entity44 has repeatedly slammed @entity17 's foreign policy as too timid and has called for a wider campaign in @entity58 and @entity23 to accomplish the president 's goal to " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity26 , the militant group which has claimed broad swaths of territory in @entity58 and @entity23 . the @entity3 is leading a coalitions of countries from @entity78 and the @entity79 in a military campaign centered around airstrikes and military advisers to bolster @entity58 security forces and combat @entity26 . @entity17 has been repeatedly slammed for ruling out sending combat troops and criticized by @entity44 for not doing enough to help moderate rebels in @entity23 . @entity44 suggested @entity17 does n't understand " the gravity " of the radical @entity91 threat , which @entity93 's sen. @entity92 and @entity94 's sen. @entity46 echoed , attacking the president 's past claims that the @entity3 has decimated @entity96 's core and is on the path to victory in the war on terror . @entity17 made those comments before the rise of @entity26 , a group which grew out of remnants of @entity96 leadership in @entity58 . " despite the president 's assertion that the war on terror was over and that @entity96 was on the road to defeat , this is not accurate , " @entity46 said . and @entity92 focused on the growing threat of foreign fighters , thousands of which have left their homes in @entity78 and the @entity3 to fight in @entity23 -- some of whom risk returning to the @entity116 to carry out attacks . and amid suspicions that that was the case in @entity6 on wednesday , the @entity120 , @entity121 and intelligence agencies are evaluating high priority targets living in the @entity3 , including foreign fighters who may have returned to the @entity3 after fighting in @entity23 . " whenever something like this happens you want to make sure you tighten things up , " a @entity3 official with firsthand knowledge of the efforts told @entity1 . the attack in @entity6 is also giving new fire to legislation rep. @entity133 ( @entity134 ) believes will help prevent @entity3 who join @entity26 or other terrorist organizations from returning to the @entity3 @entity133 is reintroducing a bill in the coming days that will compel the @entity138 to revoke the passports of @entity3 who join or assist any foreign terrorist organization . @entity133 unsuccessfully pushed the legislation in the @entity143 in september , but he said the attack in @entity6 underscores the need for such legislation . " this tragedy in @entity6 lets us all know that homegrown terrorists exist all over the world , " said @entity133 , who is chairman of the subcommittee on homeland security . " they 're going to @entity23 , being trained and we do n't want them coming back into the @entity3 . " sen. @entity155 will also reintroduce similar legislation in the @entity15 , his spokeswoman @entity154 told @entity1 . the @entity157 @entity13 introduced a bill last year to strip @entity3 who join terrorist organizations of both their passports and their citizenship . reports indicate the pair of terrorists ( both @entity35 citizens ) traveled to @entity23 last summer and @entity133 suggested they would not have been able to return to @entity35 if similar legislation existed there . @entity1 law enforcement analyst @entity167 said revoking passports is an important tool , but the challenge will be determining whether an individual is actually joining a terror group . and with thousands of foreign fighters and hundreds of thousands on the terror watch list , @entity167 said people will inevitably slip through the cracks . @entity133 will also introduce two bills requiring the @entity138 in coordination with other agencies to submit reports on the flow of foreign fighters to @entity58 and @entity23 and terrorist groups ' use of social media , which groups like @entity26 have used to recruit and radicalize foreigners . @entity133 said he believes the @entity3 should work more closely with social media companies like @entity188 to purge sites of terrorist propaganda . " with what 's happened in @entity35 , @entity3 need to understand that this is an ongoing problem that we 're facing , " @entity133 said . @entity92 called the terrorist threat today greater than ever and said the @entity6 attack " reminds us that the terrorist threat is still very real for this country as well as for other @entity200 nations . " " the idea that the administration at one point said that core @entity96 had been decimated and that we were far safer is just not accurate , " @entity92 said . " and in all my time of studying homeland security issues and the terrorist threat i ca n't think of a time where the threat level is more dangerous . " @entity92 added that the @entity3 has greater capabilities today to thwart terror attacks , but that the expansive influence of @entity26 and other terror groups via the @entity214 and social media has created a " lone wolf problem , " which is harder to address . @entity3 and @entity35 law enforcement and intelligence agencies are still working to determine the circumstances behind the terror attack in @entity6 and whether the two brothers who attacked @entity35 publication @entity222 were acting on their own or with orders from a terrorist group , like @entity26 .	@entity23:Syria	@entity133:Ted Poe	@entity26:ISIS	@entity116:West	@entity138:State Department	@entity134:R-Texas	@entity13:Republican	@entity157:Texas	@entity155:Ted Cruz	@entity154:Catherine Frazier	@entity3:Americans	@entity44:McCain	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:Paris	@entity53:Armed Services Committee	@entity79:Middle East	@entity78:Europe	@entity58:Iraq	@entity17:Obama	@entity214:Internet	@entity15:Senate	@entity35:French	@entity38:Eric Holder	@entity96:al-Qaeda	@entity200:Western	@entity93:Maine	@entity92:Collins	@entity91:Islamist	@entity121:Department of Homeland Security	@entity188:Twitter	@entity222:Charlie Hebdo	@entity167:Fuentes	@entity143:House	@entity120:FBI	@entity45:Susan Collins	@entity46:Rubio	@entity94:Florida

@entity283 , an @placeholder whistleblower , says federal employees swear to uphold @entity49	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 deserves amnesty and the ability to return to the @entity3 without fear of being incarcerated for reporting crimes by people in high places in the @entity3 government . monday 's ruling by @entity3 district judge @entity10 that the @entity12 's widespread collection of millions of @entity3 ' telephone records was unconstitutional bolsters this view . but for some , whether to give @entity1 amnesty is not an easy matter to reconcile . after all , they say , he broke laws in divulging classified information . indeed , some say he is a traitor . but just as a member of the @entity3 military is not required to follow an unlawful order , it is proper that an employee of the @entity3 intelligence community -- @entity12 , @entity29 , @entity30 and others -- should report any information that concerns law - breaking by the intelligence agencies or their employees . an @entity12 official 's suggestion that amnesty for @entity1 could possibly be put on the table was undoubtedly welcome news for @entity1 , yet @entity12 director gen. @entity41 rejected the suggestion . but how can anyone believe that @entity1 would not be deserving of amnesty ? clearly it is the government and its senior officials who committed the crime -- people who took oaths to defend the @entity49 from enemies both foreign and domestic and who failed to take to heart the words they swore to uphold . indeed , @entity1 did not -- nor does any government employee -- swear allegiance to the president of the @entity3 , or even to the secretary of defense or the director of @entity12 . no , he swore to uphold and defend the @entity49 . unfortunately , while federal law protects whistleblowers who work in other government sectors from reprisals for truth - telling and have paths for reporting wrongdoing and mismanagement , those who work in intelligence are expressly denied such rights . when senior staff representative @entity72 and longtime senior @entity12 employees @entity74 , @entity75 , and i submitted a formal complaint about mismanagement at the agency , the government 's response on july 26 , 2007 , was to send the @entity80 to raid our homes , searching them for seven hours and seizing our computers , phones and other digital media . we are just now getting our property back after having successfully sued the government in december 2012 . the government even indicted @entity89 , although it dropped its criminal charges in the case against him . still , for the five of us , it was the equivalent of a punch in the face and a warning to other would - be " truth - tellers " not to report wrongful government activities or the government will come after you . @entity1 clearly saw what the government does to whistleblowers who try to work within government to fix things that are wrong . he knew that our complaint to the @entity108 inspector general in september 2002 went for naught . although the report agreed that our complaint was well - founded , nothing happened -- no one was found guilty of wrongful behavior or waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars . even before writing the complaint , we -- all longtime and senior @entity12 employees -- along with @entity72 , a senior staffer on the @entity117 , had approached @entity119 in 2001 about the matter of illegal collection of data about @entity3 citizens . no action . @entity1 might have known that we were ultimately punished by approaching officials , and even had our security clearances revoked when the @entity80 raided our homes -- despite the fact that four of the five of us were not indicted and none of us was found guilty of committing a crime . for employees in the business of intelligence , there are no honest brokers , no viable paths to follow to report the subverting of the @entity3 @entity49 . it is the reason @entity1 went first to @entity142 and ultimately @entity143 to seek refuge . he did not go to those places to give away national secrets , rather he needed a place to stay that was safe from extradition and where he could wait while the @entity3 sorted through the facts , especially those regarding government leaders who violated the most basic of our nation 's laws -- the right to privacy . it was shocking to see the interview on @entity160 a few years ago with the former director of @entity12 , @entity162 , and hear him redefine the @entity163 of the @entity3 @entity49 . when asked whether @entity12 had violated the @entity163 , @entity162 said it had not . @entity162 said " probable cause " was not the @entity163 's standard for violating a citizen 's privacy -- it was based on " reasonable suspicion . " recognizing that the whole matter of secret presidential orders and extreme interpretations of the @entity49 in regard to executive wartime authorities by the @entity3 @entity174 could be the subject of a book by themselves , one thing is clear -- no one asked either the @entity179 or the people of the @entity3 whether bulk collection of citizens ' phone metadata was constitutional . as we saw on monday , judge @entity10 does not think so . in recent days , @entity162 defended the actions of both the @entity187 and @entity188 administrations , stating that the @entity12 collection program was " blessed " by all three branches of the @entity3 government . what @entity162 has not said is that neither the @entity193 nor @entity119 had a good understanding of what was going on . the @entity12 contends it provided @entity119 with the opportunity to be briefed on the surveillance , but some members of @entity119 dispute that . @entity1 's revelations since june have certainly made it clear that no one -- except the @entity12 -- believes they had the whole truth about the extensiveness of its data collection efforts , whether from the @entity207 or from the phone system . perhaps more germane to this discussion whether @entity1 should receive amnesty and the matter of who committed the real crime -- @entity1 or the government -- is that the legal basis for @entity12 in defending its actions can be found in a single court case called @entity218 v @entity219 ( 1979 ) -- which went to the @entity179 at a time when there was hardly an internet and nobody even dreamed there would be cell phones , social network sites or @entity227 . in this case , touted by the government as legitimizing the bulk collection of metadata under @entity232 of the @entity233 , the police inserted a recording device at the telephone company to record the metadata -- phone number originating the call , time of call , number called and duration of conversation -- associated with a man suspected of robbing a lady . the alleged thief challenged the constitutionality of the police recording the metadata associated with the phone call , but the @entity179 backed the lower court 's decision that doing so under the circumstances was constitutional . now , one might ask how does the @entity179 's approval of the collection of metadata associated with a single phone call made by a suspected thief end up authorizing the bulk collection of phone metadata of hundreds of millions of @entity3 citizens by the most powerful spy agency in the world ? we all know that the field of law has its quirks , but it 's clear such an interpretation of law does not constitute justice , let alone make sense . with those facts as background , i think most @entity3 would agree that @entity1 deserves amnesty . in fact , it is those who allowed these programs to be implemented and developed over the past 12 years who should be prosecuted . after all , do we not stand for " equal justice for all " ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 .	@entity163:Fourth Amendment	@entity30:DIA	@entity218:Smith	@entity29:CIA	@entity117:House Permanent Select Subcommittee on Intelligence	@entity89:Tom Drake	@entity119:Congress	@entity3:Americans	@entity233:Patriot Act	@entity1:Snowden	@entity0:CNN	@entity174:Department of Justice	@entity179:Supreme Court	@entity193:Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court	@entity219:Maryland	@entity75:Ed Loomis	@entity74:Bill Binney	@entity142:Hong Kong	@entity72:Diane Roark	@entity232:Section 215	@entity12:NSA	@entity10:Richard Leon	@entity108:United States Department of Defense	@entity207:Internet	@entity188:Obama	@entity80:FBI	@entity160:MSNBC	@entity162:Hayden	@entity227:Twitter	@entity143:Moscow	@entity187:Bush	@entity283:Wiebe	@entity41:Keith Alexander	@entity49:Constitution
new : @placeholder calls the government plan a " recipe for bloodshed "	@entity50	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 's military - backed government signaled wednesday that it plans to disperse supporters of deposed president @entity5 camped out at sit - ins in @entity0 , raising fears it will trigger violent confrontations . citing a threat to national security and traffic congestion , interim interior minister @entity11 was authorized to take " all necessary measures to face these dangers and end them , " information minister @entity10 said in a televised speech following the weekly @entity19 meeting . " the acts of terrorism and the blocking of roads are no longer acceptable and represent a threat to national security and terrorize citizens , " @entity10 said . the statement is being widely interpreted by local media outlets as a green light for security forces to disperse the thousands of protesters at the sit - ins at squares in @entity33 and @entity34 . the announcement comes just days after more than 150 people died in clashes in @entity0 and @entity38 , killings that were widely condemned by world leaders and the @entity41 . protesters accused police of opening fire and killing 72 people during a @entity46 demonstration in @entity47 , an area of @entity0 where the @entity48 has made its base . @entity50 called the announcement " a recipe for further bloodshed .

" @entity2 mayor @entity35 said people at the shelter recognized @entity14 from televised photos of the suspect . @entity14 is suspected in the october 31 shooting of @entity2 police officer @entity41 . @entity41 was shot in the head when he inadvertently walked into a robbery in progress at a @entity45 . he died the next day . investigators told @entity26 that @entity14 was spotted on security video boarding a bus to @entity9 on saturday night . @entity41 was one of three @entity2 police officers shot in a four - day period last week . @entity50 was shot in the shoulder late last tuesday as he approached a vehicle . he is in fair condition . officer @entity55 was shot early last sunday and is out of the hospital and doing well , police say . former co-workers of @entity14 who spoke to @entity26 said they were surprised by the allegations against him .

@entity12 said penalties would be imposed on @placeholder 's @entity14	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 has slapped sanctions on three firms including a major @entity5 oil trader for selling refined oil products to @entity7 , just days after @entity1 treasury secretary @entity8 travelled to @entity9 to press for @entity5 support on @entity7 sanctions . the @entity12 announced late thursday night that penalties would be imposed on @entity15 's @entity14 , the @entity17 - based oil trader @entity16 oil , and the @entity21 - based independent oil trader @entity19 . while the measures are unlikely to have a big immediate impact on these three companies , they send a strong warning signal to energy companies working in @entity7 at a time when the @entity1 has been canvassing @entity30 countries for more support in isolating @entity32 . the @entity12 called the sanctions against the three firms an " important " step in convincing @entity7 to change its behaviour , and highlighted the " potential connection between @entity7 's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of its proliferation [ of ] sensitive nuclear activities . " a spokesperson for @entity14 said the company had not sold gasoline to @entity7 . " we 've never exported a barrel , not even a wee bit of refined fuel to @entity7 , " said @entity46 , director of the public affairs department . according to the statement , the three firms violated @entity1 restrictions on supplying @entity7 with refined oil products that were passed in 2010 . " under the sanctions imposed today , all three companies are barred from receiving @entity1 export licenses , @entity1 @entity60 financing , and loans over $ 10m from @entity1 financial institutions , " the @entity12 said . importing refined oil products like petrol and diesel is crucial for @entity7 's economy because the country does n't have sufficient refining infrastructure to process enough of its own crude into products . @entity15 is the biggest buyer of @entity7 's crude oil and , according to the @entity12 , is also a significant source of gasoline for @entity7 , but @entity5 companies have until now avoided sanctions from the @entity1 . @entity15 supported the most recent @entity80 sanctions resolution on @entity7 in 2010 , and some analysts believe that in exchange for that support the @entity1 may have turned a blind eye to @entity5 companies which may have violated @entity1 laws . last year the @entity1 placed sanctions on seven companies for selling refined oil products to @entity7 , but none of those were @entity5 . @entity14 is a state - owned oil trader based in @entity15 . the company has a special mandate from the @entity94 to do crude trades that offset military trade debt with @entity98 countries , according to their website . ms @entity46 , the spokesperson for @entity14 , said the company would continue buying @entity7 crude . " @entity14 's trade with @entity7 is carried out under the two governments . the trade accords with international law and @entity5 laws and regulations , " she said . " what we 've signed with @entity7 are long - term contracts and we import around 12m tonnes of crude from @entity7 each year , " ms @entity46 said . " we 've never exported gasoline to @entity7 . this is out of thin air ! " the @entity12 said @entity14 is @entity7 's largest supplier of refined oil products , brokering sales of gasoline worth more than $ 500m between july 2010 and january 2011 . the sanctions are likely to have little immediate impact on @entity14 because the company does very little , if any , business in the @entity1 . additional reporting by @entity124 in @entity9	@entity17:Singapore	@entity16:Kuo	@entity1:U.S.	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Iran	@entity12:US State Department	@entity5:Chinese	@entity30:Asian	@entity9:Beijing	@entity8:Tim Geithner	@entity15:China	@entity19:FAL	@entity80:United Nations	@entity46:Zheng	@entity21:UAE	@entity32:Tehran	@entity98:Middle Eastern	@entity14:Zhuhai Zhenrong	@entity94:State Council	@entity124:Gwen Chen	@entity60:Export Import Bank
@entity22 's girlfriend says they were supposed to marry in @placeholder	@entity35	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the mother of one of the two @entity5 men arrested last week at a @entity0 airport allegedly on their way to fight with an @entity9 - affiliated group in @entity10 says the two men are guilty of stupidity -- but not of the sinister plan described by authorities . " anything makes him angry . but he 's not a terrorist ; he 's a stupid kid , " @entity17 said of her @entity19 - born son , @entity18 . @entity22 , 20 , of @entity23 , @entity5 , and @entity22 , 24 , of @entity24 , @entity5 , are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill , maim and murder persons outside of the @entity19 , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison . the men , who were taken into custody at @entity33 on june 5 , intended to take separate flights to @entity35 on their way to @entity10 " to join designated foreign terrorist organization @entity37 and wage violent jihad , " according to federal prosecutors . the criminal complaint filed in @entity41 in @entity42 alleges that in 2007 , @entity17 and @entity43 traveled together to @entity44 , where they intended to enter @entity46 to commit violence against @entity19 troops there . @entity17 told @entity1 that her son went to 16 or 17 psychiatrists for what she called " anger management issues " that surfaced when he was a boy . he lived at his parents well - kept home , where his angry outbursts were common . however , she said , he was n't particularly religious . " he slept late . if he was devout , he would make his prayers on time . he did n't , " she said . she helped him pack for his trip to @entity35 , though she said she resisted the idea from the start . @entity17 said she was reassured by a man named " @entity62 , " who had befriended her son and @entity22 . " he said we 're gon na study @entity66 . i said but here there are many schools . but he say in @entity35 , they 're better , " she recalled being told by the man when she expressed concerns about @entity17 moving to @entity35 . " do n't worry , i take care of them , " she said @entity62 told her days before her son and @entity22 were arrested boarding a flight to @entity35 . she said she believes the man was an undercover federal agent who recorded her son making incendiary comments against the @entity19 and continued to build the case against him and @entity22 . " since i saw him , i warned my son and @entity22 , " @entity17 said . " but my son say ' always you say about my friends they are undercover . ' " the @entity17 family invited @entity1 on saturday also talk to a woman who said she was set to marry @entity22 upon his arrival in @entity35 . @entity17 said she met her son 's girlfriend the night before . the 19 - year - old woman , who said her name is @entity89 , sat at the family 's home , cloaked in a niqab , a veil that covers the entire body and face with only a sheer cloth revealing the eyes . she said she met @entity22 in an online chat room . @entity89 showed @entity1 her passport stamped june 9 , 2010 , indicating her arrival at @entity33 from @entity101 , @entity102 . she also produced her airline itinerary , which shows that her trip started in @entity105 -- where , she says , she was waiting for @entity22 . " we were supposed to get married and study awhile in @entity35 . that was the plan , " @entity89 told @entity1 . she said she moved from @entity109 , where she was born to @entity35 parents , to @entity105 at @entity17 's behest a few months ago . when he did n't arrive in @entity105 on june 6 , she was shocked to learn from a friend in @entity0 that her soon - to - be fiance had been arrested . " she told me that @entity22 got arrested for terrorism and that they were saying he was going to @entity10 , " @entity89 said in disbelief . " so i did n't know what to do ; words ca n't explain what i felt . i was in shock and i could n't stop crying . " she said she boarded a flight and arrived in @entity0 a day before @entity17 's arraignment thursday . it was then that she saw him for the first time , through a veil in a federal courtroom . " i did n't have any ticket booked or anything . i just went to the airport and i booked a ticket from there , and i left , " @entity89 said . @entity1 recently learned that @entity17 and @entity22 were followers of an extreme @entity135 group based in @entity0 . @entity1 obtained an image of the two suspects attending a protest in @entity0 organized by the @entity139 on june 1 . they appear to have been taking part in a demonstration against @entity142 . one is holding a banner , the other an @entity139 poster that includes the slogan , " exterminate the @entity147 . " the society 's video of the event , posted on its @entity152 channel , has since been removed . the rally took place a week before the two men made their way to @entity33 airport and were arrested . " my soul can not rest till i shed blood . i wan na like be the world 's [ best ] known terrorist , " @entity17 is alleged to have told an undercover agent in the @entity19 last year . later he said , " we 'll start doing killing here , if i ca n't do it over there . " another image -- from late 2008 -- shows @entity22 at a different rally , holding a poster that says " death to all juice " ( sic ) . it 's not clear whether that rally was organized by the @entity139 . when asked about the rallies @entity17 attended , @entity89 insisted his presence was a show of outrage -- not intent . " but that does n't make him a terrorist . that only shows how much he dislikes what the people are doing to the @entity186 , " she said . " that does n't show he was going to @entity10 and do anything .

" @entity3 : " i think protecting your family and giving to them is the most important achievement .

@entity3 : it 's a city of contrasts . you have this great culture and traditions that are very normal , calm and established . and then you have explosions of emotion , craziness , art , and young people who are so proud to be @entity0 and really trying to be individuals . @entity0 is a huge inspiration for me . i love what i find here , i love being here . @entity2 : what would you change about @entity0 given the chance ? @entity38 : definitely the way it 's treated at the moment , the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings . to me it 's a little bit sad because in the @entity47 people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings , keeping them as intact as possible . watch @entity3 take @entity2 on a tour of @entity0 . ¬ª @entity2 : what 's the fashion in @entity0 ? @entity38 : you see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket . it 's really funny ! @entity2 : tell me about your childhood @entity38 : i was born in @entity62 to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when i was very little . she was a single mum and had two more girls . it was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other . my mum was amazing ; she never drank , she never smoked -- she lived for us . i appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me . @entity2 : is family very important to you ? @entity38 : i think protecting your family and giving to them is so important . it 's the most important achievement . @entity2 : how did your modeling career take off ? @entity38 : i went to @entity81 when i was 17 . i was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- i always had good work but i was n't a star straight away . in fact , my agency thought that i might never do shows because i was a bit shorter and not skinny enough , but when i gave birth to my first son i was 19 and i lost a lot of weight . i guess the stress on the body was extreme and i suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models . my career took off after @entity99 was born because i opened a lot of shows on the runway and that 's where a lot of stars are made in my industry . see @entity3 's @entity0 in photos . ¬ª @entity2 : if you were n't a model , what would your life be like ? @entity38 : it 's very hard to say what my life would be like if i had n't gone to @entity81 . people say i did n't change very much but i do n't think that 's true . i 'm a happy person and even if i thought that i was happy then , i had so much baggage to carry with me : my background , people 's expectations , the fact that i was n't a perfect student and i was n't going to school all the time -- i did n't live a normal life at all . that 's not with me anymore , because of my success . it really does n't matter because i know i have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods . @entity2 : tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it ? @entity38 : i started my foundation in 2005 , after the @entity138 tragedy [ the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed ] . i was in @entity0 at the time and it just struck me so much . i went back to @entity143 , where i was living at the time , organized a fundraising event and raised $ 350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area . i believe that play is very therapeutic . it 's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children , even if it 's only for five minutes . but then i realized that it would be good for all the other children in @entity1 and i just started raising money and building playgrounds . now we have 23 places all over @entity1 and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more . i want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in @entity1 . each one will cost about $ 300,000 so it 's a big dream -- an expensive one ! @entity2 : let 's talk about vodka ... @entity38 : our vodka is definitely the best . it 's a very pure , good drink and it goes with @entity1 food . generally i do n't drink vodka outside @entity1 , but when you come to @entity1 there is no reason to order a glass of wine . @entity2 : what do you think of your nickname -- supernova ?

change is reflection of " common sense " and " common decency , " @placeholder says	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- defense secretary @entity2 announced thursday that the @entity3 will start to ease its enforcement of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy prohibiting homosexuals from serving openly in the military . among other things , @entity2 said the @entity3 is raising the threshold for what constitutes an appropriate level of information necessary to launch a " credible inquiry " into allegations of homosexual behavior . the change , which will take effect in 30 days and apply to all current cases , is a reflection of " common sense " and " common decency , " @entity2 said . " these changes reflect some of the insights we have gained over 17 years of implementing the current law , including the need for consistency , oversight and clear standards . " president @entity30 and adm. @entity31 , chairman of the @entity32 , support a legislative repeal of " @entity34 , " which was first enacted in 1993 . some senior members of the military , however , have expressed concern over the impact of the ban 's repeal on unit cohesion and morale , among other things . is this the right move ? share your thoughts last month , @entity2 announced the @entity3 had taken the first steps to prepare for a repeal of the policy . laying the groundwork for such a change will take more than a year , he said . in the interim , he said , the @entity3 will start enforcing the policy " in a fairer manner . " @entity2 said thursday that , moving ahead : the @entity3 will raise the level of the officer authorized to start a fact - finding inquiry or separation proceeding as a result of alleged homosexual conduct to a general or flag officer in the accused service member 's chain of command . only a lieutenant colonel , @entity67 commander or higher ranking officer will be authorized to conduct a fact - finding inquiry . only a general or flag officer in an accused service member 's chain of command will be authorized to initiate expulsion proceedings . the @entity3 will revise what constitutes credible information to begin an inquiry or separation proceeding . for example , @entity2 , said , the @entity3 will specify that information given by third parties should be given under oath . the use of " overheard statements " and " hearsay " will be discouraged . the @entity3 will revise what constitutes a " reliable person " upon which an inquiry can be initiated . according to @entity2 , " special scrutiny " will be given to " third parties who may be motivated to harm a service member . " certain categories of confidential information will no longer be used in discharge proceedings , including information provided to lawyers , clergy and psychotherapists . information provided to a doctor as part of a service member 's medical treatment or to a medical official in the course of a public health inquiry also will not be used in discharge proceedings . information given for either a security clearance investigation or in the course of seeking professional assistance for domestic or physical abuse also will be excluded . last month , @entity2 told members of the @entity114 that " a guiding principle of our efforts [ to change the policy on gays in the military ] will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks , with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines . " @entity2 also said the @entity3 will ask the @entity127 to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military . since the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was implemented , more than 13,500 service members have been discharged , according to @entity135 rep. @entity134 , @entity136 . in 2009 , there were 428 discharges under the policy , the lowest rate of discharge since implementation , he said . the highest year was 2001 , with 1,227 discharges . sixty - nine percent of @entity135 believe openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military , according to a february 12 - 15 @entity147 poll . twenty - seven percent are opposed to such a change , the survey found . in 1994 , shortly after the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was implemented , 53 percent of @entity135 believed openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military , while 41 percent were opposed . @entity1 's @entity152 and @entity153 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Pentagon	@entity2:Gates	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity34:do n't ask , do n't tell	@entity30:Obama	@entity67:Navy	@entity135:Americans	@entity147:CNN / Opinion Research Corp.	@entity32:Joint Chiefs of Staff	@entity134:Jim Moran	@entity153:Barbara Starr	@entity152:Alan Silverleib	@entity127:RAND Corp.	@entity136:D-Virginia	@entity114:Senate Armed Services Committee	@entity31:Mike Mullen
@placeholder is being sued over the fatal crash that killed @entity5 and race car driver @entity1	@entity2	@entity1 ' widow is suing @entity2 for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of her race car driver husband and actor @entity5 . @entity7 filed the suit this week against @entity9 , citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40 - year - old " @entity18 " star on november 30 in @entity16 , @entity17 . backed by celebrity attorney @entity19 , she is also suing for product liability and wrongful death . @entity1 , 38 at the time of his death , spent his competitive racing career driving @entity2 cars . according to the court documents , he and @entity5 first met on the race track when @entity1 was driving a @entity2 owned by the actor . a few years later the two men formed the racing team @entity30 , where they were both drivers . " although mr. @entity1 had a passion for cars , mr. @entity1 was first and foremost dedicated to his family , his wife , @entity7 , and their two young children , " the complaint states . the court documents filed by @entity7 describe the 2005 @entity38 that her husband was driving as a an " ultra-high - performance - super - sports car for the road , " that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour . the complaint argues that such a high - powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection , and that a mechanical malfunction forced @entity1 to veer off the road . @entity19 also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene , who determined that @entity1 was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control . this contradicts the @entity56 coroner 's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph , and the investigations by the @entity59 and @entity60 that focused on speed . @entity2 pointed to the discrepancy . " as you know , the crash was subject of a very detailed investigation by the authorities , both the @entity60 and the @entity69 , " said @entity63 , head of public relations for @entity9 . " the reports showed that driving at a high speed in a negligent manner caused the crash . both concluded that there was no mechanical defect of the vehicle involved . " " their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit .

@placeholder forsakes old putter as he bids for third straight win at @entity11	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 will have a new putter in his hands as he bids to make golfing history by becoming the first player to win the @entity6 at the same venue three times in a row after earlier triumphs at @entity11 in 2000 and 2005 . the troubled world number one begins his challenge at the home of golf on thursday morning as he tees off with @entity16 's in - form @entity18 and @entity20 's @entity19 and will have a new addition to his golf bag . woods told gathered reporters tuesday that he was forsaking the club which had helped him to 13 of his 14 majors in favor of a heavier putter to tackle the greens of the @entity30 . " i 've always struggled on slower greens and the one i 've gone to this week comes off faster and i 've had to make very little adjustment , " he said . @entity1 has played three practice rounds in windy conditions on the @entity37 coast , having arrived on sunday . the @entity38 took part in a charity pro-am event in @entity41 at the beginning of last week and would normally have gone straight to @entity11 , but instead flew home to see his two children . @entity1 again refused to comment on reports of a divorce settlement with his @entity48 wife @entity47 . he went into self - imposed exile from golf at the beginning of the year after revelations of marital infidelity provoked unfavorable headlines . facing persistent questioning from reporters on his private life , @entity1 claimed it would have no effect on his performance this week . " ( the scandal ) does n't impact it at all . i 'm here to play a championship , " @entity1 said . " this is the @entity6 at @entity11 . this is as good as it gets . it 's the home of golf . i 'm just like every other player in this field . " @entity23 is without a win since his return to the circuit in april , but has finished shared fourth in both the @entity75 and the recent @entity76 . he told his personal website that despite his winless streak , he was happy with his general game as he bids for a 15th major crown . " i have been driving it on a string . the club feels so good in my hands , " @entity1 said . " i went back to my fundamentals with my putting and my stroke feels good . " @entity1 won at @entity11 in 2000 by eight shots and five in 2005 but missed the cut in last year 's @entity6 at @entity89 . despite being installed as favorite with bookmakers , @entity1 appears to have lost his aura of invincibility , but three - time major winner @entity94 said that could all change quickly . " @entity1 finishing fourth in a major is considered a failure -- it is amazing what expectations can do because in those two performances he could have won both , " he told @entity97 's @entity96 . " but if he comes out and wins , wins , wins then players will be intimidated by him , " he added . @entity110 @entity109 captain @entity108 , second to @entity1 on the @entity30 in 2005 , also believes @entity23 can do a ' three - peat ' at @entity11 if he can use his new putter to good effect . " it would be the tough guy to bet against him on a course that is entirely suited to his strength , which is putting , " he told @entity96 . @entity23 ' great rival @entity119 is second favorite with most odds makers but comes into the tournament off the back of missing the cut in the @entity125 at @entity126 and a mediocre record at the @entity6 , with a best of third place in 2004 . @entity119 also has another chance to overtake @entity1 as world number one , but only a victory and his fifth major title will definitely secure him top spot .	@entity23:Woods	@entity20:Colombia	@entity16:England	@entity108:Colin Montgomerie	@entity139:World number Woods	@entity110:European	@entity89:Turnberry	@entity119:Phil Mickelson	@entity1:Woods	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:British Open	@entity75:U.S Masters	@entity76:U.S. Open	@entity126:Loch Lomond	@entity30:Old Course	@entity11:St.Andrews	@entity38:American	@entity19:Camilo Villegas	@entity18:Justin Rose	@entity97:UK	@entity96:Press Association	@entity125:Scottish Open	@entity37:Scottish	@entity47:Elin	@entity41:Ireland	@entity94:Padraig Harrington	@entity48:Swedish	@entity109:Ryder Cup

the @placeholder crashed short of the runway ; three people were killed , 187 hurt	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- pilots botched the approach and landing of @entity6 in @entity7 nearly a year ago , causing a crash that killed three people and injured 187 others , @entity2 safety investigators concluded on tuesday . but the @entity11 also found that crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the @entity15 and how it was described in operating manuals contributed to the july 6 disaster . investigators , however , primarily faulted the crew of the @entity21 - based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people before it struck a seawall and careened down @entity27 trailing sparks and debris . read the @entity11 's accident report summary in a final report on its probe , the board found that the flight crew mismanaged the plane 's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed . the crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe , investigators found . the final conclusion was largely in line with early assumptions of investigators facing the most serious commercial airline crash in the @entity2 since a @entity56 commuter plane fell out of the sky over @entity58 , killing 49 people in february 2009 . crew actions were also singled out in that accident . aviation experts agree that aircraft automation has made flying safer , and the 777 is one of the most sophisticated jetliners in service . " but the more complex automation becomes , the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it , " @entity67 , the acting safety board chairman said in a statement .

but large numbers of guns are flowing from the @placeholder to @entity2 , she says	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- violence in the @entity4 is not related to illegal @entity2 immigrants , but violence in @entity2 is connected to vast shipments of weapons from the @entity4 , @entity2 's foreign minister told @entity0 thursday . foreign minister @entity11 pointed to efforts by @entity2 to stop the flow of weapons , the great majority of which come from the @entity4 . " since 2006 , " she said in a wide - ranging interview with @entity0 's editorial board in @entity19 , " the @entity2 government has seized over 85,000 weapons in @entity2 . " she noted that it 's not just " regular weapons , " but also machine guns , grenades and other high - power arms . @entity25 , a @entity26 national security adviser for president @entity27 in the late 1970s , pointed out last year there were at least 6,600 @entity4 gun shops within 100 miles of the @entity2 border and more than 90 percent of weapons in @entity2 come from the @entity4 . in contrast , @entity11 said , there 's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration , as some @entity4 politicians have contended . the two largest latino populations in the @entity4 are in the @entity19 and @entity40 areas , she said , but both locales have seen a " dramatic drop in the crime rate . " government and police statistics show that the crime rate has been decreasing in @entity19 for the past 15 years . similarly , statistics show that rate for most major crimes in @entity40 also has fallen in recent years . " this clearly shows that linking immigration directly with violence is not connected , " @entity11 said . others make the case , however , that illegal immigration and high crime are strongly linked . supporters of @entity61 , the controversial @entity62 immigration law , parts of which were struck down in federal court in july , used that argument to pass the bill this year . " border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state , " @entity62 gov. @entity66 said earlier this year . " there is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of @entity62 . we can not sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels . we can not stand idly by as drop houses , kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life . " but statistics from the @entity87 agency and the @entity88 indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime have decreased recently . according to the @entity88 , violent crimes reported in @entity62 dropped by nearly 1,500 incidents between 2005 and 2008 . reported property crimes also fell , from about 287,000 incidents to 279,000 in the same period . these decreases are accentuated by the fact that @entity62 's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008 . according to the non-partisan @entity100 , proponents of the bill " overlook two salient points : crime rates have already been falling in @entity62 for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants , and a century 's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native - born . " @entity11 also addressed comments by secretary of state @entity113 earlier this month comparing @entity2 's drug war to an " insurgency " similar to the problem @entity117 faced more than 20 years ago . " [ @entity121 ] e face an increasing threat from a well - organized network , [ a ] drug - trafficking threat that is , in some cases , morphing into or making common cause with what we would consider an insurgency , in @entity2 and in @entity131 , " @entity118 said at a speech to the @entity120 . " it 's looking more and more like @entity117 looked 20 years ago . " @entity2 officials , from president @entity133 on down , took exception to that characterization . @entity11 reiterated the point thursday . " the realities are very different , " she said . @entity117 , she said , was fighting drug - producing and drug - trafficking organizations that also were working with an entrenched @entity141 guerrilla movement . " in @entity2 , " she said , " the situation is very different . in @entity2 , we are dealing with very powerful and strong transnational criminal organizations . " @entity11 also addressed the issue of drug cartels spreading south to @entity131 nations , which seems to have become a bigger problem in recent years . " the world is becoming smaller every day , " she said , adding that " transnational organized crime does not recognize any borders . " and while the problem is not particularly new , she said , " what has changed is the power of these transnational crime organizations . " @entity11 said some governments in @entity131 have gotten weaker or do n't have the technological capabilities to fight crime , and the drug cartels have taken advantage .

@entity1 answers phone calls for @entity34 's @placeholder tracker	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- first lady @entity1 got into the @entity3 spirit saturday by helping field phone calls from excited children eagerly tracking @entity6 and his sleigh full of toys across the world . " i 've spotted a little dot , flashing dot that is over -- right now , @entity6 's sleigh is over the country of @entity14 . and he 's delivering toys there , " @entity1 told three siblings . " it looks like he 's got all nine reindeer with him . and it looks like that sleigh is pretty full -- yep , that 's what the experts here are saying . " @entity1 took the phone calls from @entity28 where the first family is vacationing for @entity3 . she helped track @entity6 's toy delivery route via a @entity32 map specially created each year by the @entity33 , also known as @entity34 . a tiny @entity6 icon is used to show his current location while a countdown clock below the map lets users know where he 'll take his sleigh next . most of the children she spoke to were more concerned with finding out @entity6 's whereabouts than talking to the first lady , but one parent appeared to catch @entity1 by surprise when he asked , " what do you want for @entity3 this year from @entity6 ? " " oh , my goodness , " @entity1 replied .

funeral service held for @entity6 veteran @placeholder	@entity13	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- the last @entity4 soldier to serve in @entity6 was buried thursday , marking " the passing of a generation , " the @entity4 veterans minister said . the coffin draped in a @entity11 flag is taken away from @entity12 . @entity13 died july 25 at the age of 111 , a week after fellow @entity4 @entity6 veteran @entity15 died at the age of 113 . a party of pallbearers escorting his coffin was made up of two @entity24 , two @entity23 , and two @entity22 infantrymen , while his coffin was carried by six soldiers from a unit that incorporated the one he served in during @entity6 i. patch was buried in the cathedral in the city of @entity33 , southwest @entity0 , where he lived . he joined the army at the age of 18 and fought in the @entity37 at @entity38 , @entity24 , in 1917 . he was seriously wounded in the battle , in which more than 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends . " today marks the passing of a generation , and of a man who dedicated his final years to spreading the message of peace and reconciliation , " veterans minister @entity45 said . " active participation in the @entity6 is now no longer part of living memory in this country , but @entity13 will continue to be a symbol of the bravery and sacrifice shown by him and those he served with , " he said . " in his passing we have lost our last living link to the fighting in the trenches of the @entity66 and a member of a generation that stood firm in the face of extraordinary adversity and unimaginable suffering , " said gen. @entity59 , the head of the @entity4 army . " but today above all else we give thanks for the life of a brave and inspirational man whose message of reconciliation and peace has reached and touched so many , " he said . the funeral was attended by the acting head of the @entity4 government and the wife of @entity83 , among thousands of others , the @entity78 said . patch was the last @entity4 man living in the @entity4 to have served in the trenches on the @entity66 , the @entity78 said . born in 1898 , @entity13 became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916 . his unit , @entity89 , was rushed to the front - line trenches of @entity38 , where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousands . he fought in the trenches between june and september of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war . in late september he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head , bringing an end to his military service . he received battlefield treatment without anesthetic . after the war ended in 1918 , @entity13 returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer . he married @entity107 , a young woman he met while convalescing after the battle . they married in 1919 and had two sons . in @entity111 , @entity13 joined the @entity112 and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy @entity22 raids on the @entity0 cities of @entity116 and @entity117 . at one point he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near @entity123 , in southwest @entity0 , where he became friendly with some of the men . patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted , with coffee still hot and meals half - eaten , on the morning that the soldiers had gone off for the invasion of @entity23 , the @entity78 said . his wife , @entity133 , died in 1976 , and their two sons also later died . @entity13 remarried in 1980 , but he became a widower for the second time four years later . patch did n't speak about the war until he turned 100 , the @entity78 said . " he tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible ; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life , " a @entity78 biography says . " that suited @entity13 ; he could ' forget ' his demons , the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends . " in 1998 , a television producer with an interest in the war talked to @entity13 , who then made the decision to speak of his memories , the ministry said . he took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up . it was n't long before @entity13 became a spokesman for his generation , speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions , the ministry said . " in speaking about his experiences , @entity13 began at last to come to terms with his war , and was at peace with himself and his memories , " the ministry said . " his thoughts then turned to reconciliation , to the long - term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering . " @entity13 returned to @entity24 in 2002 , something he had said he would never do , and laid a wreath in honor of his battalion , the @entity177 said . two years later , he met and shook hands with a @entity22 artilleryman from the @entity66 , @entity184 . patch later laid a wreath at @entity187 for the @entity22 war dead . in his last years , @entity13 was honored at @entity189 and the prime minister 's residence at 10 @entity192 . on his 101st birthday @entity23 awarded him the knighthood of the @entity195 , and this year president @entity196 upgraded that to the rank of officer . last year , @entity199 made patch a @entity200 of the @entity201 .

@entity184 fought and spied as a man during the @placeholder	@entity99	( @entity0 ) -- behind every good war are many good women . using their feminine ( and in at least one case masculine ) wiles , the following five spies would make @entity7 proud . @entity8 was posthumously awarded the @entity9 for her spy service . 1 . @entity11 while @entity13 ( 1876 -- 1917 ) may not have caused @entity14 , she sure as heck kept it going . having spent time in @entity17 with her husband , captain @entity18 , @entity13 returned to @entity19 and sued for divorce . to make ends meet she took up exotic dancing and the name @entity11 ( meaning " the light of day " in @entity24 ) . with her sensual performances becoming the attraction of the major @entity30 cities came the men and the gifts for her favors . many of these favors came from royalty and high - ranking @entity39 and @entity40 military officers . as @entity14 progressed , both sides became suspicious that @entity11 was spying for the other side . the @entity39 eventually put her on trial and , although the charges were never proven , @entity11 was convicted of espionage and was executed by a firing squad on october 15 , 1917 . playing the seductress up until the end , @entity11 refused a blindfold , smiled , and blew a kiss to the firing squad as the fatal shots were fired . @entity0 : when a criminal survives execution 2 . @entity8 @entity56 was born in 1914 and at a young age moved with her family first to @entity60 and then to @entity39 . in 1940 , @entity56 , along with her mother and sister , escaped back to @entity60 just before @entity39 surrendered to @entity40 . while in @entity60 she joined the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , but her ability to speak fluent @entity39 soon caught the attention of the @entity68 and @entity56 agreed to become a spy . @entity56 was flown to @entity70 , where she teamed up with other female spies and traveled to @entity73 , @entity39 . there they joined the @entity76 . soon after their arrival , the network was infiltrated and many were arrested . @entity56 was ordered to return to @entity60 , but instead she stayed on and continued to pass information on to @entity60 . eventually she was arrested again and interrogated by the @entity83 . when she refused to speak , she was sent to a prison in @entity40 and then to the @entity86 concentration camp . on september 13 , 1944 , @entity56 and three other female @entity88 spies were executed by the @entity89 in 1949 , @entity56 was posthumously awarded the @entity9 . 3 . @entity90 ( aka " @entity91 " ) born @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , in 1844 , the beautiful @entity90 soon became the star attraction in @entity96 , social circles prior to the beginning of the @entity99 . with the outbreak of the war , she returned to @entity93 . when the @entity103 soldiers occupied the city , @entity90 mixed with the officers and soon gathered information on troop movements , which she passed on to the @entity109 forces . however , she is probably best known for warning @entity110 that the @entity103 intended to blow up all the bridges around @entity93 . with this information , @entity112 , with a small number of troops , was able to surprise the @entity103 troops and drive them from the area . in 1864 , @entity109 president @entity118 asked @entity90 to carry letters for him to @entity60 . the @entity120 captured her ship , but the officer in charge fell in love with @entity90 and let her escape . the officer , lieutenant @entity126 , after being courtmartialed and discharged from the @entity120 , traveled to @entity60 , where he married @entity90 . after the war , @entity127 toured the @entity129 as an actress under the stage name of @entity132 . 4 . @entity133 @entity134 , as she was known , was born in @entity135 , @entity94 , in 1818 but educated at a @entity137 school in @entity138 , @entity139 . after developing a hatred for slavery , @entity133 returned to @entity135 and freed all her family 's slaves . she also went so far as finding where her freed slaves ' relatives were and purchased and freed them also . after the @entity99 started , @entity133 asked to visit @entity103 prisoners being held captive in @entity135 . the @entity103 prisoners gave her information , which she then passed on to the @entity149 . among the slaves she freed was @entity152 , whom @entity153 got a job as a house servant in the home of @entity118 . this allowed @entity152 and @entity153 to collect and pass on information directly from the @entity109 president 's mansion . @entity133 effectively used the @entity134 moniker to make the residents of @entity135 think she was mentally ill. she would wear old clothes and bonnets and talk to herself . because of this , most people thought that her @entity168 sympathies were just a part of her craziness . @entity0 : @entity109 's plan to conquer @entity172 after the war , president @entity173 named @entity133 the postmaster for @entity135 . when the citizens of @entity135 found out that @entity134 was an act , they shunned her . however , at her death , the state of @entity180 placed a memorial marker on her grave . 5 . @entity184 ( or was it @entity186 ? ) born in 1841 in @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity184 ran away from home in her early teens . in order to survive she became an itinerant @entity193 salesman , by calling herself @entity186 and dressing like a man . in 1861 , @entity186 ( @entity184 ) enlisted in the @entity195 and over the next two years not only fought in a number of @entity99 battles , but also served as a spy for the @entity103 . solders in her unit called @entity186 " our woman " because of his feminine mannerisms and his extremely small boot size . however , none of her comrades ever figured out that @entity186 was really @entity184 . @entity0 : celebrity or look -

" it will enable me to play for @entity3 and the @entity12 in the same season , with the possibility of been able to keep up my commitments with @entity29 and the development of soccer in the @entity17 , something which i 'm very passionate about . " the deal follows weeks of negotiations between the two clubs during which @entity3 baulked at the size of the transfer fee @entity12 were demanding -- thought to be around ¬£ 12million . @entity12 's chief executive , @entity38 , admits the deal is one which suits both clubs . " i 'm sorry that it had to go for so long , for him and for us and particularly for the fans , " he told the @entity42 . " this is a good solution . it allows him to finish the season with @entity3 . we will see him in july .

" he added : " the aim was to keep him until june 30 and we have done that . he is very happy with the solution that has been found and we will make the most of having him now and then we will see . " sunday 's victory gave @entity3 a five - point gap over fourth - placed @entity67 , who lost 2 - 0 at home to @entity70 . @entity53 said @entity4 had helped lift the club out of a crisis after their @entity74 exit . " he gave us a real helping hand . it was a tough match and for most of the first half @entity7 caused us problems , " he said . " then @entity4 's ability to find the right place to be in allowed us to end the match well . we were in a crisis and now i hope that this result has put an end to the crisis .

jillette : @placeholder is a great leader who fires people up , gets them to do what he wants	@entity11	editor 's note : @entity2 -- the larger , louder half of @entity4 -- is a magician , comedian , actor , author and producer . @entity11 and @entity12 both promise a government that will watch over us ... " i do n't like that , " says @entity2 . ( @entity15 ) -- everyone i talk to seems to think the president of the @entity19 right now is stupid . the @entity21 presidency is stupid speeches , stupid high gas prices , stupid bad economy , stupid war on terrorism , stupid war on drugs , stupid hurricane fixing , stupid global warming , stupid war -- stupid , stupid , stupid . they all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the @entity35 fast , and @entity21 is so stupid , that task should n't be too hard . not me . i 'd like to say that i believe every president in @entity19 history , including the stupid one we have now , is smarter than me . my alma mater is @entity41 and @entity42 on @entity43 , so i 'm damning with faint praise , but i 'm stupider than this here stupid president . maybe i 'm less stupider than @entity21 than i 'm stupider than @entity46 . but i 'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together . the idea , especially from the @entity50 that i know , is , we just get a smarter guy in the @entity35 , and all the problems will go away . we 'll have smart speeches , smart high gas prices , smart bad economy , smart war on terrorism , smart war on drugs , smart hurricanes , smart global warming , smart war in @entity64 -- smart , smart , smart . @entity11 is way smarter than @entity21 -- so way , way smarter than me . @entity11 is way more charismatic than me . he did his big speech for about 80,000 people ; i 'll do my show tonight in @entity69 for about 1,000 people . he 's more ambitious than @entity71 ; he 's going to be the next president of the @entity19 , and i could n't even get to week three of " @entity73 . " @entity11 is a great leader . he can fire people up and get them to do what he wants . he does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be . but i do n't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing . i 'm worried about someone smarter than @entity21 taking over that tremendous power . @entity88 and ambition increase my fear exponentially , and a great leader scares me to death . we need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the @entity19 ca n't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore should n't try . the only reason @entity12 scares me a little less is because i think he 's a little less likely to win . they both promise a government that will watch over us , and i do n't like that . i do n't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me . i may be stupid , but i want a chance to try to be a grown - up and take care of my family . @entity109 means the freedom to be stupid , and that 's what i want . i do n't want anyone to feel my pain or tell me to ask what we can do for our country , or give us all money and take care of us . @entity119 at the @entity120 explains that the @entity121 wanted the president " to faithfully execute the laws , defend the country from attack and check @entity126 with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds . " that sounds like plenty to me . you got ta be smarter than me to do all that , but you do n't have to be as smart as @entity11 , and you sure do n't have to be a great leader . our first seven presidents averaged a bit more than three public speeches a year , and they did n't promise jobs for everyone , day care , dental exams and free stuff . it 's really hard to find someone who trusts @entity19 to take care of themselves and each other without government force . it 's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what @entity151 humbly called the " chief magistrate . " i think @entity154 and @entity155 mean it when they say they want much smaller government . but the government is already big enough , powerful enough and bipartisan enough ( and " bi " means exactly two and no more ) that @entity154 and / or @entity155 wo n't even be in the debates . people wo n't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves . the choice should n't be which lesser of two evils should have the enormous power of our modern presidents . the question should be , who would do less as president ? who would leave us alone ? if we could find a lazier , less charismatic , stupider person than me to be president , i 'd be all for it . but , it 's not going to be easy ; stupider than me is rare breed . so remember , the only way to waste your vote is to vote ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .	@entity21:Bush	@entity88:Charisma	@entity151:George Washington	@entity155:Bob Barr	@entity154:Ron Paul	@entity2:Jillette	@entity4:Penn & Teller	@entity50:Democrats	@entity119:Gene Healy	@entity71:I	@entity73:Dancing with the Stars	@entity15:CNN	@entity35:White House	@entity12:McCain	@entity11:Obama	@entity69:Vegas	@entity19:Americans	@entity126:Congress	@entity109:Freedom	@entity120:Cato Institute	@entity121:Founding Fathers	@entity46:Jefferson	@entity41:Ringling Bros.	@entity42:Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show	@entity43:Earth Clown College	@entity64:Georgia
a @placeholder alderman says @entity4 's president contradicts what executives told him	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 alderman says @entity4 's president is publicly contradicting what company executives personally assured him for months -- that the fast - food chain is changing its stance on gay marriage -- and he asked the company sunday to clarify . alderman @entity11 made news last week when he announced @entity4 has ceased making donations to anti-gay groups and has enacted workplace protections for its employees against discrimination . @entity11 said the two concessions were the result of 10 months of negotiations he had with @entity4 executives as he weighed whether to support a new @entity23 in his @entity2 ward . he said the executives gave him documents backing up the new positions . how the @entity4 controversy evolved @entity4 , in a statement thursday , affirmed the workplace protections . friday , however , company president @entity31 denied the company has ceased making donations to groups that oppose gay marriage and said @entity4 " made no such concessions . " " there continues to be erroneous implications in the media that @entity4 changed our practices and priorities in order to obtain permission for a new restaurant in @entity2 , " @entity38 said in a statement to @entity40 , the former @entity41 presidential candidate who now runs a conservative website . " that is incorrect . " @entity11 said sunday that @entity38 's statement " at the least , muddied the progress we had made with @entity4 and , at the worst , contradicted the documents and promises @entity4 made to me and the community earlier this month . " @entity11 said @entity4 executives gave him a letter earlier this year saying the company 's non-profit arm , the @entity59 , will not support organizations with political agendas . " we were told that these organizations included groups that politically work against the rights of gay and lesbian people , " @entity11 said . he said the executives confirmed to him that both the foundation and the company in 2012 has not given money and will not give money to those groups . @entity38 's conflicting statement , @entity11 said sunday , is " disturbing . " " i am simply asking mr. @entity31 to confirm statements and documents that his company executives provided to me , " @entity11 said in a written statement , capitalizing " his " for emphasis . chicken , with a side of politics " it 's pretty simple , mr. @entity31 . do you acknowledge and support the policies that your executives outlined to me in writing or do you not ? yes or no ? " the statement added . @entity4 , whose restaurants are closed on sundays , did not immediately respond to a request for comment . while the company has never hidden its conservative principles , @entity38 caused an uproar in july when , in an interview with the @entity98 , he said the company supports " the biblical definition of the family unit . " the interview brought attention to donations the company made to organizations some activists said were anti-gay . gay rights activists and others denounced the company and promised a boycott , while others vowed to support the company . @entity40 suggested a " @entity112 " and thousands turned out to show their support . @entity11 said sunday he has yet to introduce legislation for the new @entity4 - a restaurant in his ward and will wait for @entity38 's response before moving forward . @entity117 : ' i 'm gay and i support @entity4 ' opinion : @entity4 and free speech gay rights activists hold ' kiss day ' at @entity4 restaurants @entity0 's @entity124 contributed to this report .	@entity31:Dan Cathy	@entity2:Chicago	@entity0:CNN	@entity11:Moreno	@entity23:Chick-fil-A restaurant	@entity38:Cathy	@entity4:Chick-fil-A	@entity117:iReport	@entity40:Huckabee	@entity41:Republican	@entity98:Baptist Press	@entity124:John Murgatroyd	@entity137:Company	@entity59:WinShape Foundation	@entity112:Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day
@entity64 defeat puts pressure on @entity66 in @placeholder	@entity63	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 international @entity1 scored both goals for @entity4 in their 2 - 0 win over @entity6 , on sunday , but the @entity8 giants remain four points behind @entity11 leaders @entity12 , who defeated @entity14 3 - 1 . @entity1 , who was angry to be substituted in @entity4 's @entity16 defeat by @entity17 in midweek , opened the scoring with a superb 36th - minute individual goal , deftly flicking the ball away from keeper @entity21 before rolling the ball into an empty net . and he sealed the points for the home side 10 minutes after the break , slotting the ball home after a one - two with @entity4 teammate @entity29 . but , despite the victory , champions @entity12 are still the side in pole position in the @entity34 title race after they saw off @entity14 in front of a remarkable crowd of over 80,000 supporters . @entity39 striker @entity38 was their match - winner , with a double strike of his own to give @entity12 a seventh straight win and sixth in the @entity11 . the 23 - year - old opened the scoring in the 27th minute and doubled his tally early in the second half from close range after being set up by compatriot @entity48 . a superb long - range strike from @entity51 striker @entity50 , who spotted @entity12 keeper @entity52 well off his line , gave the visitors some hope . but subsitute @entity56 secured the points for @entity12 with a decisive third goal in injury time . meanwhile , in @entity63 's @entity62 , in - form @entity61 beat @entity64 1 - 0 to pile the pressure on @entity64 coach @entity66 after a seventh defeat in eight matches . @entity70 's second - half strike settled the match at the @entity72 to lift @entity61 to 40 points and fifth place while @entity64 remain in seventh on 36 points . @entity61 , who beat @entity77 in midweek in the @entity16 , could even play the last 12 minutes with 10 men after @entity79 's sending off . @entity66 told @entity63 television after the defeat that his future was in doubt . " i do n't know what the president ( @entity84 ) will do now . this is a question for him . i would say @entity66 should continue . i still believe in these players , " he said .	@entity21:Timo Hildebrand	@entity29:Thomas Muller	@entity84:Massimo Moratti	@entity12:Dortmund	@entity2:French	@entity1:Franck Ribery	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Schalke	@entity4:Bayern	@entity8:Bavarian	@entity52:Roman Weidenfeller	@entity51:Ivory Coast	@entity50:Didier Ya Konan	@entity79:Salvatore Aronica	@entity56:Ivan Perisic	@entity77:Chelsea	@entity70:Ezequiel Lavezzi	@entity72:San Paolo	@entity17:Basel	@entity16:Champions League	@entity14:Hanover	@entity34:German	@entity11:Bundesliga	@entity39:Poland	@entity38:Robert Lewandowski	@entity48:Jakub Blaszczykowski	@entity66:Claudio Ranieri	@entity64:Inter	@entity62:Serie A	@entity63:Italy	@entity61:Napoli
@entity33 says there is no proof that the steroid tests were from @placeholder	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- baseball all - time home run champion @entity2 won a big legal victory friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court . the @entity12 - based 9th @entity11 , in a divided opinion , said the government can not use urine samples and other evidence in its perjury case against the former @entity17 star . @entity2 was indicted in federal court in december 2008 on 10 counts of making false statements to a grand jury -- specifically , denying that he knowingly took steroids and other performance - enhancing drugs . his criminal trial has been delayed while the legal issues are being worked out . it was unclear whether the @entity27 will now appeal to the @entity28 in an effort to allow the evidence to be used in court . the @entity33 ruling upholds a february 2009 ruling from @entity36 district judge @entity35 that there was no proof that positive steroid tests from 2000 and 2001 were @entity2 ' and that out - of - court statements from his former trainer , @entity41 , are hearsay . the appeals court majority said the repeated refusal of @entity41 to testify against @entity2 means evidence allegedly gathered by him is considered " inadmissible , since he would be unable to vouch for its authenticity . " @entity51 , a professor at the @entity52 said the ruling essentially torpedoes the prosecution 's case , which was heavily dependent on evidence and information from @entity2 ' former trainer . " there was a link missing here , that the only way to get down to the nitty - gritty that this was from @entity2 was using hearsay testimony , " @entity51 said . @entity41 , he said , " had possession of the evidence and he had that knowledge , and you ca n't use that knowledge unless he actually testifies under oath . " " to try and prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt , particularly in @entity12 where there are going to be many , many people chosen for a jury who would be behind @entity2 -- it should be the death knell , " @entity51 said . " practically speaking they should say , ' we gave it our best shot , and it 's just not there , ' " he said . @entity41 allegedly took urine samples and delivered them to a bay - area lab known as @entity88 . at issue in the appeal was whether the tested samples actually came from @entity92 , and @entity41 's employment status at the time . the appeals court concluded @entity41 was an " independent contractor " -- not directly hired by @entity92 . because @entity2 also did not control the samples , the court reasoned , @entity41 would need to testify in person on the material and the chain of possession . the government said it would instead bring @entity88 executive @entity102 to the stand to testify @entity41 told him the samples indeed came from @entity92 . the court ultimately agreed with the arguments presented by @entity2 ' lawyers . " because the government was attempting to use @entity41 's out - of - court statements to prove the truth of what they contained , @entity2 argued that @entity41 's statements were inadmissible hearsay and that the lab results could not be authenticated as @entity2 ' in that manner . " @entity2 hit a record - setting 73 homers in the 2001 season . that same year , as well as before and after , the @entity116 said @entity117 recorded urine and blood tests , under the name " @entity2 , " showing " positive " results for steroids and performance - enchancing drugs . the government had the burden of showing the samples came from @entity92 , then went to @entity41 and then to @entity88 . @entity41 has refused to testify and has been jailed for contempt of court on several occasions . " there must be at least some manifestation of assent to the principal 's right to control , " said the court of @entity92 . " here , the testing was performed on @entity41 's own initiative and not at the request of @entity2 . the dissent incorrectly assumes otherwise . thus , the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that @entity41 was not an agent for the limited purpose of the drug testing . " the government alleges @entity88 helped supply bonds with steroids and drug - masking substances . @entity88 was accused of covertly marketing tetrahydrogestrinone -- known as " the @entity149 " -- a then - undetectable performance - enhancing steroid . @entity153 founder @entity152 and associates such as @entity41 allegedly supplied other top athletes with the @entity149 and human growth hormone , assuring the competitors they would not be caught cheating . the lab performed repeated tests on athletes , said the government , to check whether the drugs were detectable . top professional football and track stars were caught up in the scandal , prosecutors say . steroid use was banned by @entity168 in 2003 . neither the government nor @entity2 had an immediate reaction to the ruling . in light of the decision , it remains unclear whether the criminal trail will proceed . the case is @entity36 v. @entity2 ( 09 - 10079 ) . @entity1 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .	@entity27:Justice Department	@entity28:Supreme Court	@entity117:BALCO Laboratories	@entity116:FBI	@entity88:BALCO	@entity152:Victor Conte	@entity2:Bonds	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity177:Augie Martin	@entity178:Matt Cherry	@entity153:Company	@entity52:University of San Francisco School of Law	@entity51:Talbot	@entity17:San Francisco Giants	@entity33:Appeals Court	@entity35:Susan Illston	@entity12:San Francisco	@entity11:Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals	@entity36:U.S.	@entity102:James Valente	@entity92:Bonds	@entity168:Major League Baseball	@entity149:Clear	@entity41:Anderson
pair named @placeholder and @entity11 recently joined by two eaglets	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- eagles may be thin on the ground for most golfers at the @entity5 course at @entity6 . but up in the treetops , it 's a different matter . bald eagles @entity10 and @entity11 have been par for the course at the @entity14 club for the past three and a half years , scoring highly with both local and global audiences thanks to a camera installed by their nest in a pine tree behind the 10th green . " the eagles came in and started building a nest in december 2010 , " explains golf course superintendent @entity21 . " the first year they had two eaglets and both fledged successfully . we were just watching them from the ground not really knowing what was going on until about mid-may when two black heads popped up out of the nest . " the discovery prompted @entity21 to install an @entity34 which has been live since early 2012 . this year , the pair -- who were given their names by @entity21 's daughter -- welcomed two more eaglets who go by the more functional names of @entity42 and @entity43 . bald eagles were once on the @entity46 endangered species list , but numbers of the nation 's symbol have risen since the government banned the pesticide ddt -- which contaminated the birds ' food sources . the wingspans of the female eagles , which are larger than the males , can be up to eight feet . " @entity14 has had some good success with its eagle population , but this is the only one on a golf course that i know of . we are trying to show that golf courses can be a sustainable habitat for wildlife , " @entity21 told @entity0 ahead of @entity61 -- an initiative started in 1970 aimed at improving the world 's environment , and marked globally this year on april 22 . @entity5 's round - the - clock live feed has received almost a million views to date . the virtual presence has also helped business at the club . " i 've been in the pro shop several times and people come in and ask which hole @entity34 is on , " @entity21 says . " we 've definitely had a considerable amount of play off it . " the project is one of many environmentally - minded measures @entity21 and his colleagues have tended to in recent years . " it 's not just about how we mow the grass or what fertilizer we 're putting down . we have an education center which has environmental information , awards and pictures of the course , " he says . @entity21 , who also writes about environmental improvements on a blog and gives talks , was recently recognized for his green leadership . last november , @entity98 awarded the course its @entity100 and in february @entity21 was crowned overall winner of the @entity102 in @entity103 for 2013 . the prestigious prize , which is open to golf courses around the world , is jointly run by the @entity107 and @entity98 . historically , golf courses have n't attracted praise for their green credentials but rather criticism , often being held up as examples of resource profligacy for over-watering and widespread use of chemicals . but this view may now be outdated says @entity117 , curators professor of biological sciences at the @entity119 . " golf courses are aware of some of these negative things and actually they have done a very good job over the last 10 - 20 years of trying to improve environmental practices , " says @entity117 , who recently led a study on the effects of golf course development on salamander populations in the southern @entity124 . " we studied 10 golf courses interviewing golf superintendents and managers . these were young , highly educated people -- many had degrees in biology , turf science or wildlife management . " they are well aware of these problems and very excited and very willing to make changes and use environmentally sound practices . " @entity21 says things have shifted " 180 degrees " since 2001 when he started at @entity5 , a @entity145 - designed course -- noting that the club has substantially reduced mowing , fertilizer use and water consumption . " we 've removed over 50 acres of highly maintained earth in the last decade . when you figure that out from a water standpoint , we save 7.39 million gallons annually . " as individuals and organizations around the globe mark @entity61 , it 's good to know that people like @entity21 are keeping an eagle eye on the environment not just today but all - year - round . read more : how many more majors can @entity163 win ? read more : hornet attack ' my scariest moment '	@entity21:Carter	@entity163:Bubba	@entity107:Golf Course Superintendents Association of America	@entity117:Semlitsch	@entity119:University of Missouri	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Harrison Bay	@entity5:Bear Trace	@entity14:Tennessee	@entity34:Eagle Cam	@entity11:Eloise	@entity10:Elliott	@entity100:Green Star Award	@entity102:Environmental Leaders	@entity103:Golf Award	@entity98:Golf Digest	@entity124:Appalachians	@entity145:Jack Nicklaus	@entity46:U.S.	@entity42:HB5	@entity43:HB6	@entity61:Earth Day

@placeholder beat @entity3 by nine wickets in second test in @entity10	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 inflicted the first home series defeat on @entity3 in almost 16 years as they wrapped up a nine - wicket win over the world 's number one ranked @entity9 nation in @entity10 on tuesday . @entity12 captain @entity11 led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory . captain @entity11 hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the @entity19 to take an unassailable 2 - 0 lead . it was the @entity12 's first - ever @entity22 triumph in @entity3 and victory in the third and final match in @entity25 will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings . @entity30 ( 30 not out ) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as @entity1 became the first team to overcome @entity3 at home since the @entity35 in 1992 - 93 . @entity1 were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational @entity11 was trapped leg before wicket by @entity43 . @entity11 had dominated a 121 - run opening stand with @entity45 , hitting 10 boundaries . @entity47 struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from @entity49 , who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the @entity9 . @entity1 's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden @entity9 century from @entity53 , who shared a stunning 180 - run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler @entity55 . it gave the tourists a priceless 65 - run lead on first innings before man of the match @entity55 worked his magic with the ball as @entity3 were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings . the pugnacious @entity11 was virtually lost for words in his victory speech .

@placeholder playground cost more than $ 7 million ; he 's seeking $ 5 million more to sustain it	@entity36	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- he 's designed everything from upscale hotels and restaurants to the sets for @entity8 plays and the @entity10 ceremony . so you might think that creating a kids ' playground would n't appeal to world - renowned architect @entity14 . but it did . @entity14 , a father of two , became frustrated when he took his kids to traditional playgrounds . he found that these play areas lacked creativity . " traditional playgrounds are geared toward gross motor skills and linear play ... they are largely made of fixed equipment : seesaws , slides , monkey bars , swings , " @entity14 said . " they are fantastic places to build gross motor skills . " so he decided to design a playground that focused on building imagination by letting the kids build the playground themselves . the first of his @entity35 opened in july in lower @entity36 . " [ @entity37 ] is a totally manipulatable playground in which every part of it allows kids to create their own constantly transformable play escape . " visiting the playground in lower @entity36 is an adventure . it 's not every day , as a @entity1 reporter , i get to cross over a moat and dodge pipes and water noodles while getting doused with the occasional water splash . in a world of endless standardized tests and regimented schedules , @entity14 's playground is meant to encourage creative thinking , teamwork and risk taking . at first , it looks like a regular playground , but look closer , and there are no swings or monkey bars . instead , there 's water , real sand , big blue foam pieces in many different shapes , shovels , wheelbarrows , balls and lots of running space . kids have to work together here : two boys are dragging foam pieces from the sand to the water , while another group stacks them . when i ask why they 're doing all this work , they say , " to close the hole in our bridge . " most of the groups of kids have just met each other in the playground on this very day . @entity87 , 10 , stopped and pointed to a shapeless stack of blue foam wedges . " see , that 's a boat you can float on , " she said . " i was actually kind of helping make it . " she says she just met the kids who helped her build it in the park today . we spoke with @entity14 in the playground as two kids pushed past us with a wheelbarrow filled with foam blocks , while others built what @entity14 guessed was " a raft city . " @entity104 , he described it as " a humbling experience for a control freak architect . " " one hundred percent of the time , the kids do not use the objects in the way i designed them to be used , " he said . @entity14 likes to visit the playground to see what new ideas kids have developed for his foam pieces . " we 're finding that kids are so over-programmed and have so little free time that when they get here , their own little creative potential is unleashed , " he said . it took him more than five years to build @entity37 , and he did n't do it alone . he consulted with play experts and conducted focus groups watching kids use prototypes of the foam . @entity125 , one of the play experts who worked with @entity14 on @entity37 , would like to see more playgrounds like it . " it 's all about avoiding risk in most playgrounds , so it 's been dumbed down and there 's less and less kids can do , " @entity130 explained . this one is different because " everything can be invented , reinvented , and this is critical for how kids learn . this enables kids to make their own decisions , to see cause and effect by building up , destroying , building again , " she said . but building more playgrounds like this one wo n't be cheap : @entity14 donated his time and design expertise and helped raise money for the project . the @entity151 donated $ 4.4 million , and the city of @entity0 threw in an additional $ 3 million to get the underground pipes in working order . @entity130 believes these kinds of play experiences help prepare kids for environments where not everything is controlled . " here , nothing is fixed , nothing is predetermined , and they can see consequences , learn to make decisions , " @entity130 said . " they learn that not everything is already laid out for you in a way in which it 's always going to be perfect : it 's possible to fail . " @entity170 brought her daughter to the park for the first time while we were there . " i love it , " she said as she watched her daughter help another little girl carry a large white pipe across the playground . " she just seems to be creating things and interacting with younger and older kids . it 's been a great experience so far . " @entity14 is trying to raise a $ 5 million endowment to sustain the playground , which has some atypical costs , including replacing the foam pieces and paying for two " play assistants " who oversee the kids . @entity14 is also exporting the idea to other cities . he 's made portable versions of the playground , which he calls " @entity194 " -- each contains the foam pieces and other loose parts . @entity14 says they 're now in some parks and children 's museums around the country . they cost between $ 7,600 and $ 11,700 . he does n't make money off this project . he says he does it because he believes it makes a difference , and he 'd like to build more full - scale @entity209 in other cities around the country . @entity14 smiled as we watched two girls try to dam up a waterspout . " i love working for these constituents , " he said . " they are my most interesting clients .

@entity7 worker @entity67 has @entity116 in @placeholder history	@entity71	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- it is twilight at @entity4 , and a small army of @entity7 workers has gathered in the vast empty parking lot . their mission this spring evening is to find and count the tens of thousands of homeless people who call @entity0 home . @entity13 is one of the newly minted census workers who will be hitting the streets and gathering information . she will be helping the homeless men and women living on skid row and in shelters to fill out their census forms . not everyone she meets will be agreeable , but @entity23 says she does n't mind . " i am very happy to have this job , " said the 28 - year - old @entity0 native . " i come from a great background , " she said . " i have a good r√©sum√© and a good education . " but in the current economic climate , that did n't translate into a job . @entity13 has been unemployed for the past two years , one of the millions affected by the recession . the nation 's unemployment rate still stands at 9.7 percent after some modest job gains this year . the economy shed 8.4 million jobs from march 2008 to april 2009 . but it has actually been a boon to the people responsible for compiling the 2010 census . the @entity41 is hiring 1.2 million people to gather information for its once - a - decade headcount of the @entity46 population . " we have noticed , with the economy the way it is , the caliber of person we have recruited for this census is remarkably better than we have seen in the past , " said @entity47 , director of operations for the the @entity46 census ' @entity48 . @entity57 believes that this year 's highly educated work force could make this census the most accurate in history . " we have people with advanced degrees working as census - takers , " he said . " they may be overqualified , but they are glad to be working .

" i like to say that i am called to serve , " @entity67 said . " that is my calling . " but her census job will end june 1 . nevertheless , she believes the experience has prepared her to move forward . " i 'm being groomed : how to handle the community , how to handle negotiations , how to handle dignitaries , " she said . " this has been a lesson . a big lesson . " it 's a lesson that @entity67 hopes will translate into employment in politics or the diplomatic field . @entity67 's census job has lasted about 18 months , but most of the 1.2 million census jobs will last only a few weeks . even though the employment is short term , @entity13 sums up the attitude of most of these temporary employees : " i 'm highly appreciative of every hour i am working and every paycheck .

families of slaying victims @entity28 and @placeholder filed a civil lawsuit	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- the families of two men allegedly gunned down by @entity3 won a partial victory tuesday when a judge ruled that $ 5 million in assets from his home can be frozen pending the outcome of his double - murder trial and their lawsuit . the ruling preserves their right to possible collection of money in the future . the families are happy with the decision , an attorney said . " they 're gratified that the judge acknowledged the level of their loss by allowing the $ 5 million attachment , " civil attorney @entity19 told @entity0 . however , the ruling also means the families of @entity28 and @entity29 ca n't automatically lay claim to an estimated $ 3.3 million @entity3 claims he 's still owed by his old @entity32 team if the @entity33 should pay him . prosecutors charge that in july 2012 , @entity3 fired a .38 - caliber gun into the victims ' car after @entity29 accidentally bumped into @entity3 , causing him to spill his drink . the suspected murder weapon has been recovered . @entity3 has pleaded not guilty . the @entity33 are locked in a salary dispute with the @entity41 , which is reportedly taking @entity3 ' position . in court testimony , the @entity33 have taken the position they do n't owe @entity3 any more money . the @entity33 have declined comment to @entity0 on the matter . the organization has stipulated it would notify the court if it intends to pay @entity3 any additional money . " the reality is the $ 3.3 million , that right to be paid , is probably the only money my ( clients ) will ever be able to see , " @entity19 pleaded in a hearing last week before the judge . however , the court 's written ruling also means the @entity60 and @entity29 families can pursue the @entity33 to try to learn more about @entity3 ' contract , including what he was paid and what he may be owed . in a separate civil lawsuit filed before the @entity68 case , the family of slaying victim @entity65 also has a court attachment on @entity3 's home pending the outcome of the murder charge against @entity3 filed in june 2013 . " from their vantage point , all they can do from the civil perspective is to hold him ( @entity3 ) accountable civilly , " @entity19 added . " none of this will bring back their loved ones , they 'll still have a loss . ... but the family has started this procedure to hold him civilly liable and they 're doing that , " he said . according to authorities , @entity3 paid just over $ 1 million for the home when he joined the @entity33 in 2007 . the family seeks to be paid up to $ 5 million each in value from the home in @entity91 , @entity92 . judge approves @entity3 jail move the case against @entity3 : where 's the weapon ?	@entity3:Hernandez	@entity33:Patriots	@entity0:CNN	@entity28:Furtado	@entity29:Abreu	@entity19:Kennedy	@entity32:NFL	@entity41:NFL Players Association	@entity68:Boston	@entity60:Furtado	@entity65:Odin Lloyd	@entity92:Massachusetts	@entity91:North Attleborough
@entity159 : " he thought he 'd end up in heaven , " the prosecutor says of @placeholder	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the judge in the federal trial of alleged " underwear bomber " @entity2 refused tuesday to prevent the prosecution from calling the device he allegedly carried a " bomb . " @entity10 district judge @entity9 also refused to exclude a photo of @entity2 's burned genitals from the evidence . before the prosecution began its opening statement , defense standby counsel @entity16 asked that the prosecutors not be allowed to use the words " explosive device " or " bomb " during the trial . it 's up to the jury to decide whether the device @entity2 was carrying was a bomb , @entity24 argued . " i 'm going to deny that motion , " responded @entity9 . " it makes no sense whatsoever . " as for the photo , the judge said it did not seem " unusually prejudicial . " @entity2 , accused of trying to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a @entity38 2009 flight to @entity0 , has said he will represent himself . the prosecution delivered a 90 - minute opening statement . the defense said it would reserve the right to give an opening statement at a later point in the trial in the @entity46 . at one point , @entity2 joined the attorneys for a sidebar with the judge . while at previous court appearances @entity2 has had outbursts -- including yelling " @entity54 's alive , " a reference to @entity54 , according to a court official -- he remained calm tuesday . @entity2 wore a traditional @entity57 gown , gray with gold - colored braiding . @entity2 was indicted on charges including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism , and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence . he has pleaded not guilty to the charges . he was a passenger on @entity73 en route from the @entity75 to @entity0 on christmas day 2009 . @entity10 officials say the terror group @entity77 was behind the alleged bombing attempt . @entity79 , chief of the @entity80 for the @entity81 in the @entity82 of @entity83 , laid out details of the flight in his opening statement . passengers were from 26 different countries , most of them @entity10 and @entity75 , he said . " everyone had someplace to be . all but one . " pointing to @entity2 , @entity79 said , " his sole reason for being on @entity73 was to kill all of the passengers and himself . he thought he 'd end up in heaven . " after taking numerous trips to the bathroom , @entity2 went back to the bathroom about an hour before the plane was to land , " to purify himself to die , " @entity79 said . @entity2 did not eat or drink on the plane , a fast that was part of ritual purification , @entity79 said . a witness testified that @entity2 was in the bathroom for about 15 to 20 minutes , which seemed long to the passenger , @entity79 said . when @entity2 returned to his seat , he pulled a blanket over his head , " pushed the plunger on the bomb and prepared to die , " @entity79 said . passengers heard a loud noise , which sounded like a firecracker , @entity79 said . @entity2 became enveloped in a fireball which then spread to the wall and carpeting of the plane , yet he remained in his seat " expressionless , completely blank , " @entity79 said . four passengers helped subdue him and tried to put out the fire , @entity79 said , and @entity2 was escorted up to first class . when a flight attendant asked him what he had in his pockets , he called it " an explosive device , " @entity79 said . @entity79 added that @entity2 was very verbal and spoke with many people , including some on the flight and officials once the flight landed . the prosecution also called its first witness tuesday , @entity135 , who was on the flight one row behind @entity2 . @entity135 , a 20 - year veteran of the @entity138 , was among those who tried to restrain the defendant . within a minute of the loud sound on the plane , a passenger said to @entity2 , " hey man , your pants are on fire ! " @entity135 testified . the passenger repeated himself two or three times , and @entity2 did not respond , @entity135 said . the jury is made up of three white men and nine women -- six white , two african - american and one @entity153 . @entity1 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .	@entity24:Chambers	@entity80:National Security Unit	@entity81:U.S. Attorney 's Office	@entity82:Eastern District	@entity83:Michigan	@entity138:Army	@entity135:Zantow	@entity155:Laura Dolan	@entity154:Deborah Feyerick	@entity2:AbdulMutallab	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Detroit	@entity9:Edmunds	@entity57:African	@entity54:Osama bin Laden	@entity75:Dutch	@entity79:Tukel	@entity77:al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula	@entity153:Southeast Asian	@entity73:Flight 253	@entity16:Anthony Chambers	@entity10:American	@entity38:Christmas	@entity159:NEW	@entity46:U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan

" it is still their responsibility to maintain the ceasefire , " he said . deadly clashes erupted again at the border earlier this month . the disputed area is the site of @entity41 , a 900 - year - old @entity42 . in 1962 , an international court awarded the temple to @entity7 , but @entity8 claims that the area around the temple has not been clearly demarcated . the two countries have been in a stand - off since 2008 , when @entity49 granted @entity50 . since the renewed fighting , @entity4 has sent @entity23 to meet with leaders of both @entity8 and @entity7 to try to ease tensions . the @entity54 has also called for a permanent cease - fire and backed @entity4 's efforts to mediate . on tuesday , @entity23 said @entity4 is stepping up to the plate and is " waging peace aggressively " . he expressed hope they can send off the observers to the border " sooner rather than later .

the grandson of the @placeholder character in the movie has the real @entity18 's papers	@entity21	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- there were always three pictures of @entity4 on the mantelpiece of the various houses @entity7 lived in when he was growing up -- including one signed and dated by the king on the day of his coronation -- but as a boy in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity7 does n't remember wondering why . only years later , after his father died and @entity7 inherited a box of papers and scrapbooks , did it all begin to make sense . @entity7 's grandfather was @entity18 , the @entity20 speech therapist played by @entity21 in the @entity23 nominated movie " @entity24 . " @entity7 -- born 12 years after his grandfather died -- had inherited some archive : @entity28 cards from the king and queen , a condolence card from @entity4 to @entity18 when his wife died , and a letter of thanks from the queen for a letter @entity7 wrote when the king himself died several years later . the papers also include hundreds of letters exchanged by the king and the speech therapist , whom he met more than a decade before he was crowned . " the content of the letters between them is incredibly friendly as you 'd expect between two friends , " @entity7 says . " but there is a kind of etiquette that @entity18 still abides by , " addressing @entity4 as " your @entity51 . " @entity4 addressed his friend as " @entity54 , " and signed the early letters " @entity56 " -- his name before he was crowned king . the later letters are signed " @entity4 . " also among his grandfather 's papers is what @entity7 believes is the actual copy of the speech @entity4 read at the outbreak of war with @entity67 1939 -- the climactic scene of the movie . " in this grave hour , perhaps the most fateful in our history ... " the speech begins . the copy in @entity7 's archive contains handwritten pencil notes , indicating what words to stress and where to pause . " @entity24 " condenses the friendship of the monarch and commoner into about a year , but the real @entity4 and @entity7 knew each other for a quarter of a century . " the first thing that i came across that startled me was his appointment card , " @entity7 says . in tiny handwriting , @entity7 assessed his new patient , @entity56 , @entity87 in 1926 . the duke " has acute nervous tension which has been brought on by the defect . he is of nervous disposition ... contracts teeth and mouth and mechanically closes throat ... an extraordinary habit of clipping small words - an , in , on - and saying the first syllable of one word and the last syllable of another , " @entity7 wrote . the @entity87 saw @entity7 almost every day for next two or three months , in advance of a royal visit to @entity20 , @entity7 's records show . the friendship lasted for the rest of their lives , although it seems they were never photographed together . at the @entity109 in 1937 , @entity7 is seated in the royal box , with his wife , @entity111 . they are so high up , she 's using opera glasses . @entity111 died suddenly of a heart attack after @entity116 , prompting the king to write : " @entity54 , i must send you one line to tell you how terribly sorry i was to hear of your bereavement . and i send you all my deepest sympathy in your great grief ... i do so feel for you as i know you had a perfect companionship with her . i am yours sincerely . @entity4 . " @entity7 gets choked up reading the letter generations later . " it 's something about thinking about him hurting after @entity111 's death ... makes it kind of real , " he says . the archive inspired him to write a book with the author @entity132 . " @entity24 " director @entity133 starting looking at @entity7 's material about seven weeks before starting filming , @entity7 says -- and was able to add some details to the movie as a result . @entity133 had n't known , for example , that the king took off his jacket and stood to deliver the 1939 speech , since photos of the event show him seated and in full military uniform . and , from @entity7 's diary , a joke was added . " i went to @entity148 on sunday for the broadcast ... only one mistake ... w in weapons , " @entity7 wrote .

@placeholder says he did not intend to harm anyone	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- anti-whaling activist @entity1 was given a two - year suspended prison sentence and five years ' probation wednesday by a @entity5 district court judge for his role in boarding a @entity8 whaling ship . @entity1 was found guilty on five charges , ranging from assault against whalers to trespassing into a whaling vessel . @entity1 had previously pleaded guilty to all charges but assault . he could have received up to 15 years behind bars on charges . @entity1 testified during his trial in may that he had no intention of hurting anyone when he protested @entity8 's whale hunt . the @entity21 activist from the @entity22 said that he believed the bottles of butyric acid he threw at the @entity26 whaling ship were non-toxic and would not harm anyone . prosecutors said the butyric acid burned two crew members of the @entity8 whaling fleet , but @entity22 called it a harmless , albeit rancid , liquid . @entity35 acid is found in rancid butter and vomit . at the may hearing , he tearfully described the january collision between the @entity26 2 and the @entity22 's multi-million - dollar speedboat , the @entity42 . the crash sunk the @entity42 , which @entity1 captained . weeks later , @entity1 jumped aboard the @entity26 2 and attempted to make a citizen 's arrest of the captain . he was arrested and brought back to @entity8 to face criminal charges . " i admit that i boarded the @entity26 , but i believe that i have good reason to do so , " he said . " i admit that i fired the butyric acid . " @entity1 's case is the first time a @entity22 activist has been tried in a @entity8 criminal court in the group 's long - running battle with @entity8 's whalers in the icy waters of the @entity58 .

@placeholder headed @entity80 , helped shape @entity1 's future	@entity16	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- one of @entity1 's top @entity4 leaders died wednesday after a lengthy battle with lung cancer , a senior official with his office told @entity2 . @entity1 @entity4 leader @entity9 , seen in a 2007 photo , was an ally of both the @entity11 and @entity12 . @entity9 , who was born in 1950 , died in @entity13 , @entity12 , where he had been receiving treatment for more than two years , according to his adviser @entity15 . @entity16 had recently suffered a medical setback , according to his party , which asked people to pray for him in a statement released on sunday . his body will be sent to @entity1 and he will be buried in his hometown of @entity23 , one of the holiest cities for @entity4 , @entity15 said . @entity11 ambassador to @entity1 @entity27 and the top @entity11 commander in @entity1 , gen. @entity28 , issued a joint statement expressing sadness over @entity9 's death and describing him as " a national leader . " " throughout his life , his eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude , contributing to the building of a new @entity1 , " the statement said . " we offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues . " watch how @entity9 helped shape @entity1 's future ¬ª @entity1 prime minister @entity44 also offered his condolences , saying @entity9 was " like an old brother . " @entity44 credited him for being a " strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new @entity1 . " " his death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for @entity1 , " @entity44 said in the statement . @entity16 ended his more than 20 - year exile in @entity12 in 2003 , when he returned to @entity1 after @entity11 - led forces toppled @entity1 president @entity59 and his regime . " it was very emotional for me to meet with my people after @entity59 fell , " @entity9 said in a 2006 interview . " i was longing to see them . my goal in this life is to serve those great people and i am very proud to be a part of them . " @entity1 @entity4 were suppressed under the @entity59 regime , which favored the country 's minority @entity73 . @entity16 played a central role in shaping @entity1 's future following his return . during his exile , which began in the early 1980s , @entity9 commanded the @entity78 , the military wing of the @entity80 . @entity80 -- a religious movement that opposed the @entity59 regime -- was led by @entity9 's brother until he was assassinated in august 2003 . @entity16 himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts . he took over as the head of @entity80 and began his ascent to power as the @entity78 became the bulk of the @entity1 security forces in @entity1 's predominantly @entity4 south . @entity80 changed its name to the @entity80 in 2007 to remove the word " revolution , " in an effort to reflect the current situation in @entity1 . @entity16 had always propagated a message of peace , calling on @entity1 to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of @entity59 . but despite his desire for a secular democracy in @entity1 , he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion , religious institutions and its authorities . @entity16 successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like @entity112 and turned it into a powerful political platform . that ability led some to consider him @entity1 's most powerful man . his political bloc won the most seats in the @entity1 parliament in 2005 . and although @entity16 never held a government position , he commanded respect from those who did . government ministers would meet with him at his office , not theirs , and he was often seen in the company of former @entity11 ambassador to @entity1 @entity127 . and when talks on @entity1 's constitution stalled , then - president @entity128 called @entity9 , not the @entity1 prime minister or president . @entity16 visited the @entity11 three times during the @entity128 administration to address the situation in @entity1 . but he remained artfully vague about @entity12 's influence in @entity1 , saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the @entity11 government , which raised concerns about what it called @entity12 's " meddling . " he cited the two predominantly @entity4 countries ' shared border , historical and cultural relations , and emphasized the desire for strong ties . @entity16 's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in @entity1 . the power of the @entity80 party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he so proudly wanted to serve . @entity16 was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007 , and was first treated in the @entity11 , then later in @entity12 . when he returned to @entity1 later that year , he told @entity2 that he felt good . but it was around that time that it became apparent he was grooming his son , @entity156 , to take over as head of @entity80 . it was once @entity1 's most powerful @entity4 political party , but @entity80 lost much of its influence following elections in january , when politicians allied with @entity44 won control of most of @entity1 's provincial councils . @entity2 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Najaf	@entity27:Christopher Hill	@entity28:Ray Odierno	@entity80:Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq	@entity112:Ashura	@entity156:Ammar al-Hakim	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Iraq	@entity0:BAGHDAD	@entity4:Shiite	@entity9:Abdul Aziz al-Hakim	@entity78:Badr Brigades	@entity59:Saddam Hussein	@entity73:Sunni Muslims	@entity16:Al-Hakim	@entity15:al-Husseini	@entity13:Tehran	@entity12:Iran	@entity11:U.S.	@entity128:Bush	@entity127:Zalmay Khalilzad	@entity164:Jomana Karadsheh	@entity165:Mohammed Tawfeeq	@entity44:al-Maliki

the prosecution contends @placeholder fatally injured @entity15 during a fight	@entity11	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- jury selection in the trial of a @entity6 lacrosse player who is accused of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend got off to a slow start monday . many who were questioned were dismissed because they said they already knew too much about the case , were emotionally invested and did not believe they could be fair and impartial jurors . @entity11 faces charges including first - degree murder in the may 2010 death of @entity15 , a 22 - year - old senior who was also a lacrosse player . early monday , he appeared in court and pleaded not guilty . @entity19 's mother wiped away tears as the charges were read . police were initially called to @entity19 's off - campus @entity0 apartment by a roommate who reported " a possible alcohol overdose , " said police chief @entity25 at the time .

" she wanted to demonstrate she 's a responsible , good , co-parent and she did this for the sake of the child , " said a source close to @entity8 , who asked not to be identified . lawyers for both sides have not commented publicly about the case , much of which has been sealed by the judge since it involves the custody battle for their young daughter . @entity3 entered a " no contest " plea in march to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident last year involving @entity8 . a plea deal put the actor on unsupervised probation for three years and it requires @entity3 to complete 52 weeks of anger management counseling . it also allowed him to enter a no contest plea without admitting guilt . @entity3 and @entity8 are in a bitter legal fight over custody of their daughter . the sheriff 's investigation findings have been in the hands of prosecutors since august . it was not immediately clear if @entity8 would continue to pursue a civil suit against @entity3 based on the violence accusations . @entity1 's @entity55 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Gibson	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Los Angeles	@entity11:Los Angeles County Superior Court	@entity8:Grigorieva	@entity55:Jack Hannah
though kicked out of @entity18 , @placeholder does a great deal of business in @entity9	@entity6	editor 's note : @entity3 executive producer @entity2 is the author of " @entity4 : @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 . " private contractor @entity6 flies military personnel in @entity9 and helps train @entity9 border police . the company formerly known as @entity6 , now called @entity6 much to its chagrin , has been at the center of the contractor debate for years . from the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in @entity17 , @entity18 , in 2004 , to a shooting involving a team of its men in a @entity23 neighborhood in which at least 14 @entity18 civilians were killed in 2007 , the company has drawn unwanted headlines . @entity6 owner @entity5 downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment . he changed the company 's name after the @entity18 government banned it from doing business there . but those who thought contractors were going away under president @entity35 's administration could n't be more wrong . according to the @entity37 , there are some 68,000 contractors in @entity9 today and more than 132,000 in @entity18 . but those numbers are n't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they do n't include those working for other government agencies such as the @entity45 . many of those tens of thousands are third - country nationals , meaning they were hired from a third country to go to @entity18 . many earn between $ 400 and $ 700 a month ; while @entity50 , particularly those performing dangerous security duties , can earn as much in a day . despite being kicked out of @entity18 , @entity6 still does a healthy business in @entity9 , flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train @entity9 border police charged with making the country 's massive , porous borders more secure . it 's one of the many jobs that the @entity50 military just is n't staffed to tackle on its own . in fact , the @entity50 military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors . there are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors . and that 's the problem . the @entity50 has come to rely on them so heavily , in such a short period of time , that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately . even among the eight - member team that makes up the @entity81 , a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in @entity18 and @entity9 , the question of whether the @entity50 needs the contractors is n't even an issue . the issue , rather , is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in @entity18 . in its interim report released this month , the @entity81 found that " neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years ' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts . " the report also said , " the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions . the decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed - security and life - support tasks for military units . " one of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern - day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur . that has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the @entity121 , as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas . @entity128 , head of the @entity129 , an industry - friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies , spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards . " we have the power to kick people out of the association , " @entity128 said , but that 's about where it ends . they ca n't prosecute anyone . but to say that there has been no progress on the legal front would n't be fair . legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the @entity150 , but with everything in this business , there was a hang - up with that , too . the legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the @entity37 , but there are even more contractors working in support of the @entity45 and other @entity50 agencies . the special inspector general for @entity18 , @entity163 produced a report in february titled @entity165 : the @entity166 . he then testified before @entity168 that " the @entity50 government was unprepared and ill - equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in @entity18 in 2003 . for the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve . " he also told members of @entity168 that the @entity50 relies too heavily on the hired help , testifying that " outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations . " something that retired lt. gen. @entity182 would undoubtedly agree with . @entity182 , who led the @entity50 military operation in the early days of the @entity18 war , has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate . he 's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees . guess what . contractors were involved in that scandal , too . as for @entity6 , scandal , or the suspicion of it , played a significant role in its downturn . plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations , the company now called @entity6 is a shell of what @entity6 was five years ago . most of @entity5 's top executives are gone , budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots , as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces . is @entity6 's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry ? hardly . as @entity129 's @entity128 puts it , they 're here to stay , its about time we made it work . " i think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we 're going to be working with the private sector . nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs , guarding gates , that kind of thing .

" goodbye and @entity17 bless to @entity1 from one of his friends peace and love , " tweeted @entity13 drummer @entity20 . @entity1 began as a singer in @entity24 at the same time as the @entity13 , with whom he was often linked . he played pubs across the country in a series of rock bands before he and his @entity30 recorded " with a @entity14 " in 1968 with @entity31 , @entity32 and others . the song became a no. 1 hit in @entity24 and propelled him to @entity12 , where his passionate live version was a festival highlight and launched his @entity39 career . @entity1 scored another major success in the early 1970s with " @entity41 , " a live album and concert film . " @entity10 , " his duet with @entity45 from the movie " @entity47 , " was @entity1 's biggest @entity39 hit , topping the @entity49 singles charts in 1982 . it also won him a @entity51 , and the @entity52 for best original song . @entity1 was known for his spasmodic movements on stage , where he often flailed his arms as he sang . his distinctive moves , he said , were almost accidental . " i never played organ or piano or guitar , so it was more out of frustration and me just trying to impersonate in a way , " @entity1 told the @entity58 in 2012 . " i did it subconsciously . people mistook for me being ill , like i had palsy . i 'm not nearly so demonstrative now , but i still have my own way of feeling the rhythm . " @entity1 also had lesser hits with covers of torch classic " @entity72 , " @entity73 's " feeling alright , " the @entity75 ' " @entity74 " and the @entity13 ' " @entity76 . " in the 1980s his witty cover of @entity78 's " @entity81 , " was featured in the erotic drama " 9 1/2 weeks " and became a strip - tease anthem . the singer told the @entity83 in 2013 that by the 1970s his descent into drugs and alcohol had become so severe that he sometimes forgot the lyrics to songs . " if i 'd been stronger mentally , i could have turned away from temptation , " @entity1 said . " but there was no rehab back in those days . drugs were readily available , and i dived in head first . and once you get into that downward spiral , it 's hard to pull out of it . it took me years to get straight . " he credited his wife , @entity99 , with helping him get sober . " it was @entity99 who helped me get myself back together , " he said . " she made me think positively . i was very down on myself . she made me realize people still wanted to hear me sing , and convinced me i could escape the downward spiral . " in 2012 he released the album , " @entity105 . " that year he talked to @entity106 about the project and his love of his life in @entity110 -- despite the harsh winters . " i embrace the winter these days , " he said in the interview . " the best thing to do is get a big house . if you are going to have cabin fever , have a big cabin . i walk on a regular basis , i have a couple of dogs . the house tucks right into the mountains . i literally feel i have become a mountain man over these past couple of years . " musicians of all ages and genres took to @entity128 to pay tribute .

@placeholder 's example will create a new dynamic for social media companies that ipo	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- when the dust settled on @entity4 's ipo on thursday afternoon , the company was valued at $ 8.9 billion , making it worth more than household names like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 . as the biggest internet ipo since @entity12 and the first pure social networking site to go public , its jaw - dropping opening - day surge of 109 % will also go down as a watershed moment for the @entity16 , as historically significant as the debuts of @entity18 in 1995 , @entity19 in 1998 and @entity12 in 2004 . whereas @entity18 's ipo symbolized the dawn of the dotcom boom , @entity19 's epitomized the height of irrational exuberance and @entity12 's ushered in a renaissance of tech innovation after the internet bubble burst , @entity4 's debut will be remembered as social media 's arrival on the capitalist stage known as @entity32 . for starters , @entity4 's lofty valuation by most anyone 's standards ( at thursday 's closing price of $ 94 , it 's trading at 36 times its 2010 revenue ; @entity12 trades at five times ) will have venture capitalists scrambling to take their internet investments public . as venture capitalist @entity43 put it on @entity44 , " @entity4 is @entity18 of this decade . ipo window blown wide open . " further , the social dynamics that companies like @entity4 thrive on offer something completely different from the first - generation @entity51 companies : incredibly rapid and organic growth . whereas in the 1990s , web companies shelled out tens of millions of dollars on advertising to find users , today 's social media leaders like @entity4 acquire new users through network effects -- their services become more valuable to users when their friends sign up . this trend is n't going away , and there are undoubtedly dozens if not hundreds of little - known or yet - to - be - founded startups that will go from zero to publicly traded juggernaut in remarkably shorts periods of time . add to that the fact that @entity51 companies with a lot more sex appeal than @entity4 -- including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 ( makers of @entity79 ) -- are all likely to go public within the next year , and you have @entity4 taking the pole position in what will be a tidal wave of social media companies entering the public markets . aside from the almost inevitable historical significance , however , is the new dynamic that will be created for social media companies that ipo . as entities that depend on their users to grow through word of mouth , there will suddenly be a need for community - centric services to balance the needs of their members with the expectations of @entity32 . there are only a few examples to draw on to predict how this may play out . in their " @entity106 " in 2004 , @entity12 's @entity104 and @entity105 wrote that their goal was , " to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible . in pursuing this goal , we may do things that we believe have a positive impact on the world , even if the near term financial returns are not obvious . " indeed , the company 's stock has been punished at times when investments in businesses that have become enormously important to @entity12 -- like @entity122 -- were n't showing results on the bottom line . in the long run , of course , this philosophy has helped @entity12 's stock price increase by more than five times since going public . while some of today 's soon - to - be - public social media companies might not be quite so aspirational , they certainly will face similar challenges . will @entity75 play more ads on its internet radio service to beef up its numbers ? will the quality of @entity74 's daily deals diminish as it looks to keep its tremendous growth rate intact ? will @entity73 finally push the privacy envelope too far in the name of meeting earnings estimates ? these are the types of decisions that the current generation of @entity51 companies will have to make when they enter the public markets . we 've already seen one prominent example of a company not finding the right balance and the dire consequences that can result . while @entity155 's fall from grace can be attributed to a variety of factors , there is no disputing that innovation and user experience languished after its 2005 acquisition by @entity162 , paving the way for @entity73 to swoop in and take the social networking crown . returning to @entity4 , while today 's story about its ipo may be about whether it represents a new financial bubble in the internet sector , the story in years to come will be its symbolism in changing the world in which social media companies operate . let 's hope , as @entity104 and @entity105 put it so well in 2004 , that the change leaves a positive impact on the world .	@entity155:MySpace	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:JC Penney	@entity4:LinkedIn	@entity9:Chipotle	@entity8:Electronic Arts	@entity51:Internet	@entity79:FarmVille	@entity75:Pandora	@entity74:Groupon	@entity77:Zynga	@entity76:Yelp	@entity73:Facebook	@entity16:Web	@entity32:Wall Street	@entity12:Google	@entity19:TheGlobe.com	@entity18:Netscape	@entity104:Sergey	@entity105:Larry	@entity106:Founders ' IPO Letter	@entity122:Android	@entity162:News Corp.	@entity167:IPO	@entity44:Twitter	@entity43:Albert Wenger
she was a trailblazer on the @placeholder press corps	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- trailblazing @entity4 journalist @entity3 has died at age 92 after a long illness , sources told @entity1 saturday . @entity7 covered 10 presidents over nearly half a century , and became a legend in the industry . she was a fixture at @entity4 news conferences -- sitting front and center late in her career -- where she frequently exasperated government spokesmen with her pointed questions . @entity7 began covering the @entity4 for @entity20 when @entity21 became president in 1961 and was a fixture there until her retirement in 2010 . she was considered the dean of the @entity4 press corps because she was the longest - serving @entity4 journalist . @entity7 will be buried in @entity29 , and a memorial service is planned in @entity0 in october , according to her family . president @entity33 said that it was " not just the length of her tenure , but her fierce belief that our democracy works best when we ask tough questions and hold our leaders to account , " that put her in high esteem . in a written statement , @entity33 called @entity7 a " true pioneer " and said she kept the presidents she covered -- including himself -- on their toes . " @entity3 was just a living inspiration " her career , however , came to an end under a cloud of controversy . @entity7 , then working for the media conglomerate @entity55 as a syndicated columnist , was blasted for comments she made regarding @entity60 people . in 2010 , a @entity62 video surfaced showing her saying that @entity66 should " get the hell out of @entity65 , " and that the @entity60 people should go home to " @entity68 , @entity69 ... and @entity70 and everywhere else . " @entity7 apologized for her remarks , writing , " they do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the @entity76 only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance . may that day come soon . " she announced her retirement one week later . in 2012 , @entity84 official @entity83 presented @entity7 with an award . she was a mentor to young journalists @entity3 : fast facts @entity7 , the daughter of @entity90 immigrants , was born in @entity91 , @entity92 , on august 4 , 1920 . she was one of nine children . @entity7 was raised in @entity29 , where she attended @entity95 and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in 1942 . in october 1971 , @entity7 married @entity97 ; he died in 1982 . she wrote three books : " @entity100 at the @entity4 : @entity101 " ( 1999 ) ; " @entity103 mr. president : wit and wisdom from the @entity100 at the @entity4 " ( 2002 ) ; and " @entity106 ? the waning @entity107 and how it has @entity108 " ( 2006 ) . share your memories in describing her job , @entity7 once said , " i 've never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible . " along the way , she broke some barriers by becoming the first female president of the prestigious @entity119 and @entity0 's @entity120 . " i hope there are many women following me right in this same spot , " she said . well into her 80s , she was a mentor to many young journalists . @entity7 left @entity20 in may 2000 , when the wire service was sold to a company controlled by the rev. @entity128 , the @entity129 founder and leader of the worldwide @entity131 . two months later , @entity132 hired her as a syndicated columnist , and she returned to the @entity4 for fodder for her columns . former president @entity137 and his wife , former secretary of state @entity138 , recalled @entity7 ' " tough - minded dedication . " " @entity3 was a pioneering journalist who , while adding more than her share of cracks to the glass ceiling , never failed to bring intensity and tenacity to her @entity4 beat , " the @entity146 said in a statement . " ... her work was extraordinary because of her intelligence , her lively spirit and great sense of humor , and most importantly her commitment to the role of a strong press in a healthy democracy . " no question seemed off - limits colleagues remember her as a genuinely fearless woman who asked the toughest questions of presidents , no matter their party . in january 2009 , as president @entity163 was preparing to leave office , @entity7 aimed her editorial guns at him and his administration . among her criticisms : that before the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , administration officials ignored " significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the @entity70 " journalists remember @entity3 in a commentary , she slammed @entity163 for what she considered his failings , including leading the country " into a senseless war against @entity178 , a calamity still under way as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion . " she considered him " the worst president ever . " @entity7 embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor . " i censored myself for 50 years when i was a reporter , " @entity7 told an audience at the @entity189 ( @entity190 ) in late 2002 . " now i wake up and ask myself , ' who do i hate today ? ' " one afternoon in october 2009 , she targeted president @entity33 's spokesman , @entity192 , during the daily briefing . health care reform was being debated at the time , and @entity7 asked @entity192 every day whether a public option would be part of the package . in the back - and - forth that ensued , @entity7 said that she already had reached a conclusion but could not get a straight answer from the presidential spokesman . " then why do you keep asking me ? " @entity192 inquired . " because i want your conscience to bother you , " @entity7 replied . the room broke into laughter as @entity192 turned red . people we 've lost in 2013 @entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and journalist @entity212 contributed to this report .	@entity20:UPI	@entity21:John F.

@entity9 says when @entity16 handed @entity0 to @entity14 , @placeholder was not " simply robbed , it was plundered "	@entity7	it 's official , @entity0 is @entity2 . in the words of @entity9 , " in people 's hearts and minds , @entity0 has always been an inseparable part of @entity7 . " indeed @entity7 said that in sunday 's referendum 97 % of its participants , mostly ethnic @entity2 , insisted that to belong to the @entity7 versus @entity12 ( @entity12 , another name for @entity14 ) had been their dream for 60 years since the @entity17 leader @entity16 , my great - grandfather , transferred the peninsula 's jurisdiction to @entity21 . in his address to @entity23 on march 18 announcing the annexation , @entity9 said that by this @entity16 action @entity7 was not " simply robbed , it was plundered . " there are many reasons for transfer that @entity9 could have outlined : administrative , economic , desire to overcome @entity31 's legacy of central control . yet he chose to say my great - grandfather was atoning for " the mass repressions of the 1930s in @entity14 . " well , @entity16 became the first secretary of the @entity37 in 1938 , when most of the repressions -- namely @entity40 , the @entity41 , brought in part by @entity31 's heavy industrialization -- were over . it is rich of the @entity2 president to accuse @entity16 of repressions . what about @entity31 , the true tyrant ? @entity9 is not @entity31 , of course , not yet , but he sees himself walking in the dictator 's shoes : he adds lands to the great @entity7 , while other sorry leaders like @entity16 only squandered it away . not that @entity16 , a @entity17 autocrat , shied away from brutality , indeed participating in repressions and purges -- that was the style of the times . nonetheless , after @entity31 's death in 1953 his goal was to decentralize the @entity61 monolith , hence the @entity0 transfer . no stranger to propaganda -- @entity65 excelled in arguing @entity17 superiority over ethnic national pride , @entity14 or any other , as well as over decadent and dying capitalism -- @entity16 still would have cringed at @entity9 's distortions . " @entity21 is the mother of @entity2 cities . @entity77 is our common source and we can not live without each other , " the president said , implying that given this closeness @entity7 must have control over the @entity76 territory . @entity16 too thought that @entity14 and @entity7 were almost one -- after all a symbolic reason for the 1954 transfer was the 300th anniversary of the @entity14 - @entity2 unification . but he would think of them as equal nations , assigning the original primacy to the 9th century @entity21 , not to @entity89 , which until the 1100s was just an obscure place in the woods . @entity16 , who valued diversity ( as much as the @entity17 despot could ) would have condemned the @entity95 -- development of the military industrial complex based on the @entity99 - centric heavy industry and export of raw materials . in @entity17 times that complex was a staple of the economy , as the main slogan of the @entity99 was the class struggle against global imperialism . and even if my great - grandfather used that argument in @entity112 , sending tanks to suppress the @entity114 , a popular uprising against hardline communism , he lamented similar tactics in 1968 when his successor @entity117 squashed the @entity118 . under @entity117 this kind of incursions into neighboring territories became known as the @entity122 . it declared that forces hostile to socialism should not be tolerated , and to cement this argument in 1979 the @entity127 send troops to @entity129 to provide security to its recently formed @entity131 . @entity16 died in 1971 and did n't see what harm the @entity129 war did to his country -- thousands of lives lost and the economy strained by the time it withdrew with defeat exactly a quarter of a century ago -- but he , who in retirement spoke candidly of his and @entity65 's mistakes , would have been horrified by the stanchness of the @entity99 's patterns . today @entity9 would undoubtedly suggest that @entity0 is not different from @entity129 . speaking to the veterans about the @entity129 invasion in february 2004 , he explained there were legitimate geopolitical reasons to protect the @entity17 @entity149 border . now citing security of nations within @entity89 's sphere of influence he has justified the @entity14 territorial takeover . what 's more , in the @entity117 era the expansionist policies of the military industrial complex were a result of the oil prosperity . after the 1973 oil crisis its prices reached 41 dollars a barrel by 1981 . they provided some material comforts to the @entity17 , fueled their belief in the @entity127 's stability and strength . similarly , with oil at around $ 100 a barrel in recent decades , the gdp growth under @entity9 -- up 8 % until just a few years ago -- allowed @entity2 to live well like never before , also cultivating a sense of superiority . the success of the @entity176 last month has only made it greater . in fact the @entity179 ' desire to join @entity7 is partially based on their trust that @entity9 will turn them into another @entity183 , with posh hotels and pristine beaches . but the cost of upgrading or rebuilding the peninsula 's economic and social infrastructure will range from $ 10 billion ( 300 billion rubles ) to $ 85 billion ( 3 trillion rubles ) . can @entity7 really foot that bill ? a bitter lesson from the @entity127 is that the state , driven by an undiversified and oil - based economy , runs out of funds to support its extra territories because nationalistic emotions take over economic calculations . @entity2 inflexible financial system was suffering even before the @entity14 crisis began . last year 's forecasts suggest that in the next 15 years @entity7 's growth rate would fall from 4.3 % to 2.5 % if it keeps its raw material focus . now with the @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 hitting the @entity99 with sanctions -- account freezes and visa bans for the high level @entity9 government officials -- further economic downturn is inevitable . the @entity122 -- defense of socialism through expansion and the military industrial complex -- had led to the inglorious @entity17 collapse . the doomsday of the @entity95 must be approaching fast .	@entity23:Parliament	@entity21:Kiev	@entity117:Brezhnev	@entity221:Nina Khrushcheva	@entity114:1956 Hungarian Revolution	@entity112:Budapest	@entity89:Moscow	@entity131:Democratic Republic	@entity118:Prague Spring	@entity2:Russian	@entity0:Crimea	@entity7:Russia	@entity176:Sochi Olympics	@entity179:Crimeans	@entity9:Putin	@entity77:Ancient Rus	@entity76:Malorossian	@entity31:Stalin	@entity16:Khrushchev	@entity14:Ukraine	@entity12:Malorossiya	@entity37:Ukrainian Communist Party	@entity99:Kremlin	@entity129:Afghan	@entity127:Brezhnev USSR	@entity95:Putin Doctrine	@entity122:Brezhnev Doctrine	@entity206:Japan	@entity205:Europe	@entity204:United States	@entity17:Soviet	@entity228:West	@entity183:Sochi	@entity149:Central Asian	@entity40:Holodomor	@entity41:Great Famine	@entity65:Communism	@entity61:Communist
$ 200 @placeholder headband reads brainwaves and allows you to to play smartphone games with your mind	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- it 's the $ 199 headband that will allow you to control things using your mind , the makers say . the @entity7 headband was unveiled this week at @entity8 and @entity0 caught up with founder of @entity10 for a demonstration of the brainwave - sensing headband . @entity10 says @entity7 works using the same technology used in hospitals known as @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , which records electrical activity along the scalp . @entity7 is embedded with four sensors that allows you to see and track your brain 's activity , in the same way a heart rate monitor gives information about your physical activity . you can also use your mind to control games and applications supplied with the headband , @entity10 says . " it interacts with content directly with your mind so you can play games that you are able to control with your mind , " says the @entity31 neuroscientist and entrepreneur . connecting to any device such as a smartphone , tablet or laptop via bluetooth , @entity7 can be worn on the go and includes a " brain fitness suite " app that tracks the state of your brain or can help you de-stress . she adds : " and as you play the games , you are working with and strengthening your mind . the most important thing is that it can help you improve your cognitive and emotional function , it shows you your brain activity and gives you targeted exercises to improve both cognitive and emotional functioning . " @entity7 will help with improving brain function , power and memory in the same way @entity58 and crosswords do presently , explains @entity10 . " but they are doing that on an indirect level , we are moving it one scale up with @entity7 , " she says . @entity65 : discover all the action from @entity8 on @entity0 @entity10 first talked about the concept of thought - controlled computer technology at @entity8 two years ago . since then she has raised nearly double the $ 150,000 she sought on the @entity70 crowd - funding website . " research labs have been using this tech for years , now its time to bring all this understanding and improvements to the consumer , taking it from the labs to your inbox , " she says . " the most important part of ourselves is the mind and it has been rather inaccessible . this is a tool that helps unlock the mind in really exciting ways . people seem pretty excited , " she adds . " there has n't been a person i 've spoken to who has n't wanted one . " i confess to being excited too as i slipped on the lightweight and sleek - looking headband which rests on the forehead and tucks behind the ears , like a pair of glasses . @entity7 was connected to a laptop and felt comfortable as i got ready to try out a special demo application called @entity101 , a mood - based text editor that changes fonts depending on your brainwave activity . it felt strange watching my brain in real - time on the screen in front of me as @entity10 asked me to blink and showed me how the action impacted my brainwaves . more from @entity8 : cyborg anthropologist : we can all be superhuman then she asked me to type something . " i miss my daughter , " i wrote and was surprised to see the font suddenly change to a more flowery style as i typed out daughter . @entity120 explained that as i focused on what to type in the beginning , the text was clean and tight and as i became more open and relaxed the text appeared more flowery . when someone is smiling , the letters will suddenly appear very big , she explained . undoubtedly , @entity101 , though only a demo at present , has huge implications for new ways of communication in the real and virtual world in the future . developers will be excited at the possibility of creating applications that could perhaps be used to convey information through avatars . could it be the end of the exclamation mark ? @entity7 is available to buy on the @entity70 website until december 7 for early adopters and after that , will be available again in june 2013 , when they start shipping . are you excited about @entity7 ? will you be buying it ? let us know in the comments .	@entity31:Canadian	@entity15:EEG	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Muse	@entity10:Ariel Garten	@entity8:LeWeb	@entity101:EmoType	@entity58:Sudoku	@entity65:LeBlog	@entity157:Stephanie Busari	@entity70:Indiegogo	@entity120:Ariel

@placeholder 's @entity0 says " @entity7 intends " any pregnancies that come from rape	@entity2	@entity3 @entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 believes that rapes resulting in pregnancy are " something that @entity7 intends to happen . " do you ? it 's a relevant question as we enter the last two weeks of this election , because @entity0 's comments are not isolated . the statement comes from the same rigid ideology behind conservative @entity1 candidate @entity16 's musings in august , when he said women 's bodies have the ability to " shut down " pregnancies that result from what he called " legitimate rape . " @entity0 and @entity16 were both trying to explain their determination to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest , a position consistent with the @entity2 platform , which calls for a constitutional ban on abortion . @entity35 and some other leading republicans repudiated @entity16 's comment . but as i pointed out in a @entity41 column at the time , the problem seemed to lie with the politics and optics rather than underlying policy . republicans are desperately trying to close the gender gap with women , and one way to do it is to insist that this election is only about economic issues . but many conservative candidates for @entity1 harbor deep - seated social conservative views , an absolute opposition to abortion among them . it 's a position that vice-presidential nominee @entity56 has long held . most @entity57 believe that abortion should be " safe , legal and rare .

new : " his talent had no boundaries , " model @placeholder says	@entity122	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- top @entity6 fashion designer @entity5 , who dressed stars from @entity8 to @entity9 to @entity10 in bold shapes and colors , was found dead in his home here thursday , a spokesman for his company said . though his reputation for controversy earned him the titles " enfant terrible " and " the hooligan of @entity1 fashion , " @entity15 editor @entity14 said his work " influenced a whole generation of designers . " his brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs . at one level he was a master of the fantastic , creating astounding fashions shows that mixed design , technology and performance , and on another he was a modern day genius whose gothic aesthetic was adopted by women the world over . his death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who did n't , " said a statement from @entity14 on the magazine 's web site . asked about reports of @entity5 's death , @entity0 's @entity46 said a 40 - year - old man was found dead at an address in @entity51 , central @entity0 . they would not confirm his identity and said the death was not being treated as suspicious . " at this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with @entity5 's family , " said a statement issued from his company on behalf of the family of the designer , who was born @entity5 . " @entity5 's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this . " according to a posting on @entity5 's @entity78 page , the designer 's mother died february 2 . " i 'm letting my followers know the my mother passed away yesterday , " said an entry posted at 11:46 a.m. february 3 . " @entity83 , " it added . one minute later , the message " but life must go on ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " was tweeted . the account has not been verified by @entity78 as officially coming from @entity5 , although the page does link to his web site . his death comes just a week before the opening of the famed @entity91 . " we are deeply shocked and saddened at the news of @entity5 's untimely death , " said a statement on the @entity91 web site . " he was a unique talent and one of the world 's greatest designers . our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time . " although @entity5 was not showing a collection at the @entity91 , he was to unveil his ready - to - wear collection at the @entity107 fashion shows in march . his 2010 spring / summer collection featured alien - inspired makeup and prints , according to @entity15 , and " was lauded as his best by the fashion press . " dresses in that ready - to - wear line had exaggerated tiny waists and rounded hips , and models on the catwalk wore high club - like boots with them . model @entity122 said she was " truly devastated " by @entity5 's death . " his talent had no boundaries and he was an inspiration to everyone who worked with him and knew him , " she said in a statement released by her publicist . " this is a sad day to all who loved him around the world and my condolences are with his family . i will miss him so much , he will never be forgotten . " designer @entity137 called @entity5 " one of a - kind " and said in a statement that he was " one of the most talented designers of his generation . this is a big loss for the world . " a manager at the @entity5 store in @entity147 said the shop would be closed thursday and friday in light of the designer 's death . appearing on @entity2 thursday before news of @entity5 's death broke , singer @entity154 -- known for her ground - breaking fashion -- spoke of her admiration for the designer . " he is so -- he is on his own planet . he does n't need to respond to trends or what anyone else is doing , " @entity154 said in an interview on " @entity160 . " he is so pure and from within and i -- he just generally inspires me ... and i love when i can wear his clothes and sort of synthesize for my fans what it means to me , because i want them escape through his clothes the way that i do . " according to a biography of @entity5 on @entity15 's web site , he was born in 1970 in @entity0 's @entity174 , the son of a taxi driver . he trained in @entity0 's @entity177 at a company that made suits for @entity180 . one anecdote that helped cement his bad - boy image claimed that he had once embroidered a suit for the @entity184 with a profanity sewn into the lining . his clothing line was purchased in 1991 by stylist @entity188 , who became a close friend . she committed suicide in 2007 , five years after his label was brought into the @entity192 , based in @entity107 , @entity193 . in an interview with @entity2 's @entity195 in october , @entity5 -- whose work was also worn by @entity197 and @entity198 -- talked about how the traditional runway shows for fashion designers are changing . his latest show was an invitation event for 1,000 people and was streamed live on the @entity204 . " it 's got to progress , and it 's got to move on , " he said . " i 've been doing these shows for over 15 years now ; i must have done about 60 shows . even i get bored with the same concept , so this way , i can see a brighter future for fashion .

@entity239 says it has had some successes in its five - year war with @placeholder extremists	@entity23	( @entity0 ) -- on monday , news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in @entity4 , in the northeastern state of @entity6 -- a region at the center of @entity10 's five - year terrorist insurgency . the very next day , the @entity10 military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued . this turned out to be untrue . the school 's principal and the girls ' parents complained that the girls were still missing . in august last year , a military spokesman announced the death of @entity21 , the leader of @entity23 extremist group @entity22 , at the hands of the military . but like the news of the release of the schoolgirls , it proved to be fiction . ' misleading sources ' incidents like this have come to shape the way the military is perceived in the wildly unpredictable battle against @entity22 . posts on the military 's social media accounts regularly boast of " smoking out " or ambushing terrorists or recovering weapons -- often written in way that brings to mind @entity44 's infamous former information minister under @entity45 , dubbed " @entity46 , " who claimed coalition forces were in retreat even as @entity50 tanks rolled almost unchallenged across the country in 2003 . like him they 've also ended up pinning the blame for inaccurate reporting on " misleading " sources . even when there is truth to its narratives -- and there have been major successes , including a crackdown that started in early 2013 that killed several top @entity65 commanders and driven others across the border into @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- the triumphalism seems odd when juxtaposed with the harsh reality of events like the @entity4 abduction , or the one at another government school in neighboring @entity75 in february , in which more than fifty schoolboys were murdered in their dormitories , with nary a soldier in sight until several hours later . perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it can not afford to sound anything otherwise . or perhaps it 's simply because it can get away with it -- because the @entity10 authorities have a long and remarkable history of getting away with anything they say . that tenuous relationship with fact makes it relatively easy for senior government officials to publicly dispute government finances to the tune of billions of dollars ; and for an assortment of newspaper headlines to display wildly differing casualty figures the morning after a bombing incident . death ' cheap and plentiful ' and then there 's the scale of @entity10 's tragedies . for a country that is not at war , death is cheap and plentiful . so cheap and so sweeping in its audacity that @entity10 readily make jokes about it . that might help explain the trademark blunted edge of @entity10 outrage . if it happens often enough , the mind is soon inured , and eagerly accepting of the sense of resignation that might offer the best protection against the emotional impact of the next cycle of negative breaking news . all of the above combine to create the context in which the @entity10 military -- wielding political power for 29 of @entity10 's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate . not since the civil war , almost 50 years ago , has it been tested this much . the closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in @entity131 and @entity132 , in which it played a prominent role at the head of the @entity136 , intended more as a " peacekeeping " unit than a combat force . indeed what we are seeing may be evidence of its struggle to adapt to new rules of engagement , fighting an enemy driven by convictions much deeper than those displayed by the pro-democracy activists and diamond - obsessed rebels it contended with in the 1990s ; possessing access to sophisticated weapons , and operating in terrain far better suited to insurgents than conventional armies . abuse claims the increasing militarization of the troubled zones has since spurred accusations of human rights abuses , from local and international observers . an @entity164 report from april 2014 has called for an end to the use of " heavy - handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless , jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism . " communication strategies also require overhaul . in the age of social media , the military needs to realize that propaganda is now a lot more likely to be found out and discredited . news reports suggest that the military , long hampered by aging hardware , is now acquiring new weapons and equipment . that 's heartwarming . in a country where institutional graft is the rule and not the exception , it is crucial to ensure that the military budgets are spent to boost the military 's capability , and troops ' morale -- and not pocketed by bigwigs . international cooperation also needs to be stepped up ; and it does seem that the government is now more willing than ever to work with @entity199 and @entity50 . @entity10 have long been wary of allowing the @entity50 military the sort of foothold it has in countries like @entity204 and @entity205 , but there 's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control . finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government 's planned shift to a " soft " counter-terrorism strategy , embodied in a document unveiled by @entity217 , @entity218 , a retired @entity220 colonel , in march . amid the backlash it has faced recently , the beleaguered military can count on the support of a growing number of @entity10 , who think that it is being under appreciated for the work it is doing . just this week a " support the @entity230 " page launched on @entity229 , in honor of " our military men and women on the field who risk their lives daily to keep us safe .

@entity1 handed penalty after collision with @entity17 at @placeholder	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's shining star @entity1 has been rapped over the knuckles and " told to take more care " when riding his bike by the sport 's organisers . running away with the @entity9 in his debut season , the 20 - year - old @entity8 has been handed a penalty point and his @entity12 docked their points scored for @entity1 's @entity15 victory following his collision with teammate @entity17 . the pair had been scrapping for second place in the race two weekends ago when @entity1 made contact with @entity17 after misjudging the braking point at @entity23 . it broke a sensor cable on his fellow @entity8 's rear wheel and eventually led to @entity17 crashing out of the race . the latest punishment takes @entity1 to three penalty points this season as part of a points system that was introduced at the end of last year . should the @entity8 pick up another penalty , he will have to start the next grand prix from the back of the grid . the penalty was dished out following a half - hour meeting with race direction , both riders and team management at the @entity43 , which will host sunday 's @entity44 . " we are sending a message to @entity1 , very clearly , " said race director @entity45 . " we understand that he is an extremely talented rider but he is also intelligent enough to understand there has to be some margin for error -- especially , as we have seen a number of times this year , under braking when the rider behind has the responsibility of not getting too close to the rider in front who is riding his own lines . " for us , that is a signal ( even though the contact itself was quite minor ) to make a formal warning by way of a penalty point to @entity1 to say he has to take more care . " @entity12 boss @entity65 admitted the team penalty was down to what was considered a safety lapse -- the failure of their traction - control system and the back - up unit , which , along with contact with @entity1 , caused the @entity17 crash . " we need to think about it and see whether we have to make an appeal or not , " said @entity65 . as for the @entity1 penalty , @entity65 added : " @entity1 has been penalized with one point on his license . " that means there is no consequence for this race . basically , they said that in this case it was more or less ok but they are taking @entity1 's whole season into consideration and he has been close to touching the rider in front of him on more than one occasion . " the message was basically , ' this time it was ok but realize that you have been doing this quite often ' .

@entity380 is a past world , @entity21 and @entity22 champion now targeting @placeholder glory	@entity26	( @entity0 ) -- it is akin to @entity2 designing his own @entity4 car , getting in the cockpit and driving it to the world title . in @entity4 , it would be a mission impossible ; in the winter sport of skeleton racing it is , at the very least , a monstrous mission improbable which briton @entity13 has made an infinite reality from the unlikeliest of beginnings . it has earned him the nickname @entity13 and brought him world , @entity21 and @entity22 titles . the one medal missing from the trophy cabinet is an @entity26 one , achieved by his fiancee and mother of the couple 's daughter , @entity29 , @entity29 , who won silver seven years ago in @entity32 on one of the sleds he designed . there is a somewhat laughable nature to how he found a new career path in such cutting - edge design while based at @entity40 and tasked with working on the @entity41 , which made its combat debut in @entity43 in 2011 with the @entity44 and @entity46 @entity45 . " i got a memo sent round internally inviting me to a talk about @entity50 , " he recalls . " i 'd never heard of the sport so i asked one of the guys , ' who is @entity50 ? ' -- i thought it was a guy to start with . " you can imagine my surprise that it turned out to be a sport that changed my life completely . " it is a leap of faith to go from the @entity41 , which cost an approximate √Ç ¬£ 200m each , to design what is effectively a steel tray designed to ensure an athlete is propelled at speeds of up to 130km/h down a sheet ice bobsled run -- head first . " i just got hooked on the sport , " he admits . " i 'd finished at university and was back at @entity70 ( now @entity40 ) and we were approached by the @entity22 skeleton team to help with their performance . " at the time , they were at the back of the field using second - hand equipment from whoever they could . " i was one of the @entity22 graduates starting and , three months later , i was the only one working on it , and i got @entity83 to sponsor it . " sink or swim it spawned his phd on " factors affecting the performance of skeleton bobsleds " but it was never with a view to competing himself , which came about by force rather than forethought on his part . " i first went to @entity96 in @entity97 with something put together with a few nuts and bolts and none of the @entity22 team would ride it , " he recalls . " there was this rule , you had to prove it first . so it was a simple decision that i could either sink or swim . " he swam or at least crashed , got on again , got hooked and could not stop . two years later , he was competing properly and after just a year of competition he was @entity22 @entity109 . fittingly , he won his first major crown -- the @entity111 -- at the same @entity96 venue in 2004 before winning the world title four years later at the same venue , one that has in many ways defined him . if he was a designer first and a competitor second , the two now run in parallel . for the early years of his career , he used @entity40 as his base to create the skeleton before launching @entity123 with his brother @entity124 in 2000 . working together , @entity13 the competitor designs the sleds , brother @entity124 manufactures them . for @entity13 , the older of the two siblings , his engineering began -- with an admittedly @entity26 slant -- when he nailed a pair of his @entity132 boots to two planks of wood to create his own @entity136 skis in his father 's workshop as a five - year - old . " i always liked making things but particularly making things go fast , so this was an inevitable end in some ways . " the process has become increasingly technical in the intervening years but he still insists the approach can be simplistic at its core . " you break it down as having to go from point a to point b , and you have a certain amount of energy , " he explains , " some of which gets lost along the way . my work is to make sure it is more efficient and goes faster . i design it , and i 'm the test pilot too . " drawing board despite his engineering background he had no experience in computer - aided design nor computational fluid dynamics , a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods to solve and analyze issues concerning fluid flows , but , with the help of sponsors , he sat himself down and taught himself . " i 've always been of the view that yes there are hurdles but there are ways around them , " he adds , " and it 's a never - ending task because you can always go faster . the key is understanding , if you understand the problems , you can go faster . " @entity13 explains that he has virtually gone back to the drawing board to create a sled capable of winning him that , as yet , elusive @entity26 title in the last two years . what that is exactly , he is loathe to go into detail at the risk of alerting his rivals to what he sees could be a potential advantage but he also argues it is not just about the sled . " i want to give myself and @entity29 the best possible chance but the sled does n't win , the athlete does , " he says , looking forward to the @entity26 in @entity194 early next year . " for example , at @entity40 i had the most cutting - edge materials . i based the sled on the air duct of the @entity41 using carbon fibre , but it did n't necessarily make the sled go faster . " the current sled has a steel chassis for its base , able to deal with the top speeds that will be hit in @entity194 , the four or five gs going through it , with @entity13 on board akin to half a tonne at full pelt on the ice . " but again it 's all about understanding , " he says . " if you understand something , it 's easy to change it . " we 're always trying to understand the dynamics of the sled and the aerodynamics of the athlete . we also need to personalise the aero as what works for me wo n't necessarily work for @entity29 . " high - octane world for @entity13 , there are three key areas to his design approach : the aerodynamics , the runners on the ice with its control and handling , and the influence of the sled with its feel on the ice . to focus on that aero work in particular , he has sought the help of all and sundry , including the use of the wind tunnels of two @entity4 teams . much like @entity4 , mastering the tweaks and additions that work and do n't work can prove to be a very fine art. " i 'd say that 19 out of 20 times , you do stuff that does n't work , " he admits . " you have theories , isolate one thing but then it has an impact on everything else . " it can work in some ways and have a negative effect in others . but you do get that @entity257 moment when it clicks . i think i 've had that about seven times in my career and that 's certainly helped me to win major championships . " as for @entity13 the athlete , he is , by his own admission , an adrenalin junkie , his earlier love for motocross replaced by the similarly high - octane world of skeleton racing . in the past , he used to be an aggressive competitor in terms of his approach to a course , now he is more technical , more free - flowing , enabling him to let the sled do more of the work . so how will he do at @entity194 and will the course suit him ? " i hope so but a bit like an @entity4 driver , everyone has a favourite course and mine 's always been @entity281 , it 's where i still hold the course record . " at 41 , he is an older competitor although athletes have tended to win medals in the event in their late thirties and early forties . he still believes he is at his peak and for the first time in five seasons approaches the season start without an injury setback . his training is akin to that of a sprinter , explosive work in the gym , on the track and on the ice , although because of the nature of the sport , his sprinting is limited to 30 - metre bursts at the very maximum . ' @entity13 ' with age , the only major change has been allowing more recovery time and understanding his ageing limbs better . the @entity26 will be his last ever outing as a competitor , his focus after that solely on his future business and the aim is to get through this last season in one piece . to date , the worst injury he has sustained crashing is a broken hand but the death of @entity321 in the men 's luge at the same course as the skeleton at the last @entity26 highlights the inherent dangers of the sport . " there are risks at that speeds but the courses are designed for the sled to take the hit , " said @entity13 . " it 's about 30 or 40kg so you make sure it 's in front of you , then you just slide on . there 's ice burns but that 's usually the worst of it . but such is the design , you wo n't hit the ice head on , usually on the side . " " @entity13 , " so named by an @entity347 newspaper after he travelled back from @entity349 with a bobsled full of 20 gallons of water to freeze and better understand as part of his phd , will use brain and body will do their utmost to sort out the one caveat from his career cv . " anything can happen once you 're at the @entity362 but a medal 's realistic , " he says . science and skill will hold the key in what , come next year , will have been two decades dedicated to the discipline .	@entity22:British	@entity21:European	@entity26:Olympic	@entity29:Shelley Rudman	@entity83:Nottingham University	@entity111:European Championships	@entity257:Eureka	@entity136:DIY	@entity132:Wellington	@entity2:Sebastian Vettel	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:F1	@entity194:Sochi	@entity46:Italian	@entity50:Bob Skeleton	@entity70:British Aerospace	@entity32:Turin	@entity13:Bromley	@entity362:Games	@entity349:Salt Lake City	@entity97:Germany	@entity96:Altenberg	@entity124:Richard	@entity123:Bromley Technologies	@entity321:Nodar Kumaritashvili	@entity347:English	@entity44:Royal Air Force	@entity45:Air Force	@entity281:Lillehammer	@entity40:BAE	@entity41:Eurofighter	@entity43:Libya	@entity380:Briton	@entity109:No.1

@placeholder , other radio hosts took issue with baseball player taking two days of paternity leave	@entity0	even after @entity0 apologized for what he called his " insensitive " comment about scheduling a c - section before the season started , his suggestion plus critical stances by other radio hosts demonstrate how much paternity leave is still not widely accepted in our society . in conversations with men across the country , it 's clear that while most join many women in expressing outrage at the view that a @entity20 game should come before the birth of a child , there were men who felt the player should have gotten back to his job as quickly as possible . by now , you probably know the particulars : the @entity29 ' @entity28 missed the first two games of the season to attend his son 's birth . he did n't do anything he was n't allowed to do . @entity20 permits a player to take up to three days off for paternity leave . but @entity0 , his radio co-host @entity37 and another @entity39 radio host , @entity40 , had a very hard time understanding why @entity28 would take another day -- and be off the field -- after his son was born . " you 're a @entity20 player . you can hire a nurse , " said @entity40 on his radio show . @entity0 pulled back completely from his initial comment that if he were in @entity28 's shoes , he would have had his wife schedule a c - section before the season started . " my flippant comment was insensitive , " said @entity0 on his radio show friday , a day after intense criticism of his remarks . " i feel terrible for the @entity28 family because what should be the greatest time in their life turned out to be somewhat of a firestorm that i personally put them into . and for that , hopefully , they can find forgiveness in their heart . " a father of three , who did not want to be identified , said his biggest beef was not with @entity0 but with @entity40 's comments that @entity28 was n't needed after his son 's birth , or that anything he could have done could have been handled by a hired nurse . " that is total garbage , " said this dad via @entity73 . " whether a man makes minimum wage or the salary of a @entity20 ball player , his family deserves his undivided attention at the birth of his child . it does n't matter if he can easily hire someone to handle all the things that need to be done -- there is no substitute for the sense of accomplishment a man can get from having done it himself . " @entity93 , a stay - at - home dad in @entity94 , writer and author of " @entity97 , " found the comments of @entity0 and the other radio hosts " really sad " but believes the fact that the controversy involves a discussion about paternity leave is positive . " i 'd like to think that if there 's a silver lining from all this , it 's the realization or the confirmation that dads do want to be involved , and that the expectation is really gone away from wandering around the hallways handing out cigars to wanting to be in the birth room and being involved and hands - on from the get - go , " said @entity93 , who has another book coming out in a few weeks , " @entity105 . " but not all men think a man 's role is being by his wife and his new child 's side . on @entity127 's @entity73 page , a man named @entity125 said he agreed with @entity0 regarding scheduling a c - section before the season got underway . " it may seem insensitive but it 's a very special situation being a @entity20 player . i know in almost every other profession the right thing to do is to strap your boots on and go back to work because that 's what the man of the house does . " could he not afford to hire a nurse to wait on his wife hand and foot ? " he added . " real men do n't take paternity leave , " said a man named @entity146 on @entity127 's facebook page . when pressed by another commenter that it 's no longer the 1950s , @entity146 responded , " i wish it were the ' 50s . those were the days when men were men . " said another man on @entity73 , " my belief is that it 's a generation gap opinion . when ( @entity0 ) had kids , he was back to work the next day . " indeed , just by looking at the increase in the number of stay - at - home dads in the @entity162 , it 's clear our attitudes are shifting , even though not as rapidly as some would hope . " i think people have really latched onto the idea that no , culturally we 've changed , and we want to go in the direction of more involved dads as opposed to backwards of ' @entity173 ' checking in from out in the waiting room , " said @entity93 , who is the primary caregiver for his soon - to - be 8 - year - old daughter . still , when compared to our @entity176 counterparts , we are pretty much in the dark ages as far as paternity leave is concerned . in @entity180 , men get a minimum of two months paid paternity leave ; in @entity183 , they can take 10 weeks paid ; and in @entity184 , they get four weeks . in the @entity162 , there is no mandated paid paternity leave , although some companies do allow men to take 10 days off with pay . " in my case , i had to use vacation days when my twins were born , " said the father of three , who did n't want to be identified . " i get that we live in a world where women are n't treated equally to men when it comes to pay , promotions and a slew of other areas , but there are also areas where men 's needs are treated as inferior to those of a woman , and becoming a parent is a prime example , " he added . will we , one day , get to a place where paternity leave is as accepted as maternity leave ? even paternity leave supporters say that 's not likely . " from a cold hard political standpoint , for some reason , we just feel like you take time off and you 're a loafer , you 're a taker , ( a ) grabber , " said @entity93 . but as more @entity214 come forward and make decisions that they say are best for their families , maybe , just maybe , we 'll move closer to the approach of our friends abroad . @entity93 said , " in terms of just being socially good for everybody ... having kids raised in a loving family and to start them from the get - go with two involved parents ... i do n't see how that could possibly be bad and i hope that one day we can get there . " do you think men should be able to take paternity leave -- no matter their profession ? chime in in the comments or tell @entity232 on @entity233 or @entity127 on @entity73 .	@entity20:Major League Baseball	@entity28:Murphy	@entity29:New York Mets	@entity214:Daniel Murphys	@entity233:Twitter	@entity173:Ward Cleaver	@entity0:Esiason	@entity176:Europe	@entity73:Facebook	@entity232:Kelly Wallace	@entity37:Craig Carton	@entity39:WFAN	@entity105:Dad 's Book of Awesome Science Experiments	@entity97:Dad 's Book of Awesome Projects	@entity127:CNN Living	@entity125:Michael	@entity93:Adamick	@entity162:United States	@entity146:Robert	@entity180:Sweden	@entity183:Norway	@entity184:Spain	@entity40:Francesa	@entity94:San Francisco
prince @entity2 and @entity5 , @entity5 , kiss on the balcony of @placeholder	@entity49	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- prince @entity2 slipped a gold ring onto the finger of @entity5 friday , and the couple vowed to love , comfort , honor and to keep each other in @entity0 's biggest royal wedding in three decades . bells pealed over central @entity0 and flag - waving crowds roared in excitement friday as @entity5 arrived at @entity14 to marry @entity2 , the second in line to the @entity18 throne . @entity5 wore an ivory and white satin dress with lace sleeves and shoulders , designed by @entity22 of the @entity24 fashion house . royal wedding : the big day " you look beautiful , " the prince told her as she arrived at the altar on the arm of her father @entity30 . @entity2 wore the uniform of a colonel of the @entity35 , a scarlet jacket and blue sash , as his brother , prince @entity38 , accompanied him into the abbey . crowds cheered as his car drove the short distance from @entity43 to the abbey before the wedding , and they roared and waved as the newlyweds rode in an open carriage from the abbey to @entity49 after the ceremony . royal wedding : the dress a million people lined the wedding route , police said . the couple appeared before about half a million cheering supporters on a balcony of the palace and exchanged a quick kiss on the lips -- then pecked each other 's lips again a moment later . @entity65 jets then flew over the crowd and the palace in formation , the official climax of the wedding celebration . royal wedding : hats galore the prince and duchess went inside to a lunchtime reception for 650 people , hosted by @entity78 it featured an eight - tier wedding cake , the palace announced . they left about two hours later in an open - topped dark blue @entity82 with a license plate reading " @entity85 , " @entity2 at the wheel . the car is one prince @entity89 has owned since 1969 and had converted in 2008 to run on biofuel made from @entity92 wine wastage , his office announced . a search and rescue helicoper flew past as the newlyweds left the palace . the couple will be known as the @entity98 and @entity5 following their marriage , the royal family announced shortly before the wedding -- thus avoiding giving the newest member of the royal family any title that would implicitly compare her to @entity104 , @entity104 . the most devoted monarchists arrived days before the event and camped out with @entity107 on their clothes , tents and faces . some traveled from as far away as @entity112 . up to half a million people who did n't get one of the 1,900 invitations to @entity14 were expected to watch the event on giant screens at @entity118 in central @entity0 . @entity119 , queens , priests and politicians began to arrive at the abbey shortly after 8 a.m. , with celebrities such as sir @entity125 and @entity127 gold medallist @entity126 among them . @entity128 arrived with his wife @entity129 , with the soccer star sporting his @entity132 medal on the right lapel of his morning coat . medals are traditionally worn on the left . street parties are being held across the @entity18 , while protests threatened by @entity140 radicals , anarchists and anti-royalists largely failed to materialize . about 5,000 police officers are out on the streets , including 110 on horseback and 35 with sniffer dogs . @entity0 's @entity146 reported 45 arrests by the time the reception began , mostly for breaches of the peace . the world 's media have deployed even more resources than the police did , with at least 8,000 staff working in @entity0 for the event . @entity18 culture secretary @entity157 predicted the ceremony would be seen by an estimated 2 billion people worldwide . but the @entity18 themselves are lukewarm about the event , with just under half saying they were planning to watch it on television , and 56 % saying they were not interested . @entity2 announced his engagement to @entity5 in november after proposing secretly in a rustic cabin in @entity169 in october . he 's the older son of @entity89 and the late @entity104 , @entity104 ; a grandson of @entity78 ; a military search - and - rescue helicopter pilot and , by one recent measure , the most popular member of the royal family . @entity5 is an art history graduate and the eldest child of self - made millionaires who run a party - supplies company . widely known as @entity5 before her wedding , the bride has now asked that she be called @entity5 , the royal family said in the run - up to the wedding . they met as college students at the @entity184 in @entity185 , sharing an apartment with a circle of friends before they began dating . she first caught his eye when she modelled in a student fashion show wearing a see - through dress over her underwear , @entity18 reports have said . the couple married at @entity14 , where @entity18 monarchs are crowned , sometimes married , and often buried , alongside major figures from @entity18 history including @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 . the guests included " @entity207 " actor @entity206 , a personal friend of prince @entity89 ; and former @entity18 prime minister @entity209 . but the guest list is as notable for who was n't on it as who was . former prime ministers @entity214 and @entity216 were not invited , leading to accusations that the royal family favors the conservative party over @entity220 . @entity49 responded that @entity209 was invited not because he was a @entity221 but because he was appointed guardian of prince @entity2 and his younger brother @entity38 when their mother @entity104 died in a car crash in 1997 . @entity228 , a conservative and the other living former prime minister , declined the invitation . she failed to appear at a @entity233 event in her honor last year because of ill health . @entity237 president @entity236 also was n't invited , raising some eyebrows . the royal family explained that as a matter of protocol , presidents were not invited . the @entity237 ambassador to @entity0 was on the guest list , as were most members of @entity0 's diplomatic corps . but @entity248 's ambassador was uninvited just a day before the wedding in light of his government 's current crackdown on protesters . the @entity255 of @entity256 , whose country is also clamping down on demonstrations , was invited but on sunday decided not to attend . the controversies and the couple aside , the wedding was a very traditional @entity18 event in some respects . it included the @entity265 , hymns and @entity268 readings typical of @entity92 nuptials , and the always nervous moment when the priest asks that if anyone present knows of a lawful impediment to the marriage , he speak now or " hereafter forever hold his peace . " of course , the priest asking that question friday was @entity280 , the archbishop of @entity281 , the titular head of the worldwide @entity284 church . and while it 's not unheard of for @entity18 weddings to include a singing of " @entity289 , " this one was unusual in that the monarch in question was actually standing in the front row for it . @entity2 gave @entity5 a ring of @entity296 gold , but she did n't return the favour -- and she did not , in her vows , promise to obey him . of course , if @entity2 does some day become king , @entity5 will then presumably have to obey him . a @entity301 poll for @entity1 when the engagement was announced in november found that just over half of @entity18 adults thought @entity2 would make a better king than his father @entity89 , heir to the throne ; 58 % said @entity5 would make a better queen than @entity89 's second wife , @entity309 , the @entity309 . but the online poll 's 2,015 respondents were split on the largely theoretical question of whether the crown should actually skip a generation and pass directly to @entity2 when his grandmother @entity78 dies . forty - five percent said it should , while 41 % said it should not . @entity1 's @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .	@entity22:Sarah Burton	@entity98:Duke	@entity169:Kenya	@entity24:Alexander McQueen	@entity129:Victoria	@entity203:Isaac Newton	@entity82:Aston Martin	@entity85:Just Wed	@entity256:Bahrain	@entity127:Olympic	@entity112:Colombia	@entity89:Charles	@entity157:Jeremy Hunt	@entity119:Kings	@entity118:Hyde Park	@entity214:Tony Blair	@entity2:William	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity236:Barack Obama	@entity237:U.S.	@entity5:Duchess of Cambridge	@entity319:Stephanie Halasz	@entity318:Carol Jordan	@entity92:English	@entity78:Queen Elizabeth	@entity296:Welsh	@entity132:OBE	@entity126:Ian Thorpe	@entity30:Michael	@entity14:Westminster Abbey	@entity35:Irish Guards	@entity204:George Frederic Handel	@entity233:Downing Street	@entity38:Prince Harry	@entity43:Clarence House	@entity216:Gordon Brown	@entity18:British	@entity209:Major	@entity104:Diana	@entity268:Bible	@entity128:David Beckham	@entity107:Union Jacks	@entity265:Lord 's Prayer	@entity202:Charles Dickens	@entity201:Charles Darwin	@entity125:Elton John	@entity207:Mr. Bean	@entity206:Rowan Atkinson	@entity248:Syria	@entity221:Tory	@entity220:Labour	@entity146:Metropolitan Police	@entity301:ComRes	@entity140:Muslim	@entity228:Margaret Thatcher	@entity309:Duchess of Cornwall	@entity184:University of St. Andrews	@entity185:Scotland	@entity281:Canterbury	@entity280:Rowan Williams	@entity284:Anglican	@entity289:God Save the Queen	@entity65:Royal Air Force	@entity49:Buckingham Palace	@entity255:Crown Prince

sample local " fast food " in @entity25 , @entity14 , @placeholder , @entity26 or @entity183	@entity74	( @entity0 ) -- we know you do n't want to fly halfway around the world to eat a @entity4 but how about steamed cod with mustard sauce and chives , mixed vegetables , and parsley baby potatoes ? that , for instance , is what 's considered fast food in @entity14 . when we think of fast food in the @entity16 , we imagine mega-chains with thousands of restaurants around the world -- too many , in fact , for the brands to have much quality control . but in some countries , such as @entity25 and @entity26 , the concept is just catching on , and the quality of the food you 'll find passing as " fast " is all the better for it . dining at white - table restaurants abroad is certainly a treat of travel ( if you can afford it ) , but if you really want a glimpse into local culture , there 's no better way than sampling the fare residents grab on the go . of course , it does n't hurt that the meals are as tasty as they are cheap . here , then , are our picks for the best foreign fast - food venues overseas . @entity43 : see the restaurants . @entity25 : @entity45 @entity46 : @entity47 topped with a fried egg ; black beans , white rice , and @entity52 fries on the side ( 10 reals , or about $ 6.50 ) many older and traditional @entity25 frown upon eating food with their hands , so when the @entity45 chain debuted in 1981 and became the first quick - service restaurant to hand out steel knives and forks , it caught on quickly . @entity45 now has 358 locations across @entity25 . as at other fast - food joints , patrons at @entity45 pick up their orders from a counter , but food is usually presented on open plates , not in cardboard boxes , for guests eating in - house -- another acknowledgment of national preferences . @entity74 : mr. @entity75 @entity46 : beef noodle soup ( 13 yuan , or about $ 2 ) in @entity16 @entity79 restaurants , the menus are usually dominated by heavy fried - rice and lo - mein dishes , but in @entity74 simple noodle soup is the standard lunchtime fare . locals seem to especially love the options at mr. @entity75 , where patrons can customize their soup with condiments like dried - chili oil , soy sauce , white vinegar , and pickled greens . the soup is ordered from a counter and served in ceramic bowls , typically slurped standing up at the counter . the " @entity99 " chain was founded in 1987 by @entity100 , a @entity79 - @entity16 entrepreneur who previously created a chain of @entity103 restaurants in @entity104 . the late mr. @entity100 's face is now emblazoned on restaurant storefronts in a style similar to @entity108 at @entity109 . by 2010 , the homegrown chain had 400 locations in 19 provinces across @entity74 . @entity43 : 10 coolest small towns in @entity16 @entity14 : @entity114 @entity46 : the @entity115 , with steamed codfish fillets in a mustard sauce with chives , mixed vegetables , and parsley baby potatoes ( 8 euros , or about $ 11.50 ) while @entity16 do n't usually think of steamed fish as a fast - food staple , most of the menu at fish - buffet chain @entity121 is made up of precisely that . @entity128 , plaice , pollock , salmon , and other fish are the stars of the show ( patrons choose whether they want the items steamed , grilled , or fried ) . an emphasis is placed on fresh fish sourced from well - managed waters , catering to the @entity14 preference for healthy , sustainable food . the appeal , though , is more universal : the company , now with over 400 locations across @entity144 , is the @entity146 's largest chain specializing in seafood . @entity26 : @entity148 @entity46 : @entity149 rolls ; @entity150 ( 75 rupees , or about $ 1.65 ) and mixed vegetables ( 45 rupees , or about $ 1 ) are the two most popular fillings street - food stalls are a longtime standard in @entity26 , and most fast - food chains have struggled to compete there as a result . one of the first to break out , in 2004 , was @entity148 , which specializes in kaati rolls -- unleavened flat bread that 's been lightly fried and coated with egg , then stuffed with meat or vegetarian fillings and served with a side of fries sprinkled with tangy masala spices . ( typically , one roll counts as a snack , two as a meal . ) each @entity148 kitchen , restaurant , and kiosk has completely separate cooking and serving processes for vegetarian and meat dishes to accommodate local traditions . that kind of attention to detail may be why @entity148 caught on : the chain now has 15 locations , mostly in the city of @entity182 @entity183 : @entity184 @entity46 : @entity185 filled with red caviar or salmon roe ( 240 rubles , or about $ 8.30 ) founded in 1998 , @entity184 has spread to 111 restaurants and 80 street kiosks in @entity190 and @entity191 . while soups , porridges , and salads all appear on the menu , it 's really all about the blinis . these thin , triangular - shaped , wheat pancakes are wrapped around various fillings ( sweet or savory ) and are baked to order at the counter in front of your eyes . in the @entity16 , we 're not used to thinking of this tasty dish as a fast - food item , but in @entity183 it 's available all day and evening . down it with some kvass , a low - alcohol drink made from rye flour with malt , or else some @entity213 ( a half litre of honey beer ) . @entity43 : 10 popular travel scams around the world @entity218 : @entity219 @entity46 : the four - piece chicken meal ( mild or spicy ) with garlic sauce , @entity52 fries , and bread ( 12 riyal , or about $ 3.25 ) @entity219 was founded in 1974 in the @entity218 city of @entity225 and quickly became one of the most beloved fast - food chains in the @entity228 . ( you might have spotted the business - class travelers on @entity231 and @entity232 toting containers of @entity219 along with their duty - free shopping . ) its claim to fame is its breaded chicken , which is pressure fried to keep the meat juicy . the enterprise has 46 permanent locations , which might sound like small potatoes , but when you consider how sparsely populated the @entity245 is , that 's a huge accomplishment . the chain is so popular that the company operates a pop - up restaurant once a year in @entity249 ( @entity250 ) , which caters to hundreds of thousands of prayerful @entity251 a day while they attend @entity252 , a five - day religious pilgrimage that usually takes place in the fall . one passing observation : only men are allowed to work behind the counters , in deference to local custom . @entity261 : @entity262 @entity46 : " @entity271 grilled " kaya ( coconut jam ) toast with slices of butter , a soft - boiled egg , and a mug of kopi ( coffee ) ( @entity261 $ 2.50 , or about $ 2 @entity16 ) founded in @entity261 in 2005 , breakfast - and - lunch purveyor @entity262 now has more than 30 locations in the city - state and 12 elsewhere in @entity275 and the @entity276 , including @entity277 , @entity278 , and the @entity279 . but the dish it specializes in has been served locally by roadside kopitiams ( or coffee stands ) since the 1920s . @entity262 brandishes one major weapon in the toast - and - spread war against longstanding roadside rivals : it has its employees dress in blue - and - white striped caps and aprons -- a direct appeal to @entity261 ' delight in snappy uniforms . yet @entity262 wisely retains the familiar touches of a traditional kopitiam , such as @entity297 tabletops and natural wood decor . @entity43 : 12 restaurants with spectacular views @entity300 : steers @entity46 : rib burger and chips ( 32.95 rand , or about $ 4.50 ) when @entity305 's came to @entity300 in 1995 , locals laughed at its @entity4 ; those three ounces of meat looked pretty puny next to the offering from local chain steers : the @entity311 burger , which packs seven ounces of beef . in red - blooded , meat - loving @entity300 , offering burgers of that magnitude is a sure way to gain fans . steers has since maintained dominance as the national brand of choice , with 483 locations in @entity300 today . reminiscent of the @entity325 's chain in the @entity16 , steers provides quick service and comfort food in a sit - down setting , though its restaurants also have to - go and drive - through menus . burgers are the main item on offer , but pork riblets are a close second , served on a bun , as a rack , or as cut pieces . @entity43 : 7 most common gas - guzzling mistakes get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you @entity343 ! copyright ¬© 2011 @entity345 , all rights reserved .	@entity183:Russia	@entity26:India	@entity99:East meets West	@entity25:Brazil	@entity148:Kaati Zone	@entity149:Kaati	@entity250:Makkah	@entity251:Muslims	@entity115:Nordsee Plate	@entity114:Nordsee	@entity278:Malaysia	@entity279:Philippines	@entity276:Pacific	@entity277:Hong Kong	@entity150:Chicken Tikka	@entity271:Crispy	@entity311:Big Steer	@entity0:BudgetTravel.com	@entity213:Hmel'noy Med	@entity218:Saudi Arabian	@entity219:Albaik	@entity191:St. Petersburg	@entity190:Moscow	@entity52:French	@entity47:Hamburger	@entity79:Chinese	@entity75:Lee	@entity74:China	@entity121:Nordsee	@entity232:Qatar Airways	@entity14:Germany	@entity146:Continent	@entity100:Li	@entity245:Kingdom	@entity231:Emirates	@entity104:California	@entity128:Codfish	@entity108:Colonel Sanders	@entity109:KFC	@entity345:Newsweek Budget Travel , Inc.	@entity261:Singaporeans	@entity343:FREE-CLICK HERE	@entity249:Mina	@entity262:Toast Box	@entity144:Europe	@entity325:Denny	@entity300:South Africa	@entity297:Formica	@entity225:Jeddah	@entity275:South Asia	@entity305:McDonald	@entity228:Middle East	@entity182:Bangalore	@entity4:Big Mac	@entity184:Teremok	@entity185:Blini	@entity45:Giraffas	@entity46:Signature Dish	@entity103:Beef Noodle King	@entity252:Hajj	@entity43:Budget Travel	@entity16:U.S.
@placeholder 's government says it plans to pursue legal action against newspaper	@entity9	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- early editions of @entity4 's leading newspaper thursday displayed a large front - page photo claiming to be an " unprecedented " and " exclusive " look at @entity9 president @entity8 's medical treatment in @entity10 . but the intubated man lying in a hospital bed shown in the photo was n't @entity8 , the newspaper soon discovered , and it began backtracking . @entity15 took down the photo , which was on the newspaper 's website for about 30 minutes , and also recalled the early editions of its newspaper from newsstands . " after learning that the image offered did not correspond to @entity8 , @entity15 also stopped distributing the print edition and started to send a new edition to retail outlets , " the newspaper said in a statement on its website , explaining the retraction and apologizing to readers . @entity9 vp accuses ' infiltrators ' of murder plot against him @entity15 declined to comment on the matter to @entity1 . the newspaper 's online statement said the photo had been provided by an agency that claimed it was an authentic image of @entity8 . " the daily has opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of what happened and the errors that could have been committed in the verification of the photo , " the statement said . several purported photos of the @entity9 leader have circulated on social media in recent weeks , but @entity9 's government has n't released any new photos of @entity8 since he underwent cancer surgery in @entity10 more than six weeks ago . the 58 - year - old president has n't made any public appearances since then , either . the quick retraction by @entity15 did not quell sharp criticism from the @entity9 government and many on social media , who slammed the newspaper and said the photo was clearly taken from a 2008 @entity63 video that had nothing to do with @entity8 . @entity8 ally : ailing president undergoing physical therapy " as grotesque as it is false , the photo of ' @entity8 intubated ' that today the venerable @entity4 newspaper @entity15 published on its front page , " @entity9 information minister @entity68 said in a @entity70 post . later thursday , @entity75 said the @entity9 government plans to pursue legal action against the newspaper " so that these type of acts do not go unpunished . " " we will use all the legal tools within our reach to proceed to repair the damage caused not only to @entity85 , the president , but also to all of @entity9 society , " he said . the photo 's publication , @entity75 said , was evidence of a right - wing media campaign that aims to spread fear and destabilize @entity9 . he also objected to the nature of the image , arguing that the newspaper 's editors never would have permitted the publication of a similar photo of a @entity99 president or a member of their own families . @entity102 , head of @entity9 's @entity103 , said publishing the photo was no accident . " nobody believes that the photo that appears in @entity15 of @entity4 is something accidental , " he wrote in a @entity70 post , arguing that the motive behind the photo 's publication was clear : " hatred . " @entity114 president @entity113 also took to @entity70 to criticize the @entity4 newspaper , calling the photo a " dirty trick . " @entity118 was getting ready to open a bundle of newspapers as she set up her newsstand in @entity0 early thursday when she got word of the problem . " do n't open it . i have to take the newspapers , " @entity118 said a distributor told her . " there was a problem , and they have to change the front page . " nothing like that has ever happened before , particularly with the prominent @entity15 , @entity118 said . " it 's unbelievable , because with the number of filters it goes through , it is a little strange , truly , " @entity118 said . the newspaper provided additional details into its decision - making in an article posted online thursday night , titled , " the photo that @entity15 never should have published . " " the newspaper will revise its verification procedures in view of the errors committed , " the article said . but the @entity15 article also said that after being assured by a news agency that the photo was authentic and taken by a @entity10 nurse who had been part of @entity8 's medical team , @entity15 had no way to confirm details about when the picture was taken " due to the information restrictions under the @entity10 regime . " there was a lengthy debate among the paper 's editors about whether to publish the hospital photo , the newspaper said . " the conclusion reached was that the image was relevant at a time when the health of @entity9 president is a source of great controversy and heated political debate in his country , because of his absence during his inauguration and ... in light of the lack of transparency of the authorities , " @entity15 said . @entity9 army backs @entity8 amid uncertainty @entity1 's @entity183 reported from @entity0 . @entity184 wrote the story in @entity186 .	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Madrid	@entity68:Ernesto Villegas	@entity10:Cuban	@entity9:Venezuela	@entity4:Spanish	@entity184:Catherine E.

@placeholder has begun the rollout of a new feature , @entity4	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has begun the rollout of a new feature , @entity4 , which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire @entity1 community . similar in concept to @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity4 gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the " @entity17 " button on the homepage . questions is also available on friends ' profiles just as you would post on someone 's wall . we first learned of @entity1 's q&a feature two months ago , when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product . the world 's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to @entity1 's offices to meet with the q&a team . i had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several @entity1 employees . questions has several defining features : photo questions : for example , if you take a picture of a bird , but do n't know what species it is , you can post the picture on @entity4 and get your answer . polling : if you 're simply looking for the answer to " which city is better : @entity55 or @entity56 ? " , you can get your answer by creating a poll . tagging : the company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic . the goal seems to be to make @entity66 discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking , photography , @entity72 or a variety of other topics . topic exploration : @entity1 described this as a roulette - type feature that allows users to browse @entity1 's eventual mountain of @entity66 . under the " questions about " drop - down menu , there 's a feature called " everything " that allows users to browse the company 's catalog of questions . following : you can follow specific questions for updates and new answers . updated homepage : @entity4 does actually change the homepage , adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status , ask a question , add photos , or post a link . there was one more thing that @entity1 made clear to me : @entity105 is not an advertising product . while brands with @entity109 will eventually be able to answer questions , it 's not meant to be a promotional platform ; it 's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users . facebook questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today , but the company promises to " bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can . " the entire feature is public , so we do n't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on @entity1 . will @entity4 prove to be more useful than @entity11 or even @entity122 as a q&a platform ? we think so , if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all : 500 million users . ¬© 2010 @entity0 . all rights reserved .	@entity17:Ask Question	@entity1:Facebook	@entity0:MASHABLE.com	@entity12:Mahalo	@entity11:Quora	@entity10:Yahoo!

" we believe it to be ... a six - to 10 - ounce water bottle that was wrapped in black tape , " @entity0 police commissioner @entity22 told @entity1 on wednesday . he said the bomb 's powder may have come from fireworks components , including a fuse . the powder was placed inside the bottle in a way that made it " more powerful , " @entity22 said . he said a forensics unit is working on finding fingerprints . the homemade bomb , which went off around 3:30 a.m. , shattered glass , but no one was injured . the store was not open . police have said the device was planted under a wooden bench outside the coffee shop . " we have a witness who believes he saw two young people he describes as teenagers , both white males , " the commissioner said . one is described as blond , wearing a red shirt , and the other had brown hair and wore a gray shirt . @entity22 said the witness saw the two approach the @entity7 , then looked away . after the witness heard the blast , he said he saw the two young people run away from the building . @entity22 said that for now , it 's impossible to say whether the bombing was politically motivated .

several countries have disputed @placeholder ownership since first recorded landfall in17th century	@entity6	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 president @entity2 has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the @entity6 in the @entity7 , accusing the @entity9 government of blatant colonialism . known to the @entity11 as @entity6 , the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in @entity11 landed troops on the islands . in an open letter to @entity9 prime minister @entity20 and published in @entity9 newspapers thursday , the @entity11 leader said " @entity9 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity11 , thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity . " the @entity9 government was swift to respond , insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty " unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish . " it is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries . what led to the latest dispute ? the @entity11 president has raised the sovereignty issue several times over the last two years , including a claim at the @entity41 , but the dispute made global headlines when prince @entity44 , second in line to the @entity9 throne , was deployed on a military mission to the islands in 2012 . the @entity9 also decided to dispatch the new warship @entity50 to the @entity6 -- a move that inflamed anger in @entity11 which accused @entity9 of militarizing the @entity7 . tensions were raised again in december when the @entity9 renamed a portion of the @entity56 as @entity57 in honor of the @entity9 head of state @entity59 also has a claim on some of the territory and lodged a protest with the @entity9 . last year also saw a public confrontation between the two countries ' leaders when @entity67 tried to hand a letter to @entity20 at the @entity69 -- a letter he refused to accept -- and there was more bad feeling between the nations ahead of the @entity73 when @entity11 released a video boosting its @entity76 team that was filmed on the islands . where are the @entity6 and why are they important ? located in the @entity79 , about 480 kilometers east of the tip of @entity81 , the windswept @entity6 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources . their remoteness , however , exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among @entity9 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity11 interests . @entity11 's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820 , prompting @entity9 to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared in 1765 . falklands conflict in photos despite regular challenges , notably in 1982 , @entity9 control has endured and the @entity6 ' current population of about 3,000 looks to @entity0 to safeguard oil , fishing , farming and tourism incomes . what happened in 1982 ? documents recently revealed under the @entity9 's 30 - year rule show that the @entity9 government was surprised by the @entity11 invasion of the islands on april 2 , 1982 , with the then @entity9 prime minister @entity112 describing it as " the worst ... moment of my life . " in evidence given to the @entity116 in october 1982 , and some months after the war ended , @entity112 said there were no warning signs from @entity11 since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks . " i never , never expected the @entity11 to invade the @entity6 head - on , " she told the committee . " it was such a stupid thing to do , as events happened , such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing . " the files also show that @entity112 's @entity130 was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then @entity135 secretary of state @entity134 , while also preparing a military response . @entity9 naval forces were dispatched after @entity11 president @entity139 's military dictatorship put troops on the @entity6 . soldiers fought land battles on the islands , aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of life -- most notably the @entity11 @entity149 and @entity9 's @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity148 . @entity9 declared an end to fighting after 74 days and following the surrender of @entity11 troops . @entity11 put its death toll at 645 . @entity9 's civil and military losses amounted to 255 . how did the @entity135 and other world powers react ? president @entity159 's administration declared economic sanctions against @entity11 . it also gave its @entity163 ally a strategic edge by supplying potent @entity166 missiles to counter @entity11 's @entity167 . at the height of the conflict , a meeting of the world 's biggest economies -- including the @entity9 , @entity135 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity91 , @entity175 and @entity176 -- backed @entity9 's position . why wo n't the @entity9 give up the islands like it did @entity179 ? @entity9 acknowledges its claim to the @entity6 is disputed , but has made clear it has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue with @entity11 . professor @entity183 , an expert in maritime territorial disputes at @entity186 's @entity185 , said last year that there was no comparison to @entity179 , which @entity9 returned to @entity190 control after expiry of a set lease in 1997 . " the @entity9 position on the @entity6 is that they are under @entity9 sovereignty -- they are not leased from anyone , " he said . what has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982 ? spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect , @entity9 began taking renewed economic interest in the @entity6 . it protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licenses . it also stepped up its military interests , building a new airfield and bolstering naval , army and air force presences . images of life in the @entity6 cooperation between @entity9 and @entity11 -- by now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forces -- has improved , but @entity219 continued to reject any territorial claim to @entity6 other than its own . the @entity6 are due to hold a referendum on their political status on march 10/11 , 2013 . according to the @entity6 legislative assembly , the vote is intended to affirm islanders ' desire to remain a self - governing territory of the @entity9 and to reject claims of ownership by @entity11 . so why is the language between @entity0 and @entity219 so tense now ? analysts have previously pointed to @entity11 politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil , gas and electricity . " the government is being squeezed from lots of different areas , so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the @entity6 issue , " professor @entity242 , an expert in @entity244 politics at @entity245 in @entity246 said last year . " it 's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on . " in the @entity9 , @entity20 -- a successor to @entity112 as leader of the @entity261 -- must be seen to defend the principles of his predecessor who mobilized troops to reclaim the islands . @entity9 @entity6 conflict veteran @entity267 said : " it 's not about asserting a claim , it 's about allowing people of the @entity6 to have the right to self - determination . " what has @entity11 done to bolster its claims ? regional allies were recruited to the cause at the end of 2011 , with members of the @entity81 @entity279 trading bloc uniting to ban @entity6 - flagged vessels from their ports . this is largely " diplomatic dressing " that will do little to isolate the islands , professor @entity285 , who heads the @entity244 program at @entity287 in @entity288 , said last year . is this really all about oil ? partly . there is @entity11 resentment of a @entity9 oil exploration project launched off the @entity6 in 2010 . this has been worsened by @entity11 's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons . analysts , however , insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the @entity6 dispute . how much oil is there ? press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the @entity6 economic zone -- a radius of 320 - kilometers around the islands , but despite successful drilling , this quantity is still speculative . the figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures , including @entity317 and @entity318 & @entity319 , which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands ' @entity9 - backed government . attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the @entity3 dispute . many major oil firms have interests in @entity11 and are wary of upsetting @entity219 by involving themselves in the @entity6 . also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote @entity7 . professor @entity335 , a petroleum economics expert at the @entity336 , described the @entity6 oil reserve estimates as " optimistic , " adding that even if they are proven , the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive . " it 's one thing doing exploration , but when you come to development , we 're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there 's nothing there -- just sheep farmers , " he said . " it will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it , and there 's a number of ifs and buts before we get there . " is conflict likely again ? no , say analysts . while there are parallels with the 1980s -- politicians using @entity368 - @entity11 tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at home -- there is little appetite for conflict on either side . any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere . a former senior @entity9 military officer said in early 2012 that @entity9 military cutbacks had left @entity9 unprepared for another @entity6 conflict . @entity11 is apparently in a similar state , with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for @entity9 's depleted force . " even if @entity11 wanted to go to war , they have no military capacity , " @entity242 said . he said @entity67 's own antipathy towards the military -- a legacy of her political opposition to @entity11 's former dictatorship -- meant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of @entity9 vessels .	@entity20:Cameron	@entity149:General Belgrano	@entity81:South American	@entity159:Ronald Reagan	@entity139:Leopoldo Galtieri	@entity112:Thatcher	@entity279:Mercosur	@entity135:U.S.	@entity134:Alexander Haig	@entity151:HMS Antelope	@entity150:HMS Sheffield	@entity130:Cabinet	@entity335:Alex Kemp	@entity3:Anglo-Argentinian	@entity2:Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity7:South Atlantic	@entity6:Falklands	@entity317:Rockhopper	@entity176:Canada	@entity179:Hong Kong	@entity318:Borders	@entity9:British	@entity219:Buenos Aires	@entity190:Chinese	@entity50:HMS Dauntless	@entity79:South Atlantic Ocean	@entity56:British Antarctic Territory	@entity57:Queen Elizabeth Land	@entity59:Queen Elizabeth II.

@placeholder wants clarification on adoption of new ' anti-gay ' laws in @entity6	@entity10	soccer 's world governing body expects the 2018 @entity3 to be a catalyst for social change in @entity6 , despite apparently anti-gay statements by the head of the organizing committee . but @entity10 told @entity11 tuesday that it was seeking clarification on the adoption of new laws in @entity6 which " prohibit propaganda on non-traditional sexual relations " around minors . the legislation also bans symbols symbols such as rainbow flags and has led to calls for the @entity22 and the 2018 @entity3 to be boycotted . @entity23 , ceo of the latter competition , defended the new laws , saying they had been misinterpreted . " it is designed against active propaganda of homosexuality , not against homosexuality itself . that is a big difference , " he was quoted in an article by @entity33 . " would you like a @entity3 where naked people are running around displaying their homosexuality ? the answer to that is quite obvious . " " the @entity41 and @entity3 are not a stage for various views -- not for @entity44 , not for any other ways of life . it should be about football and nothing else . " @entity10 said that its statutes had " zero tolerance against discrimination based , among other , on sexual orientation " and trusted that the 2018 hosts would deliver on their promise to provide all visitors and fans with a warm welcome . " @entity10 is firmly convinced that the staging of the @entity3 can contribute to uniting people and having a positive social impact , " it added . the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , under pressure to act ahead of next year 's @entity64 , has publicly opposed any moves to stage boycotts , but told @entity11 it is keeping a watching brief on developments in @entity6 . " this legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented , particularly as regards the @entity70 in @entity71 , " it said . " to that end , the @entity62 has received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity6 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity70 . " @entity6 won the right to host the 2018 @entity3 at a vote in december 2010 and pledged to build 13 new stadiums as part of a near $ 5 billion plan . billions will also be spent on improving infrastructure for the expected influx of tourists and football fans for the global competition .	@entity3:World Cup	@entity22:2014 Sochi Winter Olympics	@entity33:World Football Insider	@entity6:Russia	@entity11:CNN	@entity23:Alexey Sorokin	@entity62:IOC	@entity10:FIFA	@entity44:Nazis	@entity41:Olympics	@entity64:Winter Games	@entity71:Sochi	@entity70:Games
@entity206 : it 's odd @placeholder @entity5 voted to kill @entity35 's @entity19	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- it 's always been a mystery to me why @entity5 lawmakers who denounce the evils of government choose to run for office . if your belief is that the private sector holds the answers to all that ails us , it seems like you would want to go out and prove the case . so the may 9 vote by the @entity18 @entity5 to eliminate the @entity19 , which collects statistics about the nation 's population , is confusing . doing away with the data collection would seem to commit two cardinal sins against the right 's ideology : make government less efficient and eliminate a critical tool for profit - driven business . you may not know the @entity19 as separate from the @entity32 census . while the census takes place once every 10 years , the @entity19 is an ongoing data collection survey administered by the @entity35 to provide more in - depth and current statistics about demographic patterns in @entity32 . this information is crucial if you care about smart direction of the $ 400 billion in annual state and federal grants to schools , hospitals , infrastructure projects and other critical services . the data derived from the survey provides guidance about how to divvy up best those hard - earned taxpayer dollars so that they are spent with as much care and precision as possible . apparently , that dynamic is lost on @entity32 rep. @entity54 , a @entity5 who beat @entity55 to win @entity57 's 8th @entity56 in 2010 . he introduced the amendment to repeal the survey as a way to make good on his campaign promise to " stop wasteful spending . " with the affirmative @entity18 vote , he hopes to save $ 2.5 billion over the next decade . here 's the rub though . if @entity54 gets his way , @entity32 will spend $ 4 trillion in that same time period with no data to guide the funds -- essentially shooting in the dark with a massive amount of money . that 's the antithesis of efficiency ; vastly more than $ 2.4 billion is likely to be wasted in the process . it seems that along with climate change and evolution , statistical science now appears to be viewed with suspicion by the tea party . i 've not heard an alternative : perhaps a dartboard with pictures of all the states on it ? the @entity5 claims the survey is intrusive . but i have to wonder if the vote to repeal the survey is just a step toward tea party @entity5 ' @entity90 of eliminating government spending entirely and with it , the $ 400 billion in annual disbursements . if that is the path forward , let 's look at where that road functionally leads us : without the @entity19 , we wo n't know where veterans are living , so we ca n't get them the financial assistance they 're owed for their service to our country . without the federal and state grants , we simply ca n't take care of them at all once they come home . without the survey , we ca n't know where there are pockets of uninsured people , so health care funds can be directed toward offsetting the costs of emergency room visits . without the state and federal grants , doctors will be forced either to let people suffer and die or raise costs on all their patients to make good on their @entity121 oath . without the survey , we wo n't know where @entity32 still lack flush toilets and therefore risk contaminating the groundwater we all drink . without the federal and state grants , we ca n't mitigate the impact of raw sewage on our water supply and prevent disease from spreading when our water gets tainted . @entity54 might say : " let the private sector take care of it . " on that point , we can agree : the private sector can and should play a larger role maintaining the health of our country . the flaw in that plan is that our business sector is very reliant on the @entity19 in making decisions about how best to serve their customers . that 's why trade groups , including the @entity32 @entity146 and the @entity147 have voiced their opposition to the @entity54 amendment . the data provided from the survey has informed everything from where to locate new stores to what kinds of products are popular with consumers . these trade groups are hardly a bastion for government expansionists , and their opposition to this bill reveals the critical wedge in the @entity5 coalition . the business - first wing of the party is all too happy to allow government to foot the bill -- in this case , for solid market research -- when it 's convenient for them . the small - government ideologues are more than happy to dismantle government piece by piece even when it harms business and creates bad spending strategies . when asked about the elimination of the survey , @entity179 economist @entity178 said , " if you 're opposed to the survey , you 're opposed to understanding what 's going on in @entity32 . " for this reason , it will be an uphill climb to get the measure to pass the @entity189 and get signed by the president . still , the initiative and the vote are telling . if knowledge is power and ignorance is bliss , eliminating the @entity19 will only pay dividends for those who live in powerful bliss . the rest of us would have to suffer through the mess being made of the informed and democratic process . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .	@entity189:Senate	@entity146:Chamber of Commerce	@entity32:America	@entity35:Census Bureau	@entity5:GOP	@entity179:MIT	@entity178:Jonathan Gruber	@entity0:CNN	@entity19:American Community Survey	@entity18:House	@entity147:National Association of Homebuilders	@entity57:Florida	@entity56:Congressional District	@entity55:Alan Grayson	@entity54:Webster	@entity90:Holy Grail	@entity206:Hogue	@entity121:Hippocratic

" only by empowering vast moderate majority can we turn tide against @placeholder . " says @entity229	@entity24	the recent video depicting the final words and beheading of @entity4 journalist @entity3 by someone that seems to be a @entity8 foreign fighter has sent shockwaves across the @entity9 . the video has already been blocked multiple times from various video - sharing platforms , only to reappear as many times , something that once again emphasizes that the new frontline for counter-terrorist practitioners is online extremism . labeled as a " message to @entity4 , " the video adds another line of fodder to @entity24 ' tech - savvy and social media - driven propaganda and messaging . the scene is filmed on a high quality device with seamless editing of president @entity30 's speech authorizing military action against @entity24 positions , something which it argues led directly to this , @entity24 ' brutal response . the answer to why @entity24 -- which refers to itself as the " @entity37 " ( " is " ) -- makes and popularizes such videos is simple : they represent a critical threat to the @entity9 on two levels . on the one hand , the video directly warns the @entity9 of repercussions if its intervention continues . on the other , it represents a more subtle threat reminding @entity48 and the @entity4 that their own citizens are vulnerable to being radicalized , that @entity24 supporters are present all over the world . in the past , most @entity24 propaganda had focused on the development of the caliphate state and on securing territories within @entity57 and @entity58 . the primary target audience had been @entity57 and @entity58 military forces and militias . so , creating an elaborate display of beheading an @entity4 represents a distinct change in messaging , turning the threat towards the @entity9 . the act is declared as revenge for @entity4 air strikes against @entity24 fighters in @entity58 . indeed , the apparently @entity8 militant conducting the beheading addresses @entity30 directly , declaring that any attempt " to deny @entity73 liberty and safety under the @entity76 caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people . " clearly , here @entity24 is attempting to strip @entity4 intervention down to the rudimentary " us versus them rhetoric " -- depicting the @entity9 , and specifically @entity4 , as a force that is continually trying to oppress @entity73 the world over . this is nothing new . in the @entity90 , " @entity89 , " @entity88 are referred to as " @entity91 , " linking present day events with historical events where @entity94 ( predominantly , but not exclusively , from the @entity9 ) have targeted @entity73 . as such , the @entity4 decision to commence military action in @entity58 based on humanitarian concerns , without the equivalent military intervention of other @entity100 political powers has played into @entity24 rhetoric against @entity4 . @entity24 knows that @entity4 military action is unlikely to change based on one video . however , by making this threat and demanding that the @entity4 stop military interference in the region , @entity24 gives itself justification for direct action against @entity4 hostages and potentially justifies action against the @entity4 directly . opinion : beheading video poses challenge for social media using an apparently @entity8 foreign fighter to carry out the beheading in the @entity3 execution video was a deliberate act perpetrated in order to create the maximum impact and gain as much @entity122 attention as possible . the use of what seems to be a native english - speaker in the video forces @entity122 viewers to recognize an individual who has wholeheartedly rejected his past , and who is committed to @entity24 ' cause -- willing to carry out the most abhorrent acts of violence in the name of its political program . @entity122 governments face an ongoing threat that their citizens will become radicalized and go abroad to fight in @entity57 and @entity58 . @entity140 , a fellow at the @entity141 for @entity142 , estimates that almost 3,000 foreign fighters have left @entity122 countries to fight in @entity57 . this is an unprecedented number , already far surpassing the number that left to fight in @entity147 during the previous 10 - year conflict . the success of @entity24 in promoting their cause and attracting fighters from abroad is a combination of an advanced social media strategy paired with a lack of counter-narratives . while @entity24 supporters handing out leaflets on @entity161 streets may gain more media attention , it is @entity24 ' online presence that is its most powerful recruitment tool . @entity24 has been a game - changer in terms of using @entity167 , @entity168 and its own online apps to engage with potential recruits , promote its victories and antagonize its perceived enemies . @entity167 feeds regularly depict an idealized image of a 5 - star jihad to draw in young potential jihadists , often mentioning the availability of young local women who are marrying @entity24 fighters . these same feeds also boast of " spoils " -- military weaponry and vehicles won in battle . violence towards the enemy is also a common theme , largely because it threatens those willing to stand up to @entity24 , something that cultivates intrinsic fear in future military and paramilitary personnel attempting to face the group . right now , we are woefully lacking in both online and offline content that stands up against @entity24 messaging . @entity197 needs to come from moderate theologians explaining why @entity76 does not condone the use of violence . other community voices must be louder in their arguments against the validity of a caliphate state . finally , governments must give a clear message about why they are intervening militarily in some areas , like @entity58 , but unwilling to act in others , like @entity57 . the extremist minority is exceptionally vocal and continues to overwhelm discourse on the validity of @entity24 and its actions , particularly online . only by empowering and activating the vast moderate majority can we turn the tide against @entity24 . would you watch the video ?	@entity24:ISIS	@entity88:Westerners	@entity89:Dabiq	@entity3:Foley	@entity4:America	@entity197:Counter-messaging	@entity9:West	@entity8:British	@entity219:James Foley	@entity57:Syria	@entity58:Iraq	@entity73:Muslims	@entity30:Obama	@entity37:Islamic State	@entity100:Middle Eastern	@entity147:Afghanistan	@entity94:Christians	@entity122:Western	@entity91:Crusaders	@entity90:ISIS English-language magazine	@entity161:London	@entity140:Aaron Zelin	@entity141:Washington Center	@entity142:Near East Policy	@entity229:Saltman	@entity168:YouTube	@entity76:Islam	@entity167:Twitter	@entity48:Europe
new : prime minister , president take in @placeholder basketball tourney game in @entity10	@entity9	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- president @entity2 gave a nod to @entity5 's heartland tuesday , saying in an interview conducted during halftime of an @entity9 basketball game in @entity10 he wanted to show his @entity13 counterpart , @entity12 , a part of @entity5 rarely seen by foreign visitors . " i thought it was going to be wonderful for the prime minister to have a chance not only to see a basketball game for first time , but also to come to the great state of @entity10 , because sometimes when we have foreign visitors , they only see the coasts , they go to @entity26 , they go to @entity0 , they go to @entity27 , but you know the heartland is what it 's all about , " @entity2 said . @entity2 's hat tip to @entity10 , and his choice of venue , may not be pure coincidence -- @entity10 is historically a key swing state in presidential elections . @entity12 and @entity2 flew together on @entity36 to @entity37 , @entity10 , to take in an opening game of the @entity9 basketball tournament . @entity2 , well - known as a basketball fan , was treating @entity12 to a little @entity41 , and the pair conducted the joint television interview at halftime of the game between @entity46 and @entity47 . asked how he thought the teams were playing , @entity2 replied candidly . " both teams are shooting terribly , " @entity2 said . " it may be nerves . these are not teams that normally end up coming to the tournament . " @entity12 , asked how he was enjoying watching his first basketball game , said he was " enjoying it , " and that @entity2 was explaining the ins - and - outs of the @entity5 sport . " he was giving me some tips , " @entity12 said . " he 's going to help me fill out my bracket . " @entity12 's trip to the @entity5 is intended to demonstrate that ties between the countries remain as close as ever . the @entity64 labeled @entity12 's visit -- which started tuesday and will include meetings with president @entity2 followed by lunch and dinner at the @entity64 on wednesday -- an official one , not a state one . that 's because the label of state visit is reserved for heads of state , and @entity12 is the head of government . @entity75 is the head of state . however , the @entity64 statement said @entity12 would attend a state dinner wednesday night , the sixth of the @entity2 administration so far . " the fact that we are hosting the prime minister in the manner that we are demonstrates the nature of the relationship between our two countries ; the fact that it is a special relationship , " @entity64 press secretary @entity87 told reporters tuesday . on wednesday , @entity12 and @entity2 will hold talks at the @entity64 and address a joint news conference , followed by lunch and , later , the @entity64 dinner with full diplomatic trappings and toasts . @entity12 and his wife , @entity96 , will leave @entity0 on thursday . " the visit will highlight the fundamental importance of the @entity5 - @entity13 special relationship and the depth of the friendship between the @entity5 people and the people of the @entity13 , as well as the strong personal bond that has developed between the two leaders and their families , " a @entity64 statement said . topics expected to come up at wednesday 's meetings include the coming @entity111 and @entity112 summits , as well as @entity113 , the @entity114 , @entity115 and the global economy , according to the @entity64 . in a joint op - ed published tuesday in the @entity118 , @entity2 and @entity12 emphasized the global benefits of the strong alliance between their nations . " the alliance between the @entity5 and @entity125 is a partnership of the heart , bound by the history , traditions and values we share , " the two leaders wrote . " but what makes our relationship special -- a unique and essential asset -- is that we join hands across so many endeavors . put simply , we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance . " troops and citizens of the two countries " have long shown what can be achieved when @entity13 and @entity5 work together , heart and hand , and why this remains an essential relationship -- to our nations and the world , " the commentary by @entity2 and @entity12 said . @entity1 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .	@entity26:New York	@entity27:Los Angeles	@entity115:Iran	@entity114:Middle East	@entity113:Afghanistan	@entity112:G-8	@entity111:NATO	@entity87:Jay Carney	@entity152:Lateef Mungin	@entity151:Stacia Deshishku	@entity118:Washington Post	@entity2:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity5:Americans	@entity9:NCAA	@entity10:Ohio	@entity75:Queen Elizabeth II	@entity13:British	@entity12:Cameron	@entity37:Dayton	@entity36:Air Force One	@entity96:Samantha	@entity125:Britain	@entity46:Western Kentucky	@entity47:Mississippi Valley State	@entity41:March Madness	@entity64:White House
@entity308 : @placeholder 's aftermath points up something about election issues	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- " rethinking grid dependence in new climate reality . " that was my sole tweet in the aftermath of @entity7 , sent after four long nights with my wife and daughter in our cold , dark living room , cut off from the infrastructure -- and the people -- that normally keep us going . indeed , in a reality where charging a cell phone requires finding a friend who not only admits to having power but also agrees to let you come over and plug into it , the relationship of self - sufficiency to community resources takes on a whole new meaning . and it reflects not only the core themes of the election , but also the main conceptual challenges facing our society at the dawn of the digital age : do i depend on the collective , or do i go it alone ? ' insane , ' ' inspiring ' @entity36 polling places in @entity7 's wake in the hard - hit areas of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and the unlucky suburbs , people who had their own generators , supplies , and wood stoves fared better than those of us depending on downed wires , closed supermarkets , and electrically ignited furnaces for power , food , and heat -- at least for a while . some offered extension cords from their homes , or even a spot on the floor to sleep . others nodded in acknowledgment when they heard of our misfortune , but offered no help -- as if they did n't understand that we were suffering from more than the inconvenience of no cable tv . their quizzical looks seemed to say , why should their own success -- but for the grace of @entity71 , in many cases -- obligate them to help others ? @entity75 : @entity76 still fighting for those who are hurting this all changed soon enough , when they lost the ability to find gasoline to power those generators , ice to keep the food cool , or dry firewood to burn . then they were out scavenging for resources like the rest of us . in my little world of media and technology , self - sufficiency had more to do with having chosen to keep copies of all of my work files , computer programs , and entertainment right on my own devices rather than depending entirely on the miracle of cloud computing . this meant that when my family finally evacuated our frigid home ( turns out fireplaces do n't make much heat ) , we could bring my book drafts and my daughter 's @entity110 movies along with us . i 'm no doomsday prepper , but i have always had reservations about relegating my files to the servers of others . when we finally arrived at the closest open hotel room to our home in @entity36 's suburbs -- it was downtown @entity121 -- we did n't bother with any of our technology , anyway . my daughter was excited to see and play with other kids -- families relocated by @entity125 from devastated parts of @entity45 , arriving at the hotel with dogs , hotel vouchers , and printed @entity131 maps . now that i was in a hotel lounge with working @entity133 , i really did n't care anymore about whether my work was getting done , or whether i could dazzle my @entity136 followers with any insights or witticisms about this whole mess . i did n't care about the election or about the @entity141 , or least of all about e-mails about work . @entity144 says help @entity36 restaurants : eat out , tip big instead , i sat in a hotel lounge with working @entity133 , and along with a half dozen dads my age , watched our childhood rock ' n ' roll heroes -- @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153 -- perform at a telethon over images that may as well have been our own neighborhoods : fallen trees , crushed homes , families wading through the floods . @entity161 came on and did a strange , acoustic version of @entity163 . there with my fellow displaced @entity7 victims , i realized that i , for the first time , was on the other side of the telethon . i was the one " sending out an @entity170 " although i had fared a lot better than the poor denizens of @entity173 or the @entity174 and i was n't going to be seeking a @entity125 reimbursement or need help rebuilding my home , i was still on the victim 's end of the equation . i was the person looking to be shared with rather than looking how to share ( or hoard ) what i had . with found time to rethink my approach to life and its inevitable disasters , zombie apocalypse scenarios playing out in my head , it became clear to me that the ideological divide @entity190 seems to be facing is a false one . those of us needing help were n't lazy or weak , and those in a position to provide it were able to do so only by virtue of collective resources . opinion : @entity200 , i 'll miss you the only home generators that worked all week , for example , irrespective of the long lines at the pump , were the ones that used natural gas , itself the product of the energy grid . the men getting in fights over the few available gasoline generators being sold out of the back of trucks at the local @entity216 ( as a 125 - pound intellectual , i did n't stand a chance ) may have proven their muscle , but ended up with at best three hours of heat before they went in search of nonexistent fuel . see , what we used to call the commons -- the resources and technologies used by everyone -- are what make individual success even possible . a shared resource like the @entity232 may allow great entrepreneurs to break from the pack to achieve wild success , but they need to continue to invest in the commons , not as a form of charity or penance but as a self - interested strategy for their own sustainability . or , put another way , the family that shares its electricity and living room with less fortunate storm victims will have more friends collecting firewood when the lights go out the next day . those of us who got hit hard will remember who was there with an open hand , and who was n't . as the checkout lady at the @entity263 said to me this morning , " it takes something like this for people to show their true colors . " then she added , with a smile , " at least now you know . " @entity45 lets @entity7 victims vote via e-mail people who managed to succeed in the crisis employed mixed strategies . they did make wise personal preparations -- such as wood stoves instead of ineffectual fireplaces , natural gas generators instead of gasoline ones , a good supply of stored food and water . but they also employed ones that showed an awareness of the need for infrastructure , the importance of longer term thinking , and the strength of community . our political parties make it out to be an irreconcilable distinction , as if @entity190 had to choose between one path or the other : greed or compassion , liberty or communism . but there is no choice . we do not choose between our personal success and our collective welfare . we do n't get one without the other . the storm that broke records -- and hearts the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity308 .	@entity125:FEMA	@entity110:American Girl	@entity153:Billy Joel	@entity152:Aerosmith	@entity151:Springsteen	@entity136:Twitter	@entity131:Google	@entity133:WiFi	@entity232:Internet	@entity170:S.O.S.	@entity173:Breezy Point	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Sandy	@entity174:Rockaways	@entity190:America	@entity75:LZ	@entity76:Obama	@entity71:God	@entity36:NYC	@entity216:Home Depot	@entity200:Jersey Shore	@entity263:A&P	@entity121:Philadelphia	@entity144:Anthony Bourdain	@entity163:Message in a Bottle	@entity161:Sting	@entity141:New York Marathon	@entity308:Rushkoff	@entity44:Queens	@entity45:New Jersey	@entity43:Lower Manhattan
@entity1 have long lived under a cloud of threats from @placeholder	@entity25	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- as winter recedes , winds whip through downtown @entity0 and chill the crowds of commuters on their way home . the sun is dropping and the pale golden light streams between tall buildings . a girl smiles as she chats excitedly on her cell phone . @entity14 suits cluster on a street corner debating their happy hour destination . nowhere is there the slightest inkling that anyone in this second largest metropolitan area in the world -- is fearful or even anxious about the stream of threats emanating from @entity25 . just as sure as spring is coming , most seem to find it entirely normal that warnings of thermonuclear war , annihilation and utter devastation punctuate this , the season of joint @entity28 , @entity1 military maneuvers . opinion : why @entity25 regime is scary " we are post-war , we do n't worry about that , " a journalist specializing in local news told me . " we take it for granted . " he was just one of about 30 reporters i met in a session discussing news in the @entity1 capital this week . @entity0 is a scant 30 miles from the demilitarized zone dividing @entity49 -- one of the most militarized places on the planet . if a full - scale war were to break out , the @entity1 capital would be @entity55 's prime target . it might only be minutes before artillery or rockets would come raining down . @entity25 has an array of artillery and other conventional arms that make its military a credible threat , especially to @entity1 . @entity55 is also believed to possess thousands of tons of chemical agents , although it has denied possessing such weapons . i wondered aloud if @entity1 really were n't afraid or simply felt there was nothing they could do about it anyway ? " we 're insensitive , " one offered in reply . it 's not the futility of fear in their predicament ; it 's that they have lived their entire lives under a cloud of threats and warnings from the @entity25 . " we know @entity25 does n't want war , " said another . " they want money and food , " adding that @entity55 has tried it all -- missiles , the nuclear threat , its million man army -- to try to blackmail the @entity1 . former @entity28 secretary of state @entity91 visited this week and told hundreds of people gathered for the @entity93 that @entity25 knew well an attack on @entity1 , much less the @entity28 , would mean a " regime ending " retaliation . he encouraged his mostly @entity1 audience to be optimistic because they were part of the world that has grown more democratic and wealthier , as opposed to the road chosen by the @entity102 family dynasty . rather than being burdened by the dark clouds of threats , @entity91 urged them to pursue jobs and human dignity , to focus on the environment and poverty reduction . what 's @entity111 up to ? @entity1 seem overwhelmingly willing to take that advice . in the week i 've been here , i have only found one woman who remembers participating in civilian air raid drills . " it was 30 years ago , " she told me . today , @entity0 's 25 million people have absolutely no ambition to live in constant fear . but @entity0 is n't all of @entity1 . " it 's different for us than people on the islands , " one told me , recalling the attack in 2010 that killed four @entity1 on @entity122 island barely outside @entity25 's territorial waters . in @entity0 , the prospect of war is unthinkable . but in a select few flashpoint areas , the threat of armed provocation is very real , indeed . @entity1 nightmare : experts ponder potential conflict i paused on a street corner near @entity2 's @entity0 offices and looked up at the jagged peaks rising behind the @entity139 , which is the @entity1 's presidential office . if missiles ever did come streaking toward the @entity1 capital , they would likely arc above those mountains . the nearest shelter , i thought , would be the subway system . i considered how long it would take me to get there , even if i were lucky enough to see them still short of their targets . my calculations were n't at all comforting . then , like about everyone around me , i decided to think about something else . @entity155 : what are your views on @entity25 's threats ?	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:South Koreans	@entity0:Seoul	@entity55:Pyongyang	@entity25:North	@entity93:Asian Leadership Conference	@entity28:United States	@entity102:Kim	@entity14:Men in black	@entity139:Blue House	@entity91:Powell	@entity111:Kim Jong Un	@entity122:Yeonpyeong	@entity49:North and South Korea	@entity155:iReport
but the coalition loses in @placeholder as a scandal hurts the @entity49 party	@entity47	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- election results in four major @entity1 states friday marked a momentous comeback for the country 's ruling @entity7 - led coalition , although it was undercut in one state by backlash against a graft - tainted coalition member . analysts say the good showing for prime minister @entity15 's coalition is a much - needed boost for the government , battered by a series of corruption scandals , rising inflation , and low investor confidence in @entity23 's third largest economy . in the eastern state of @entity26 , more than three decades of communist rule came to an end as the @entity7 led by populist leader @entity28 won a landslide victory . the @entity30 of @entity1 also lost its strong hold in the southern state of @entity33 . analysts say the left 's @entity36 economic policies seem increasingly outdated in the world 's second - fastest growing major economy . the only remaining red state in @entity1 is @entity41 in the northeast , with a scant population of 3.6 million people . meanwhile , in the southern state of @entity47 , the federal coalition was defeated as its key ally , the @entity49 , lost its political monopoly . the @entity49 party has been badly hit by a multibillion - dollar telecoms corruption scandal that has cost the country up to $ 31 billion , according to a government audit . the man at the center of the scandal , @entity58 , is a @entity49 member and former telecoms minister . he was arrested last month for his alleged involvement in the selling of telecom licenses at rock - bottom prices . " the @entity49 party has institutionalized corruption in @entity47 for years and their defeat clearly shows voters will no longer tolerate corruption , " said political analyst @entity64 of the @entity65 . @entity47 's chief minister and the head of the @entity49 party , @entity71 , resigned after his party 's defeat . @entity71 's daughter and @entity49 lawmaker @entity75 also faces charges for her alleged involvement in the telecom scandal . a court will is expected to decide whether @entity75 will be sent to jail on saturday . " for the longest time , local elections in @entity1 were fought along caste or religious issues , " @entity64 said . " but now people are awakened , they are saying no to politicians or political families who have dominated for so many decades . " analysts say these election results are crucial as the coalition will be in a better position to act on long - awaited reforms such as a new legislation on land acquisition . they say the regional elections could be considered a referendum ahead of the national elections in 2014 .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:India	@entity0:New Delhi	@entity7:Congress alliance	@entity23:Asia	@entity28:Mamata Banerjee	@entity36:Marxist	@entity30:Communist Party	@entity15:Manmohan Singh	@entity33:Kerala	@entity47:Tamil Nadu	@entity41:Tripura	@entity58:A.

sailed north to @placeholder in the @entity118 @entity117 and as far south as @entity119	@entity116	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 van der @entity1 was born to be on the water -- and after witnessing decades of incredible sailing innovations , the renowned photographer now feels like he 's an " astronaut of the sea . " " it 's more like space travel and i love it , " the @entity7 says of yachting 's extraordinary technological progress over the past 30 years . while he has n't quite had to reach for a helmet and suit , the boats which van der @entity13 now sails on are light years away from those which he used to frequent as a youngster . the @entity21 competition , in particular , has taken advantage of innovative materials such as carbon fiber and @entity25 , which were used on the @entity26 and the @entity27 , to create futuristic racing machines . " when i started racing large sailboats offshore , the sails were made of @entity31 , one click up from canvas , " van der @entity1 told @entity0 . " the masts were built of aluminum or wood , and the hulls were built of aluminum or fiberglass . " today it 's all about carbon - fiber boats -- lighter , stiffer , faster -- and the spars ( used in rigging ) are taller , skinnier , stiffer and smaller sections . " the sails are laminated , made of carbon or @entity25 , have perfect shape , keep their shape for longer periods of time , have a wider wind range and most importantly are much lighter and easier to handle . " @entity50 der @entity1 made his first real foray into the world of sailing photography after taking part in the 1981 @entity55 -- an event now known as the @entity57 . a keen sailor as a child and teenager , the sea was a second home to the @entity7 , who was brought up in @entity63 , @entity64 . while working on commercial fishing vessels and maintaining race boats , van der @entity1 spent much of his spare time sailing -- crossing the @entity69 more than 10 times as well as racing in several other events . but it is that race some 33 years ago which is etched into his memory -- a relic from sailing 's past which gave little clue as what was to follow . " when i did the @entity55 race it was an adventure ; the same race is now a business run by professionals and sailed by well - paid professionals , " he recalls . " if you want to see a change in sailing , look at the @entity21 . the boats they now sail are so extreme , very cool , but talk about light years from just 10 years ago . " then the top speed of the boat was about 15 miles per hour and nowadays they 're hitting 50 mph . " foiling 72 - foot catamarans with wing masts , space - age stuff built of all carbon , now that 's a change in what was yachting . it still is but it sure does n't look and feel like it . " after being approached to take photographs by @entity107 during the 1981 race , van der @entity1 soon discovered he possessed a talent few others could equal . the thrill of combining his love of sailing with his penchant for photography has taken him as far north as @entity116 in the @entity118 @entity117 and as far south as @entity119 . now living in @entity120 , @entity121 with his wife and three children , van der @entity13 has continued to produce some of the most beautiful images that the sailing world has seen . his new book " sailing , " which includes nearly 200 color photographs and five gatefolds of panoramic images , showcases work from across the globe . " i 'm so lucky to do a job i love , " he says . " i 've had some wonderful experiences . " there are times where you are barely afloat and have the gales blowing . there have been some scary moments , but to get the pictures you have to go through all of that . " if you stay at home you wo n't get those photos . " the advances in technology have not only helped the experienced professionals -- the amateur photographer is now better equipped than ever . smartphone cameras and dslrs make taking photos easier than ever , and van der @entity1 believes these developments can only be good for photography in the long run . " we 've come a hell of a long way since film , " he adds . " the change has been radical and has not only dramatically changed photography for the professionals but brought it to the masses as well . " everybody now shoots be it with smartphone or a dslr . the pictures are better , sharper , better color , no grain , super sensitive in low light -- you can shoot by candle light if needed . " you can blow up the images to the size of a billboard and to top it all off it 's so much easier to do . " the tools we have today make for much better photography for everyone , and i love it .

@placeholder does n't have any answers for the discrepancy , official says	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity3 on wednesday will report that while the number of suicides in the active - duty force declined in 2010 , the number of suicides in the @entity6 and @entity7 increased , a senior @entity3 official said . the increase in @entity6 and @entity7 suicides is among troops who are in the @entity14 and not activated for duty . the senior @entity3 official said more than half of those troops were never deployed to a war zone . the official said one possible explanation for the increase in suicides is economic pressure and rising unemployment , but he emphasized that the @entity3 simply does not have answers . the official noted that for @entity24 personnel who live as civilians back in their communities , the @entity3 is not able to provide the same type of suicide awareness and prevention programs that are available to active - duty personnel . the decline in active - duty suicides , even though slight , may be initial evidence that those awareness and prevention programs are helping , the official said .	@entity3:Army	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity7:National Guard	@entity6:Reserve	@entity24:Guard and Reserve	@entity14:United States
@entity17 refugee @entity3 enjoys festivity of first @entity19 @placeholder dinner	@entity9	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 scoops mashed potatoes and peas onto her plate , not quite sure of the history behind her first @entity9 meal . but she knows how thankful she is to be at a church in @entity0 this november , lining up for turkey , stuffing and pecan pie . @entity3 took a break to enjoy a @entity9 meal with fellow refugees . three years ago she grabbed her son , now 12 , and fled @entity17 . her husband , a carpenter who worked for @entity19 , had left for the market one day in @entity21 and never returned . @entity22 says she knows he is dead , even though she has never seen his body . when the rest of her family started to receive death threats , she felt she had no choice but to run . @entity22 and her son , @entity28 , made it across the border to @entity31 and later entered the @entity19 , two of more than 15,000 @entity17 refugees to be allowed in since the beginning of the war in 2003 . the @entity9 meal , served at the @entity37 to dozens of refugees from far - flung places like @entity40 and @entity41 as well as @entity17 , is a welcome break for @entity22 , who is struggling to build a new life . unable to translate her skills as a @entity21 salon owner into a job as a stylist , @entity22 does not have the money to pay $ 625 due in rent . " i have an electricity bill to pay , i have no job , " she says . " i have no way of knowing what to do . " government and aid group assistance to refugees does not last long . @entity22 plans to ask an aid group , the @entity57 , for more help , but she 's not sure what else she can do . soon she hopes her 21 - year - old daughter will arrive from @entity31 and bring with her better luck . " my daughter is coming and hopefully i will work , " she says , as @entity63 dancers in elaborate costumes entertain the diners . across the room , more and more refugees line up for the potluck dinner . " do n't worry , there will be enough food , " a man tells his two daughters , asking them to wait patiently . the man , @entity75 , and his wife , @entity76 , hoped , like so many immigrants before them , that the @entity19 would help them find a better life for them and their children . but the couple , who asked that their identities be protected for fear of reprisals against their family and friends still in @entity17 , are considering ending their @entity19 dream after three months of struggle . college - educated and proficient in @entity93 , @entity76 and @entity75 were shocked that the skills that provided them a comfortable living in @entity21 , as a mechanical engineer and lab technician , are of little advantage in an increasingly competitive @entity19 job market . they spend much of their day at the @entity57 office in @entity0 , searching for employment , but are considering returning to @entity105 , where they say they can find work , albeit illegally . " i am worried that i will be thrown out on the street , " @entity76 says . " my @entity111 neighbors could n't find work and they were evicted and thrown out on the street . we are worried the same will happen to us . many refugees we know have not found work and they have been here for eight months to a year . " until 2007 , very few @entity17 refugees were resettled in the @entity19 . for 2008 , the @entity121 administration set a goal of accepting 13,000 @entity17 . most of the estimated 2.2 million people who have fled @entity17 since the invasion are in @entity31 and @entity105 , many living illegally . their presence is straining infrastructure and social services there and driving food and housing prices higher . far from the warmth of the @entity9 party , another @entity17 refugee has managed to find work at a supermarket seafood counter , helping customers with their requests for jumbo shrimp and crab cakes . " i am like a manager , " says @entity141 , with a glimmer of pride in his eye . " i thank @entity146 that i have a job and that i am lucky . " @entity141 , who also asked that his identity be protected , was a college - educated artist and shop owner in @entity21 . he fled @entity17 with his wife and three children after he was run off the road and shot in the side on his way home from work . a friend who was with him died in the assault . @entity141 is now able to support his family with the aid of food stamps and hopes that his wife will find a job to help out financially . nevertheless , he has been able to afford internet service for his children and a car . that kind of @entity19 dream is all @entity22 wants as she stands at a bus stop , bundled in her head scarf and winter coat , the music and laughter of the @entity9 dinner now just a distant memory . she is on her way to the local farmers market , where she plans to spend the morning waiting in line with 40 or 50 other people hoping to work . @entity22 says she has hope . " i wish for my children to be like [ the @entity19 ] , " she says in @entity183 . " i wish they would have their own car , home , job -- to be @entity19 .

@entity192 : " @placeholder " deserves praises for its unflinching portrayal	@entity185	( @entity0 ) -- the image of @entity3 's body hanging from a tree -- noose around his neck , hands tied behind his back , feet barely touching the ground -- is uncomfortable to look at . and @entity9 , director of " 12 years a slave , " does not spare the audience with an expedient exit . there is no overbearing soundtrack to drown out the sound of him gasping for air . for what feels like an eternity , @entity9 makes us watch . he makes us listen . he makes us know the truth about slavery in a way no @entity25 film in recent memory has . the beatings are not brief . @entity28 is not spared . there are no scenes of white heroes racing against time to save him or undo the injustice that is being done . as he hangs there , we hear the birds singing . we see the sun fading . we feel the fear coursing through the body of a slave who risks her own life just to bring him a sip of water . the film shows unflinching moments that shed an unflattering light on something our culture prefers to gloss over , perhaps as a way of healing . just like calling people who point out racial inequality " race baiters " is supposedly an effective way to move on . oh , we 're willing to talk about slavery . but we like the stories told like " @entity59 " : inspirational , with redeemable characters and very few scenes of actual slavery because , well , that 's a downer . because of this , @entity9 's @entity65 nomination for best director is welcomed , @entity69 's performance as @entity70 worthy of praise and the best picture nomination for " 12 years " deserving . and yet , in one important way , something is missing . for if the @entity65 were held today and " 12 years " won best picture -- as some favor it to do -- it would be one of the lowest - grossing winners of the award ever . with proceeds just a hair under $ 40 million since its october release , it would join " the @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " @entity87 " and " @entity88 " as the only best picture winners not to crack the top five at the box office . to put this in perspective , the latest @entity92 in drag movie made more in less than a month . there is a chance that could change , because historically , there is a surge in interest in movies that are @entity65 darlings . even " the @entity85 " -- the lowest - grossing best picture winner to date -- enjoyed an 11.9 % increase in box office receipts after @entity65 nominations were announced . when the film won best picture , it jumped 13.6 % from the week prior to the win . perhaps in anticipation of a similar increase in demand -- and on the heels of a best drama win at the @entity117 -- @entity118 is reportedly planning to bring the movie to 500 more theaters this upcoming weekend , with the goal of raising the total to 1,000 in the next two weeks . before the @entity117 , " 12 years " was in only 114 theaters . the film will be in position to make more money . the question is : who will go see it ? because word on the street is that " 12 years " is an unapologetic portrayal of our ugly past , and @entity135 prefer our history with some nips and tucks . even now , as we are about to celebrate the birthday of the rev. @entity140 , we prefer to talk about the impact of his dream while limiting the mention of the nightmares that gave birth to that dream . how many of us will pay to see the scathing truth when refuge in fantasies are far more comforting ? how many of us are ready for a film whose narrative is not dominated by white protagonists but rather a free black man who , in 1841 , was kidnapped , tortured and sold ? to see " 12 years " is to find out that " nigga " as a term of endearment is a misguided delusion . to see " 12 years " is to see the full story of what those who fought under the shadow of the @entity164 flag gave their lives to keep . to see " 12 years " is to see that the claim that the black people who picked cotton in the field with the star of " @entity172 " were " happy " is a racist insult . the movie is an unsanitized portrait of a nation 's shameful past . it is two hours of breathing in the @entity179 and then walking out of the theater trying to pretend the stench is all gone . there is no question that " @entity185 " was the best picture of 2013 . but as the box office receipts show , not many of us are ready for that kind of honesty . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .	@entity25:Hollywood	@entity28:Christianity	@entity117:Globes	@entity88:The Artist	@entity85:Hurt Locker	@entity86:The English Patient	@entity87:Amadeus	@entity135:Americans	@entity118:Fox Searchlight	@entity3:Solomon Northup	@entity0:CNN	@entity179:antebellum South	@entity9:McQueen	@entity192:Granderson	@entity59:Lincoln	@entity70:Northup	@entity172:Duck Dynasty	@entity92:Tyler Perry	@entity140:Martin Luther King Jr.	@entity164:Confederate	@entity185:12 Years a Slave	@entity69:Chiwetel Ejiofor	@entity65:Oscars

" she gave me two @entity10 , i listened to them and i started to sing the high notes . i started to hear the orchestra and the emotion -- and the power to express so many different feelings through voice , through instruments , through feelings . that was the beginning . this talent i have got , i had to develop it , because it was a burning flame in my heart . when it started , i knew . i do n't know how to explain it . maybe different people feel that with love -- you just know it ! i felt that with music and opera . @entity34 , @entity35 , there are so many great @entity37 singers , but from my little town in the north , i think i was the first one . i come from @entity40 in the north of @entity37 . the city i am from is called @entity43 . my parents are very proud of me and so are other people in our little town . so i worked through the summers so i could get professional singing lessons and then i got into the music academy in @entity51 where i studied for six years . when i finished at the music academy , @entity53 from the @entity54 heard about me from a critic . he sent me an email ( saying ) that he wanted to hear my voice and from that moment on everything changed . i do n't know the details about what the critic wrote -- it must have been something that made him curious . more from @entity66 : @entity68 's first female olympic gold medalist @entity67 the difference between one singer and another is of , course , the talent he or she got from nature . the color of the voice , yes you could say that , but the most unique thing , the thing that makes a difference , is sincerity . it 's not that easy to open yourself to the audience -- to be sincere , to open your soul , to say , " this is me with my talent , my insecurities , with everything i am . this is me . " of course , technique is important too , but there are lots of singers with good technique who do n't take enough time , maybe , to develop the other part -- the sensitivity . my technique is not perfect all the time -- if i am not sleeping enough or having problems and too many thoughts . you ca n't force your voice to sound the same all the time because lots of exterior things influence your resonance and your energy , and all that feeds into your voice . the voice is a very sensitive instrument . it 's not that easy , it 's not just going out there and singing and your voice comes out . it would be so easy if it was like that . can you imagine how hard it is without a microphone to have the force and the power to sound through an orchestra of 80 people playing loud music ? that 's not normal , right ? you have to be patient and focused and to love what you do and to understand there are lots of moments where you feel very down . as an opera singer you have to understand that going through those rough moments is part of the lesson , of development , of enrichment . going through those moments , you can learn to inspire yourself . i inspire myself when i have to interpret a role where the character is very sad or very depressed . i think what i am doing to project that sound is connecting with something beyond this world . i just take a breath , and try to focus on one point . i ca n't push the sound out ; it feels more like i 'm just connecting myself with the universe . there are lots of times where i feel depressed or lonely or misunderstood and different . i do n't have a normal life with family or a partner who can help me from time to time . more from @entity66 : top designer @entity152 shares secret of staying in vogue the most interesting thing ( is ) that we always work with new people -- new conductors , new musicians , new partners -- on a new repertoire or a new role . this is the most beautiful thing that keeps me awake and makes me discover more of myself , to want more . you can compare being an opera singer with being an athlete : both have to practice a lot to focus on the distance . i also have to somehow know when i can hold myself back to maintain energy . some days i practice three , four , five hours , it depends . some days i 'm just reading , going through the score . we are in the most beautiful and the most known theater in the world , @entity176 in @entity177 . great musicians , great tradition -- opera was born here . i 'm so happy to be here , i could cry with gratefulness and joy for the emotions i feel . it 's more than a dream -- it 's that the most pure desire i had in my heart that came true .	@entity67:Nicola Adams	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Ileana Cotrubas	@entity34:Virginia Zeani	@entity37:Romanian	@entity10:Maria Callas CDs	@entity176:La Scala	@entity195:La Boheme	@entity177:Milan	@entity192:Hartig	@entity43:Bistrita	@entity53:Ioan Holender	@entity51:Cluj	@entity40:Transylvania	@entity68:Boxing	@entity54:Vienna State Opera	@entity66:Human to Hero	@entity152:Lydia Maurer
@placeholder described by @entity51 as greatest guitarist of his generation	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 is tired . he 's wet . but he 's standing outside the concert in the rain smoking a cigarette and talking cheerfully to fans after an energetic performance in @entity0 . the long queue of admirers , many from overseas , is testimony to his fame , but if truth were told , most of them just want to meet the lead guitarist from @entity18 . and if they were disappointed that @entity3 did n't play any songs written during his time in the multi-million - selling @entity23 band , the fans do n't let on . well , not much anyway . what @entity3 serves up for most of the concert in the atmospheric beachside @entity27 venue is a cacophony of white noise in keeping with the storm lashing in off the ocean outside . with up to four guitars , bass and drums , @entity3 is not an act for the faint - hearted . but melodies do shine through : occasionally on older songs such as " @entity39 " and the finale " @entity40 , " the volume eases for him to show what an interesting voice he has , one that was criminally under - used on the seven @entity18 studio albums . @entity3 's virtuoso musical talent on guitar is also richly on show -- he has been described by @entity52 songwriter @entity51 as the greatest guitarist of his generation . many of the songs are from his new album @entity57 , which marks a return to a rockier sound than his previous , more acoustic work . @entity3 seems in his element as a front man : his between - songs chat is limited to an occasional " cheers " but he seems to be having a scream . towards the end he lets his hair down by doing his famous back - flip and plays guitar with his teeth and behind his back . there 's no showing for favorites such as " @entity77 , " off the most @entity18 - like album " @entity78 , and while there are half - hearted calls for @entity3 's big @entity18 hit " coffee and tv , " it 's never going to happen . while he will always be defined by that band -- who reform again for the @entity88 closing concert in august -- @entity3 has now produced eight solo albums and is entitled as much as @entity90 is to a life after , or even alongside , @entity18 .	@entity3:Coxon	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:England	@entity0:Brighton	@entity27:Concorde 2	@entity23:Britpop	@entity39:All Over Me	@entity18:Blur	@entity52:Oasis	@entity51:Noel Gallagher	@entity40:Tripping Over	@entity78:Happiness in Magazines	@entity88:Olympic Games	@entity57:A&E	@entity77:Bittersweet Bundle of Misery	@entity90:Damon Albarn
republicans , who will take control of the @placeholder in january , are upset with the maneuver	@entity5	as they make a final push to approve presidential nominations before @entity3 take control of the @entity5 , @entity0 said tuesday the confirmation of a record number of federal judges was evidence they were right to make controversial changes to filibuster rules , despite objections from @entity3 . " yes , " senate majority leader @entity13 responded loudly when asked if still believes he was right to employ the so - called " nuclear option " a year ago in order to clear a backlog of nominees . the no. 2 @entity5 @entity18 explained that at the time there was a " breakdown in the relationship between the executive and legislative branch . " " if you just look at where we were , with all of the nominations stacked on the calendar , most of which had been reported from committees with overwhelming bipartisan votes , " sen. @entity24 said . " republicans were trying to keep as many nominations from final approval as possible . so we had no choice . " during the first year of the congressional session , before the nuclear option , the @entity5 confirmed a total of 36 federal district and circuit court judges appointed by the president . after the rules changes , which took place nov. 21 , 2013 , the number of judges confirmed more than doubled to 84 . the rules change lowered the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 , making it much easier for @entity0 , who currently have a 54 to 46 majority , to approve judges to those lifetime positions . before the @entity5 adjourns , probably in the next day or two , democrats hope to confirm an additional 12 district court positions . democrats this week also cleared a new surgeon general , a top immigration official , and were ready to approve tuesday the no. 2 at the @entity62 . each of those people faced serious @entity3 opposition and might not have been cleared if not for the rules change . " the train is running over everyone . that 's the @entity13 train . last trip around the track , " complained sen. @entity70 , @entity71 about the last minute wave of judicial and executive branch nominations @entity74 is jamming through . " it 's a result of the nuclear option which deprived us of our ability to advise and consent and it 's shameful . @entity70 and other @entity3 also blamed sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , and a small group of other conservatives who forced a weekend session that @entity13 used to clear procedural hurdles on a number of nominees . " it was also caused in part by what happened last weekend when several nominees who are controversial are now going to receive @entity5 votes and are probably going to be confirmed who otherwise probably would not have been , " said sen. @entity91 , @entity92 .	@entity3:Republicans	@entity0:Democrats	@entity13:Reid	@entity5:Senate	@entity24:Dick Durbin	@entity62:State Department	@entity70:McCain	@entity18:Democrat	@entity82:Ted Cruz	@entity83:R-Texas	@entity74:Senate Democratic Leader Reid	@entity71:R-Arizona	@entity92:R-Maine	@entity91:Susan Collins

@placeholder backers get @entity198 late this month ; it 's on sale to everyone in june	@entity1	@entity0 needed $ 950,000 from @entity1 in less than a month to make her dream of an affordable , free - to - play gaming console a reality . she got it in eight hours -- and nearly $ 8 million more after that . " it was the opposite of ' @entity13 , ' " said @entity9 , a gaming - industry veteran and former vice president at @entity11 . " it was , if you come , we will build this . " and so was born @entity0 , a $ 99 console that 's shaped like and is just a hair bigger than a @entity20 . it runs on @entity24 's @entity23 operating system and requires developers to offer a version of their games for free . @entity1 backers will be getting their @entity29 later this month and they 'll go on sale to everyone else in june . speaking here at the @entity34 festival , @entity9 said she got the idea for @entity0 ( pronounced @entity36 ) in response to a video - game industry that to her had grown stale . no new consoles were announced at last year 's @entity41 gaming conference by the big three console makers ( @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 ) . in recent years , almost all the most hyped and popular games have been sequels . and the rise of mobile gaming has been limited , turning video gaming into a solitary exercise rather than the social one she remembered growing up . " the tv is the best screen for playing games , " @entity9 said in an interview - style keynote with editor @entity56 of tech blog @entity58 . " i remember growing up , playing with my sister ... i feel like we 've lost that . i want to bring back the world of tv gaming . " for gamers , the strength of a console often boils down to the games they can play on it . to that end , @entity9 said 7,000 developers have signed up for @entity0 accounts , from big publishers who create multi-million - selling titles like " @entity77 " down to the smaller independents . the only requirement , she says , is that the game must be free or offer a free trial before the player has to buy it . how the game will make money -- whether it 's through ads , in - game purchases or sales after a free trial -- is up to the developer . " you should n't have to pay so much money to try out a new game , " she said . " we believe that every single game you should try before you buy . " during the hour - long interview , @entity56 pushed @entity9 on whether the @entity0 , which will have @entity99 of @entity100 and run on an @entity102 3 chip , will be powerful enough to run the kind of immersive , expansive shooters that have made big gaming releases as lucrative as blockbuster movies . her answer came in two parts . " yes , " she said . " and why would we ? " those experiences are great on those devices . you would n't want to play those games anywhere else . but we are going to have exclusive games . ... we 're going to have inventive , creative , exciting content that no one else has . at $ 99 , it 's not an either - or decision . " @entity9 said some top developers will be reworking popular titles for the @entity0 . others , some of whom have never made games before using @entity23 , are crafting new titles , she said . " we 're going to have our version of those games , but it 's going to be different , " she said . " we will have a first - person shooter ... game that you are going to want to play for hours on end . " @entity0 also has partnered with game - streaming site @entity135 , meaning that some graphic - intensive games could be playable on the device via the cloud . throughout its development , @entity0 has been open to its public , inviting them to help make suggestions . when backers pointed out on @entity146 that the color - coded buttons on the console 's controller were no good for color - blind players , @entity0 replaced them , making the four buttons correspond with the @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and a in its name . an ethernet port was added when some backers outside the @entity158 said they had no access to @entity160 , and a usb port was added for the " hardest of the hardcore " players who will want to store more games than the console can handle . increasingly , gaming consoles are becoming all - in - one entertainment hubs for the living room , and @entity0 will try to compete in that arena as well . the company already has partnerships with @entity172 and @entity173 and is in talks with major players like @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity24 . " we 're pretty confident we 're going to have ( that content ) at launch or close to launch , " @entity9 said . between now and then , she 'll be focusing on two goals . " we want you to love it , " she said . " and we want it to work .

@entity9 's @placeholder investigates seven months of online transactions	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- the suspect in @entity3 's terror attacks bought chemicals and tools on @entity6 that helped him kill 77 people this month , according to a @entity9 newspaper . the @entity10 , which said it investigated thousands of online transactions over a seven - month period , has reported that @entity13 used @entity6 to procure sulphur powder , which the newspaper described as a key ingredient for the bomb that exploded in @entity17 , killing eight people . the @entity19 also said that @entity13 , under the username " andrewbrei , " used @entity6 to order a drill press vice , a full - face respirator and a " hazmat " suit . in addition to the @entity17 bombing , @entity13 is accused of opening fire on @entity29 , killing 69 people on july 22 . @entity6 did not respond directly to the @entity10 report , but released a statement that made reference to the @entity3 attacks and said that the company is working with local authorities .

" @entity13 , who is being held in solitary confinement at @entity52 , near @entity17 , mentioned @entity6 repeatedly in his purported 1,500 - page manifesto that rants against @entity54 and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks . the author of the manifesto described how he used @entity6 to procure various items , some of which were not discovered during the @entity10 investigation , suggesting @entity13 could have had more than one @entity6 account , the newspaper reported . " @entity6 is not the best place to look as it is mostly civilian body armour available . but now and then , some inexperienced sellers simply make a mistake and list high grade mil spec armour and some times , @entity6 is unable to stop the auction in time , which allows you to ' swoop in and pick it up ' with a winning bid . i finally managed to buy 2000 usd worth of plates , " the manifesto author wrote . at another place in the manifesto , the author told his readers : " @entity6 is your friend .

general : " @entity41 is present in @placeholder "	@entity8	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity4 army and police are cracking down in an " anti-terror " operation in the @entity8 area of @entity4 , state - owned media reported on tuesday , as reports emerge of @entity12 's doctor surfacing in the area . police said they found hand grenades , machine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and ammunition in the operation that targets @entity8 " terror cells " suspected in attacks on a gas pipeline to @entity23 and a police station in the border town of @entity26 . one person was killed and 12 were arrested on monday , the first day of the operation , said @entity29 , a police officer involved in the offensive . citing an unnamed security official , state news agency @entity31 said authorities are targeting 15 more people who participated in attacks at an @entity26 police station -- some of whom are members of the extremist @entity40 , which is affiliated with @entity41 . the crackdown comes amid new developments on the whereabouts of a @entity12 associate . @entity47 , the doctor of the @entity49 leader , escaped from a @entity0 prison during the @entity4 revolution earlier this year and has resurfaced in the country 's @entity8 area , an official said . " @entity47 , also known among his fellow jihadists as the ' chemist , ' escaped from a maximum security prison in @entity0 on january 30 while serving a life sentence , " maj. @entity54 from @entity55 told @entity1 monday . according to prison records , @entity47 was sentenced to life for a " military case " -- but more details were not immediately known . @entity12 's longtime personal doctor and an explosives expert , @entity47 was born in @entity4 in 1952 . he left for @entity66 to join @entity41 , according to the data listed in his prison records .

" for neighboring @entity23 , the lack of state authority in @entity8 is becoming a source of anxiety . @entity23 prime minister @entity93 told a @entity95 committee recently that @entity4 was having difficulty exercising its sovereignty over @entity8 . " what 's happening in @entity8 is that global terrorist organizations are meddling there and their presence is increasing because of the connection between @entity8 and @entity102 , " @entity93 said . since the beginning of the revolution , the gas pipeline running through @entity26 used to export gas to @entity23 has been bombed five times by unidentified men . several police officers were kidnapped and killed in recent months , but no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks . on july 29 , several dozen people were demonstrating outside the @entity115 mosque in @entity26 after friday prayers . @entity117 , who was among the protesters , recalled what happened that day . " the @entity121 stormed in by the hundreds mounted on pickup trucks and motorcycles waving black flags , a symbol of @entity127 , " he told @entity1 from a safe house not far from @entity26 . " the militants were heavily armed with machine guns , hand grenades and rocked - propelled grenades . " the head of security in @entity8 , gen. @entity134 , told @entity1 that @entity135 had become active during the revolution that led to the ouster of president @entity138 . " the terrorists were joined by members of @entity142 factions , and they are currently being questioned by military intelligence . we arrested 12 assailants , including three @entity142 , " @entity134 said . " the investigation resulted in troubling information . @entity41 has been funding and recruiting cells in @entity8 including members of the @entity81 joined by @entity142 from the @entity82 , " @entity54 said . @entity151 smugglers who control the majority of underground tunnels into @entity102 were not happy to learn that @entity142 were among the attackers . @entity155 , one of the tunnel operators , told @entity1 , " i charge $ 50 to smuggle them in for trade purposes in coordination with @entity160 on the other side . after the attack we have banned any @entity142 from coming through . we are trying to bring peace to the area and do n't need trouble .

" while a middle aged man strummed a guitar . @entity26 rock music played through an amplifier that another protestor had wheeled into the road . on the periphery of the group stood a wiry man in a woolly hat , with the rainbow flag of peace wrapped around his waist . @entity37 was handing out flyers and speaking softly to interested passers - by . of all the criticisms leveled at @entity6 , its elite nature is the biggest gripe . like other such pow - wows of the powerful , the lack of access to this minute sphere of massive influence has in past years stirred up visible dissent around the venue itself . at the height of the @entity54 in 2012 , protesters even camped in igloos near the heavily fortified conference center . @entity6 this year was oddly quiet though . like the bitter cold that can often grip this mountain resort in january , protests were noticeable by their relative absence . there was a small group from @entity63 attempting to draw attention to their predicament on friday , but little to really catch the eyes of the delegates safely cocooned behind the venue 's ring of security . @entity37 's disparate group had been gathered via the internet , but while they had made it to @entity6 they were still a long way from the action . " this is the only thing that was possible , " @entity37 said . " it is absolutely taboo to go further towards the center where the people ... are meeting from the @entity2 . " i asked him why he and his fellow protestors were here . just like the delegates at the other end of the street , growth and inequality were on his mind too . " the 2015 goal is to halve extreme poverty , " he told me , " but we do n't talk about ( the fact ) that we have to halve extreme riches as well . " @entity37 's primary concern was for the long term impact of growth . the flyers he handed out quoted the economist @entity100 : " anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist . " " the planet is limited , " @entity37 told me . " in 30 years or in 70 years we have four times more cars , pollution , resources that are exploited , and future generations ' family will have nothing . " he had been at @entity6 the entire week , and had been coming to the town for the past 12 years . " this evening i will make another gathering , " he told me . he planned to make what he called a " thought stone " representing @entity2 organizer @entity118 . " mr @entity118 ( is ) a very important person in @entity6 , but actually we are all the same , including the animals and the plants , " he said . why had @entity37 left his protest until the end of the week , and not staged it while the @entity2 was in full swing , i asked . " most of the people still have to work during the weekdays , so saturday is the easiest way for people ( who are not from ) @entity6 to come here .

the @entity3 - controlled @placeholder rejects a balanced budget amendment	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity3 - controlled @entity2 on friday rejected a balanced budget amendment to the @entity5 -- a setback to @entity3 leaders and conservative activists who claim the measure is necessary to end the federal government 's spiraling deficit spending . a total of 261 members voted for the measure --- 23 votes shy of the two - thirds majority required for passage -- while 165 members opposed it . most @entity3 supported the measure ; most @entity20 voted no. the vote on the amendment was agreed to by both parties over the summer as part of the agreement raising @entity0 's debt ceiling . @entity20 leaders , however , are vehemently opposed to the idea , arguing that it would force the government into an economically destructive cycle of massive spending cuts . sponsored by rep. @entity34 , @entity35 , the measure would have required three - fifths of both chambers of @entity38 to sign off on any future deficit spending . the amendment 's requirements could have been waived in the event of a declaration of war . " the @entity45 people are demanding action , " @entity34 said earlier this month . " they know that it is crucial we rein in the skyrocketing deficit spending that is discouraging investment and threatening to bankrupt our nation . " shortly before the vote , rep. @entity52 , @entity53 , called @entity38 " hopelessly addicted to excessive spending and budget deficits " and said opponents of the amendment " are hopelessly in denial , just like a drug addict is in denial about their addiction . " @entity52 's comments prompted a retort from rep. @entity66 , @entity67 , who said , " i am addicted to saving lives . i am addicted to making sure that @entity69 is not violently cut by the balanced budget amendment . " minority whip @entity71 , @entity72 , also blasted the proposal on the @entity2 floor , accusing @entity3 of engaging in political posturing by pushing measures like the balanced budget amendment while failing to support spending plans that would actually bring the government 's finances under control . " do n't talk about it . just do it , " @entity71 said thursday . " do n't cut taxes and increase spending . do n't just preach fiscal responsibility . practice it . it will take no courage to vote for this amendment , but it will take courage to balance our budget by paying for what we buy . " despite the proposal 's defeat , it remains heavily favored by the public . nearly three in four @entity45 favored passage of the amendment in a july 18 - 20 @entity1 / @entity100 , while only 24 % were opposed . sixty percent of @entity45 believe a balanced budget amendment is necessary to get the deficit under control , according to the poll . the @entity2 passed a balanced budget amendment in 1995 , but the measure fell one vote short in the @entity108 in both 1995 and 1997 . @entity1 's @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .	@entity3:GOP	@entity2:House	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity35:R-Virginia	@entity34:Goodlatte	@entity5:Constitution	@entity45:Americans	@entity38:Congress	@entity69:Social Security	@entity20:Democrats	@entity53:R-Louisiana	@entity52:Fleming	@entity100:ORC International Poll	@entity110:Deirdre Walsh	@entity66:Jesse Jackson Jr.	@entity67:D-Illinois	@entity71:Hoyer	@entity108:Senate	@entity109:Virginia Nicolaidis	@entity72:D-Maryland
dismal quarter pushes @placeholder into recession , prompting snap elections	@entity0	@entity0 began voting sunday in parliamentary elections described by prime minister @entity2 as a referendum on his flagship economic policies . @entity2 called for the snap election last month , following news that the country had unexpectedly slipped into recession , dealing a blow to his much - vaunted " @entity10 " -- the stimulus and economic reform package he introduced since taking power in 2012 . " the election will be held to ask the public whether we will ( move ) forward with @entity10 or end it , " @entity2 said when announcing the closure of parliament in november . recent polls have shown that @entity2 's @entity21 has a strong lead over the main opposition party but turnout is expected to be low . strange timing an election was n't required until late 2016 , which has led to considerable speculation as to why @entity2 , with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early . @entity34 @entity33 , analyst and founder of @entity36 , a @entity37 - based government policy consultancy , said he found the timing " puzzling . " " why call an election when you have such a dominant position ? " indeed , polls suggest that a majority of the public do n't understand why @entity2 is calling an election at this time , and are critical of the decision to incur the cost during another period of recession . voter turnout is expected to be low . polls put support for the ruling ( @entity21 ) at around 30 % , with between 10 % and 13 % support for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , the main opposition party . the @entity21 has been in power nearly constantly since 1955 . during this period , the @entity53 have only governed twice , briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012 . read more : @entity0 @entity58 @entity2 's election gamble puts policies on the line @entity61 ultimately , @entity2 's election gamble will pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his economic policies will benefit ordinary @entity0 . while a key component of @entity10 has been extra government spending , a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers . in a bit to boost his election fortunes , @entity2 delayed a sales tax hike planned for october 2015 . his special adviser on economic affairs , @entity77 , has called for a further $ 25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy . but it 's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters .

nearly 8,000 @entity46 men and boys were slaughtered in @placeholder	@entity49	the @entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 , who is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart @entity7 , showed no remorse as his war crimes trial opened wednesday , at one point even appearing to threaten victims in the court . the former general drew his hand across his neck as if cutting a throat while staring at victims of the war that introduced the phrase " ethnic cleansing . " at other times , the man accused of being " the @entity23 " stared at them , fire in his eyes , and he once growled at the survivors . the 70 - year - old former @entity29 general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992 - 95 war . his trial is taking place at the @entity38 for the former @entity7 in @entity0 , @entity1 , a special court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war . prosecutors say @entity3 's campaign included the massacre of 8,000 @entity46 in the @entity48 town of @entity49 . on wednesday , prosecutor @entity50 laid out details of the case against @entity3 , saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war , but a specific aim of the @entity29 leadership . he will set out to show that @entity3 was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces , who were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed @entity48 . sexual violence was a weapon of war , @entity50 said , describing a woman who said she had been raped more than 50 times , and women who were forced by @entity29 forces to perform sex acts on members of their own families . prosecutors will use survivor testimonies and video clips to make their case at a trial that is likely to last for months or years . among those in the courtroom were the families of @entity49 victims . " victims have waited nearly two decades to see @entity3 in the dock , " @entity82 , senior counsel in the @entity83 at @entity84 , said ahead of the trial . " his trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice . " 2011 : @entity3 captured @entity3 's trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month , when another international tribunal found former @entity98 president @entity97 guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring @entity101 's notoriously brutal civil war . @entity97 got a final chance to address his court wednesday as @entity3 's trial opened , and he said he was " saddened " by a verdict that he portrayed as unfair . " both trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account , no matter how senior their position , " @entity84 said . @entity3 eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in may 2011 , when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern @entity117 . @entity119 's highest - ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment , according to a government minister . though he was carrying two handguns , he surrendered without a fight . he was extradited for trial in the @entity1 . but from day one in custody , he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies . before the trial that started wednesday , he also drew a finger across his throat in court , a gesture aimed at some of the @entity49 widows . at other times , he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea . he has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health . in july 1995 , @entity3 was in command of the @entity29 army and led his soldiers into the town of @entity49 . in the days that followed , the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 @entity46 men and boys . @entity48 peace negotiator @entity154 once described @entity3 as " one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer . " in the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of @entity7 , @entity3 rose rapidly through the ranks of the @entity7 army . in 1991 , he served as a front - line commander spearheading @entity117 forces in a yearlong war with @entity164 . by the time he took to @entity48 's battlefields , he had become a hero to many @entity167 , seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes . in may 1992 , @entity48 's @entity117 political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their @entity46 enemies who clamored for independence . @entity175 : @entity48 's future is tied to justice @entity3 wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of @entity180 , cutting the city off from the outside world . @entity117 forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions , trapping @entity180 's ill - prepared residents in the valley below . more than 10,000 people , mostly civilians , perished . some observers conjured images of @entity180 in describing @entity190 attacks on the besieged city of @entity192 earlier this year . as the war ended in the fall of 1995 , @entity3 went on the run . shortly after @entity3 was sent to @entity0 last year , authorities nabbed former @entity198 rebel leader @entity197 . he was the last @entity7 war crimes suspect at large . @entity29 wartime leader @entity200 was arrested in 2008 . and @entity117 president @entity201 was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed .	@entity23:Butcher of Bosnia	@entity29:Bosnian Serb	@entity117:Serbian	@entity82:Param-Preet Singh	@entity83:International Justice Program	@entity84:Human Rights Watch	@entity119:Europe	@entity154:Richard Holbrooke	@entity3:Ratko Mladic	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Netherlands	@entity0:The Hague	@entity7:Yugoslav	@entity198:Croatian Serb	@entity197:Goran Hadzic	@entity192:Homs	@entity190:Syrian	@entity50:Groome	@entity38:International Criminal Tribunal	@entity101:Sierra Leone	@entity98:Liberian	@entity97:Taylor	@entity175:Robertson	@entity201:Slobodan Milosevic	@entity200:Radovan Karadzic	@entity167:Serbs	@entity164:Croatia	@entity180:Sarajevo	@entity46:Muslim	@entity48:Bosnia	@entity49:Srebrenica

" whether he was killed or not , i hope @entity37 is watching the news closely , " @entity3 blogger @entity40 said before @entity8 's death was confirmed by @entity9 's governing @entity42 . she said she hopes the @entity3 opposition will get international support -- if not necessarily the military intervention that @entity48 gave @entity9 's revolutionary fighters . " the support we need is sanctions against @entity37 and boycott of @entity37 's regime and acknowledgment of @entity3 's ( opposition ) national council , " she said from @entity51 , where she fled in the face of threats in @entity3 .

" @entity37 must understand that the only scenario left for him , other than stepping down , is what happened to @entity8 . " regional expert @entity70 agreed that @entity8 's death could have " ripple effects " in the region , spreading the way the @entity25 did .

" @entity29 manned and unmanned aircraft played a key reconnaissance role in the @entity1 operation even after @entity29 forces stopped taking the lead combat role . and @entity47 spokesman @entity46 told @entity2 that he was expecting the mission would be suspended rather than canceled . " to cancel it , in these circumstances , i do n't think was the right decision , especially at this time , " he said , citing the continued presence of @entity51 elements . interim prime minister chosen @entity5 's move comes after the @entity18 @entity3 last week rescinded its march mandate for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti-regime protests . @entity61 , the @entity29 ambassador to the @entity18 , said @entity5 's mission puts @entity1 on a path to freedom . but she tempered her remarks with a word of caution . " we 're very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of @entity1 society , and in which the rights of all @entity1 people are fully and thoroughly respected , regardless of their gender , their religion , their region of origin , " @entity69 said after the @entity3 vote last thursday .

" i can not defend this case in the way he wants me to , " @entity16 told in session . he would not elaborate . @entity15 was found dead in a @entity23 hotel room registered to @entity2 in may 2010 . police say @entity2 took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to @entity28 , where he was arrested a few days later . @entity4 authorities have yet to file formal charges against @entity2 , who is expected to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on june 8 . once the discovery phase of the case ends , prosecutors will file charges and a trial date will be set . @entity16 has been defending van der @entity2 on a pro bono basis and said he expects a public defender will be assigned to the case . he said the lack of payment did not play a role in his decision to quit . " i thought this case would be a good opportunity to show the world that in @entity4 detainees are abused , and the @entity4 justice system is very informal , " he said . and he said he will continue to represent van der @entity2 in a related habeas corpus case claiming human rights violations during his arrest -- a case that would be thrown out if @entity16 withdrew from that case too . @entity16 threatened to quit the case once before after complaining of receiving threats by phone , e-mail and @entity60 . the 23 - year - old van der @entity2 was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of @entity63 , who vanished at age 18 while on a graduation trip to the @entity67 island of @entity68 . he was arrested twice but never charged in connection with her disappearance . shortly after his 2010 arrest , a federal grand jury in @entity10 indicted him on charges that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from the @entity63 family . @entity2 offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of @entity8 's remains in exchange for the money , according to the charges .	@entity2:Van der Sloot	@entity15:Flores	@entity0:CNN	@entity10:Alabama	@entity28:Chile	@entity4:Peruvian	@entity23:Lima	@entity63:Holloway	@entity16:Altez	@entity68:Aruba	@entity67:Caribbean	@entity95:Sloot	@entity8:Natalee Holloway	@entity60:Facebook
as an @entity2 agent , he worked on the @entity58 bombing and the @placeholder case	@entity60	( @entity0 ) -- a former supervisory @entity2 agent has been arrested and jailed on child pornography charges . @entity4 was taken into custody and charged monday after a nationwide undercover investigation of illegal child porn images traded over the @entity8 . the 54 - year - old resident of @entity10 , @entity11 , has pleaded not guilty and has a detention hearing in federal court wednesday . a federal complaint alleges 30 graphic images and video were found on @entity18 's laptop computer late last week when @entity2 agents searched his home , about 23 miles north of @entity21 . the arrest was a result a months - long probe , said the @entity26 attorney for the @entity27 of @entity11 , @entity25 . " the mission of our @entity31 initiative is to investigate and prosecute anyone found to ( be ) engaged in the sexual exploitation of children , " @entity25 said in a news release . " no matter who you are , you will be brought to justice if you are found guilty of such criminal behavior . " @entity18 is currently an @entity40 visiting professor , according to his online resume . he is director of training at the school 's @entity43 , but all references to his work have now been removed from the university 's website . there was no indication from the school as to whether it had suspended him . calls to the university and his @entity21 attorneys were not immediately returned . he had been an @entity2 special agent from 1983 to 2008 , serving as a bomb technician . he worked on the @entity58 bombing and @entity60 investigations , according to his university biography . a separate @entity63 profile filled out by @entity4 says he is an " accomplished investigator with more than 25 years of experience in @entity2 major case management , counter terrorism investigations , bombing prevention , post blast investigations and public speaking . " according to the criminal complaint , a federal - state joint task force had been investigating an @entity73 man allegedly trading child porn images as far back as september 2010 . that suspect was arrested in january , and a search of his computer reportedly led to @entity4 , who was using the e-mail name pedodave69 . according to the affidavit , an e-mail from that account was sent to the @entity73 suspect last fall , along with nine images of child porn .

he arrived to the @entity46 about 10 years from @entity70 , @placeholder	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) a proud laborer from @entity4 , @entity5 picked fruit in the orchards of @entity8 , but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year . he fell into deep despair . he could n't work or send money to family in @entity4 , two routines that shaped his life . it was this misfortune that distressed @entity5 in the days before he and police in the town of @entity0 clashed in february , in a confrontation that ended with officers firing a total of 17 bullets , hitting @entity5 several times and killing him . he was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks . his killing is now cited by family and @entity29 activists as another national example of officers using excessive lethal force against unarmed men , often minority men . the police shooting of @entity5 , 35 , now haunts his family , due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on @entity42 by bystanders . " @entity50 , " as loved ones called him , was one of 16 children , and he migrated to the @entity46 about 10 years ago to join other relatives and harvest food on farms , said his mother , @entity52 . that police fired 17 bullets at one of her 16 children leaves the mother aghast , she said . " my son was a happy person , a hard worker and he got along with his siblings , " the mother said last week in an interview with @entity2 en @entity60 shortly after a funeral service for her son at @entity0 's @entity63 . " i had not seen him in 10 years , but i would talk to him over the phone , " said the mother , who traveled to @entity0 from her rural home in the central @entity4 state of @entity70 for her son 's funeral . " i felt good that he was here . he was happy , and as a mother that was good for me , " she said . it was at a funeral home where the 60 - year - old @entity5 saw her son for the first time in a decade . more precisely , what she saw was his body . she almost fainted . " imagine so many years without seeing him and to come and see him in this situation . for a mother , it 's heartbreaking , something you never hope for or want to happen to your children , " @entity5 said . the video of officers gunning down @entity5 keeps playing over and over in the minds of the family . the tape shows @entity5 running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot . police have said that @entity5 was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by police . he then allegedly stoned two officers , and police resorted to deadly force , authorities said . officers had used a taser on him , but it was n't effective , police said . from what the mother has seen of the video , she noticed her son is n't shown throwing rocks . " i do n't see him throwing rocks . the only thing i can see is that he 's running , he raises his hands and they still shoot him . why ? i ask myself . why ? " @entity5 said . " and when he falls , they still handcuff him , and that is what hurts me the most . " @entity5 ' family said his limited @entity126 left him unable to understand the officers ' commands , shouted in @entity126 . more than half of @entity0 's 68,000 residents are @entity29 . of the 71 sworn officers in the police department , 12 are certified as fluent in @entity60 , a spokesman said . @entity5 now wants justice for her son . " i ask for justice to be done because it 's not right what they did to my son , " @entity5 said . @entity140 , an aunt of @entity5 , also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events , she said . " we are living with profound pain from how he died , and it 's something very bad and terrible , " the aunt said . " i look at the videos now and i can not sleep because it 's too hard . " the police killing of @entity5 has left the family grief - stricken and torn apart . in fact , a rift has developed between his mother 's family and his former wife , @entity157 , 32 , who 's also mother to his two young daughters . each side commissioned a separate autopsy on @entity5 ' body . the mother and the former wife have n't spoken to one another for years . in fact , @entity5 and the former wife had been separated for many years , according to the mother and the former wife 's attorney . in all , the case involves three autopsies , including the one conducted by authorities . in a surprising revelation this past week , one of the autopsies appeared to conflict with the official account . the autopsy commissioned by @entity157 and her attorney appeared to show that @entity5 had bullet wounds to the buttocks and the back of the arm . that is at odds with what authorities said a day earlier , when @entity189 sgt. @entity188 told reporters , " we do know this from the preliminary autopsy report , there were no shots in the back . " @entity195 police belong to a team of local law agencies , called the @entity198 , that is conducting an independent investigation of the police shooting of @entity5 in @entity0 . @entity204 prosecuting attorney @entity203 declined to comment this week on how the conflict between the two autopsies . @entity203 was shown a copy of a body diagram in the second autopsy , conducted by the former wife 's side , he said . " our office is waiting for complete reports from both pathologists before making any conclusions , " @entity203 said in a statement . " there are several questions that will be answered in the final pathology reports including number of gunshot wounds , number of bullets recovered , bullet trajectories , etc. , " @entity203 said . ultimately , an inquest jury will " decide what information is significant to the cause and manner of death and whether anyone is criminally liable for mr. @entity5 's death , " @entity203 said . @entity5 's mother said her son married @entity157 in a church ceremony in @entity4 more than 10 years ago , but the marriage was n't officially registered with civil records . @entity157 could n't be reached for comment , but her attorney , @entity239 , acknowledged his client 's church marriage in @entity4 and asserted that @entity157 is the legal wife and widow of @entity5 . the couple had been separated for " quite some time , " and @entity157 and the couple 's two daughters now live in @entity247 , @entity243 said . meanwhile , @entity157 and her two children this week withdrew a $ 25 million claim against the city of @entity0 alleging that officers killed @entity5 " execution style , " @entity243 said . @entity243 said his client wants to do more research and investigation into the shooting . the former wife plans to file a renewed claim at a later date , @entity243 said . for her part , @entity5 - @entity5 ' mother has hired attorney @entity262 , who has represented the families of @entity264 and @entity265 , both young @entity267 - @entity46 men whose deaths caused national protests . @entity264 , 19 , was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in @entity271 , @entity272 ; the officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing . @entity265 , 17 , was also unarmed when he was fatally shot in a physical confrontation in @entity276 with former neighborhood watch captain @entity277 , who was later acquitted of a murder charge by a jury . meanwhile , the @entity4 consul in @entity281 , @entity282 , has written a letter to @entity0 police chief @entity284 expressing " deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed @entity4 national by police officers . " @entity5 ' mother and family have asked @entity46 attorney general @entity292 to conduct " a full , fair and complete investigation " into the killing , according to a friday letter provided by the mother 's attorney . the @entity300 office in @entity281 is monitoring the case , a spokesman said . also , the @entity303 in @entity281 " is monitoring the investigation of this use of force , conducted by the @entity198 , " @entity303 spokeswoman @entity302 in @entity281 said . meanwhile , @entity29 community leaders in @entity0 met wednesday with the @entity46 attorney for @entity1 , @entity309 , and assistant u.s. attorney a. @entity310 , according to the group @entity29 . the meeting lasted two and a half hours , the group said . that organization is advancing a community demand for a @entity46 @entity300 inquiry into @entity5 ' killing because of " widely - held community beliefs that the local police investigation of the police shooting was perceived as a conflict of interest and was lacking in credibility and impartiality , " @entity29 said . according to the group , the federal prosecutor 's office will provide remedies and suggestions to @entity0 police on their practices and procedures . for now , @entity5 - @entity5 ' mother has taken control over her son 's body , which she plans to send to @entity4 for burial on a little ranch called @entity336 in the @entity70 municipality of @entity338 , she said . the former wife is n't contesting the mother 's control over @entity5 ' body , said @entity243 , attorney for the former wife . the plot is near where the mother and her family live , in the mountains far from people . in fact , they must walk a good distance just to go shopping , @entity5 said . his burial has been delayed because the mother commissioned an autopsy on her son in @entity276 , conducted this past week , and she has ordered more tests on his remains . his grave will mark the end to a long journey . he came to the @entity46 looking for his own @entity46 dream , @entity5 's family said . but he left the world through what his family says is a continuing nightmare . @entity2 en @entity60 's @entity369 reported from @entity0 . @entity2 's @entity370 wrote and reported from @entity371 .	@entity8:Washington state	@entity29:Consejo Latino	@entity203:Sant	@entity338:Aquila	@entity373:Antonio Zambrano-Montes	@entity371:Los Angeles	@entity264:Brown	@entity276:Florida	@entity277:George Zimmerman	@entity272:Missouri	@entity336:Pomaro	@entity189:Kennewick Police	@entity271:Ferguson	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Eastern Washington	@entity0:Pasco	@entity5:Zambrano-Montes	@entity198:Tri-City Special Investigative Unit	@entity157:Ruiz	@entity195:Kennewick	@entity239:Charles Herrmann	@entity46:United States	@entity52:Agapita Montes	@entity50:To√±o	@entity204:Franklin County	@entity126:English	@entity70:Michoacan	@entity292:Eric Holder	@entity188:Ken Lattin	@entity310:Aine Ahmed	@entity247:California	@entity243:Herrmann	@entity265:Martin	@entity369:Jaqueline Hurtado	@entity267:African	@entity262:Benjamin Crump	@entity302:Ayn Dietrich-Williams	@entity303:FBI	@entity300:Department of Justice	@entity140:Erlinda Zambrano	@entity4:Mexico	@entity370:Michael Martinez	@entity309:Michael Ormsby	@entity282:Eduardo Baca	@entity281:Seattle	@entity42:YouTube	@entity284:Robert Metzger	@entity63:Saint Patrick Catholic Church	@entity60:Espanol
upcoming film stars @entity31 , playing @entity13 as the " @placeholder "	@entity0	( @entity1 ) -- " @entity0 ? " give me a break . if you 've been to the movies lately , you may have seen a trailer for a @entity8 film with that name . it 's the title of the first book in a two - volume memoir by former stock swindler @entity13 , upon whom the film is based . the trailer appears to portray @entity13 as a player in a small part of lower @entity17 that 's become the world - famous icon of capitalism . it opens with dizzying shots of famous symbols such as the @entity25 sign and the bronze charging bull statue , a favorite photo backdrop for tourists . there 's a hilarious scene with @entity13 , played by @entity31 , hamming it up with one of his early mentors , played by @entity36 , at a window table in a restaurant with fabulous city views . you think @entity25 big shots might go there . and if you have n't caught on yet , the camera moves to @entity13 on his yacht , which happens to be bobbing in a harbor with the @entity48 in the background . " @entity0 of @entity25 " might turn out to be great entertainment , which is what @entity51 is for . and maybe @entity13 really did dock his 167 - foot yacht near the @entity54 at least once before it sank in a @entity56 storm . but do n't fall for the scenery . as @entity58 , his second wife , said during an argument portrayed in his memoir , " my husband , the @entity0 ! it 's almost too ridiculous for words . " for starters , almost all of @entity13 's lucrative criminal career took place in a less glamorous locale than those opening scenes . after seven months in his first job in the securities industry , pitching stocks over the telephone for a genuine @entity25 - based firm , @entity13 left there after stocks crashed in 1987 and headed east . his intention , he says in the memoir , was to bring " my own version of @entity25 out to @entity81 instead . " the expressway to his schemes to convey what @entity13 's professional life in this " version of @entity25 " was really like , the film trailer should start with shots of @entity90 traffic and segue to a scene in a @entity93 diner near @entity94 , @entity81 , population about 3,000 , near the border with @entity97 . @entity13 's firm , @entity98 , was headquartered there . in his memoir , he says he had breakfast at the diner with another mentor three times a week . employing hundreds of brokers , @entity13 's @entity81 version of @entity25 was a huge , infamous example of a type of thievery known as a " pump and dump " scheme . in the scheme 's first stage , @entity13 and his partner , @entity111 , secretly got control of stock in small companies that @entity117 took public . then @entity117 brokers , working banks of telephones , called individuals throughout the @entity122 , using scripts that included wildly optimistic predictions about how high the stocks ' prices would go . when enough people had finally been fooled into buying the shares , the price really did rise as a result . ignoring instructions from ordinary investors who wanted to sell , @entity13 and other insiders cashed in at the peak , dumped all their stock into the market for a huge profit , and left the people they 'd duped holding nearly worthless stock . trying to impress potential victims , brokers at @entity141 and many other so - called " boiler rooms " said they were calling from " @entity25 . " in fact , their only real connection with @entity25 was that some of the stocks they sold were traded at exchanges there , and the boiler rooms ' " clearing firms " ( companies handling the mechanical details of stock trades ) might be there . the tactic evidently worked . altogether , individual investors , many of them retirees , were cheated out of about $ 250 million by @entity98 by the time regulators managed to close it in 1996 . there was a book in 1929 called " @entity0 of @entity25 , " based on a b - movie by that name about a fellow who cornered the market in copper . that helps me believe someone really did call @entity13 that at least once . but during more than a dozen years following @entity13 's story for @entity172 , i never once heard him referred to as " @entity0 . " not by his friends , enemies or ex-employees , and certainly not by the legions of regulators trying to close him down . @entity178 , director of the @entity179 , headed a long investigation of @entity117 in the 1990s . he told me he had n't heard it either . he thinks @entity13 invented the " @entity183 " nickname himself . " i have to give him credit , " @entity178 says . " he 's not stupid . " not ' @entity183 , ' but something else ... a word i did often hear to refer to boiler - room operators was something farther down the food chain -- " cockroach . " the brokers themselves used it . @entity13 made it into a verb when he testified in the trial of @entity117 's accountant years after @entity117 closed . after it became obvious that regulators were about to shut @entity117 down , he , @entity111 and some advisers decided to " close @entity117 's doors ... and cockroach , " he said . in his memoir , @entity13 explains what he calls the " @entity206 , " saying it meant setting up satellite firms when regulators got close to a big boiler room , moving brokers there in batches and continuing to operate as before at the new location . for regulators , he wrote , closing a crooked brokerage suddenly became " like stepping on a cockroach and squashing it , only to find 10 new ones scurrying in all directions . " it 's a real pity that the " @entity183 " movie trailer does n't give you some idea about who these victims were . decidely middle class , unsophisticated investors , they included @entity230 and @entity231 , 88 - year - old @entity233 residents . they lost $ 252,000 in 1994 after a @entity117 broker replaced their holdings with worthless stocks without authorization . @entity238 , a @entity239 veteran , lost $ 62,000 in a 1996 @entity117 swindle , and had to take out a second mortgage on his house to afford care for his ailing mother . when he saw the fictional movie " @entity246 " a few years later , @entity238 said , " i just about cried . " many of the swindled await their money despite @entity13 's lucrative movie and book deals , and earnings from a new career as a motivational speaker , many of these victims are still waiting for restitution . when @entity13 was sentenced in 2003 to four years in prison , judge @entity257 ordered him to pay about $ 110.4 million to a victims fund , in installments equal to 50 % of his monthly gross income , after his release from jail . if any major changes in his financial circumstances took place , the percentage @entity13 had to pay could be adjusted up or down . after i asked for an update on the fund in early october , lawyers in the office of @entity270 , @entity122 attorney for the @entity271 , replied that @entity13 had only contributed about $ 11.6 million to the victims ' fund so far -- about one - tenth of the required total . in a court filing with many details about @entity13 's current income whited out , @entity270 's office asked @entity257 to find @entity13 in default , saying that according to his tax returns and other available information , the payments he has been making are " insufficient . " they said that in 2011 , for instance , @entity13 paid $ 21,000 in restitution , although he made more than $ 1 million for the motion picture rights to his memoir , as well as more income from a motivational speaking corporation he half - owns . @entity13 's attorneys responded that he does n't deny he still owes money to victims , but that his position is his obligation to pay 50 % of his income to them ended when his term of " supervised release " from prison expired in april 2009 . they said that for the past two years , he 's been trying to arrange a " forbearance " agreement with the government to " pay 100 % of the profits of the movie and the two books , " but that his offer has been turned down . " before you accuse me of anything , you should learn the facts , " @entity13 said in an e-mail last week . " i have been trying to settle this case forever and have been completely stonewalled . i can even show you the settlement offer from the government , on their letterhead , asking for only 50 % of my books , after i offered 100 % . " on friday afternoon , the government asked to withdraw its pending motion to hold @entity13 in default on his payments to victims . oral argument in the case had been scheduled to begin nov. 22 . in a court document , @entity326 , assistant u.s. attorney for the @entity271 , said the delay would give both sides " an opportunity to explore a resolution " of certain issues , and that " mr. @entity13 joins in this request . " the movie , originally scheduled for mid-november , is now set for release on christmas day . meanwhile , the website for " @entity13 's @entity337 , " his motivational speaking company , features a video of @entity31 doing a bit of speaking himself . " there is nothing quite like @entity13 's public speaking and his ability to train and empower young entrepreneurs , " @entity31 says . " @entity348 stands as a shining example of the transformative qualities of ambition and hard work , and in that regard , he is a true motivator .

community garden project a symbol of hope for @placeholder shantytown	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- living amid the garbage - strewn sewage canals , residents of @entity3 's @entity2 endure a grim battle for survival every single day . the shantytown in the northern reaches of capital @entity9 is one of the countries poorest areas , blighted by poor sanitation and violence . shacks , on average , house nine people and around half the population earn less than $ 0.50 a day . it 's little wonder then that life expectancy is n't much more than 50 years , according to the healthcare @entity22 , @entity24 . but one man is hoping to challenge this statistic , planting the seeds of a healthier future for the district 's 250,000 population by transforming a garbage dump into a vibrant urban garden . " growing up in @entity2 we have the situation where people think it 's somewhere nothing good can happen , " says local resident @entity33 . " but myself and some members of the community wanted to have something to turn it green and nothing could be better than a garden . " the results are extraordinary . @entity45 ( @entity46 ) covers half - an - acre and is the largest urban garden in the country . teeming with plants and people planting and picking them , the garden is hugely popular with locals . " we grow about 20 different vegetables in the garden , " explains @entity33 . founded in 2011 , the garden has an abundance of vegetables and herbs : eggplants , peppers , chard , radishes , potatoes , parsley , basil . it 's a cornucopia of healthy green vegetables that rivals any community farm in the world . " people get in mind that it 's not possible to garden in @entity3 -- the soil is no longer good , we do n't have water . but you see we have accomplished something really amazing , " says @entity33 . the bulk of the produce is used for the local soup kitchen providing much needed nutrition for the community . whatever is left is sold at market . it 's not just the plants which catch your eye , but also the recycled pots and containers . old tires , shoes , footballs are filled and planted . even toilet bowls and old suitcases have been put to use . " we use whatever we can find . the whole point is first we want the kids to feel connected with what seems like nothing much , because this is something that would just float in the canal . we say : ' no ! it could grow parsley , ' " @entity33 says . " i want them to be able to eat , to make money out of the garden and to feel more peace through the garden . if i can see these three things happen , i would feel as if i had fulfilled my dream .

@entity53 , an @placeholder - linked militant group in @entity55 , claims responsibility	@entity56	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- armed gunmen faced off with @entity1 police and soldiers inside an upscale @entity0 shopping mall early sunday , hours after brazenly gunning down shoppers , diners and more . around 2:30 a.m. sunday ( 6:30 p.m. et saturday ) -- an hour after reporting five " visibly shaken " hostages had been released -- @entity1 's @entity10 cryptically tweeted " major operations underway . " what that meant was a mystery , and it did n't quell fears about what has happened or might happen to an unknown number of civilians who were still unaccounted for inside . the same agency offered an update about three hours later stating that hostages were being held " in several locations , " adding there was " no communications as yet . " by then , government authorities had secured the mall 's upper levels , though it was not known where the attackers -- and the threat -- remained . hours earlier , @entity1 's president announced that 39 people , including some of his close relatives , were confirmed dead in the attack . two gunmen , including one who was detained after being shot , are also dead . @entity39 , secretary to the @entity40 , tweeted another 293 people got treatment at three area hospitals , which " are appealing for more blood . " the wounded range in age from 2 to 78 , the disaster operations center said , urging people to " remember them in your prayers . " q and a : @entity53 grew amid @entity55 's lawlessness @entity53 , an @entity56 - linked militant group based in @entity55 with ties to @entity0 's @entity59 district and whose most recent attack of this scale came july 2010 in @entity64 's capital , claimed responsibility for the carnage and vowed not to negotiate with @entity1 authorities . it claimed that " all @entity75 " were escorted from the mall before the attack , suggesting its targets were people who did n't believe in their extreme form of @entity74 . " the @entity78 are still strong inside # @entity79 and still holding their ground , " the group said late saturday via @entity77 . " all praise is due to @entity82 ! " @entity1 authorities , though , insist they have the upper hand , where it 's now early sunday morning . the last few hours of saturday and the first few of sunday , in @entity1 , were largely quiet outside the mall except for movement police tweeted that the attackers " have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces . " and @entity92 , the national government 's cabinet secretary for interior and coordination , hinted that the worst should be over . " our security forces have taken control of the situation , " @entity92 said . " @entity102 shopping mall have been isolated and pinned down in a room by security forces in the ongoing operation , " the national police said on @entity77 . @entity1 's president , @entity106 , blasted " the despicable perpetrators of this cowardly act ( who ) hoped to intimidate , divide and cause despondency among @entity1 and would like to ( create ) a closed , fearful and fractured society . " @entity2 security analyst : @entity1 , @entity113 high on @entity53 's list @entity1 is no stranger to terrorism , including a 1998 bombing at the @entity118 in @entity0 that left 213 dead and other attacks before and since tied to @entity56 and related groups . in a televised speech late saturday , @entity106 said his nation has " overcome " such attacks before , refusing to budge from its values or relinquish his security . and it will do so again , he promised . " we shall hunt down the perpetrators wherever they run to , " the president said . " we shall get them , and we shall punish them for this heinous crime . midday peace shattered by gunfire , blasts " @entity79 lends itself a serene and safe environment away from the city centre , " the mall 's official website states . that may have been true before -- while there had been warnings , the high - end mall filled with more than 80 stores and restaurants had never been targeted . but it could n't have been further from the truth saturday . rattles of gunshots that started around noon shattered any sense of normalcy among those picking up groceries , savoring lunch and browsing through the racks at stores . @entity158 was sipping coffee when he heard what first sounded like a fallen table , then the continuing rat - a - tat of gunfire . as the gunshots became louder , people began screaming and running for the exits . gripped by fear : not seeing attackers was part of the terror some went outside , only to turn around and go back into the four - story mall after realizing bullets were flying there as well . @entity158 was among them , joining about 20 people who took shelter for about five hours in a women 's bathroom cubicle . " they had grenades , and it was really , really loud , " he told @entity2 , adding that he noticed tear gas in the corridors as well . " all of us felt like they were close . " as people texted family and friends outside the mall , word spread that nobody could be trusted -- and , even if the good guys could be sorted from the bad guys , the barrage of intermittent gunfire made any escape seem futile . @entity196 , a @entity197 resident , experienced similar horror in the mall 's parking garage . as her car pulled up , she and others heard gunfire -- prompting them to crawl underneath and sneak behind cars before getting into a stairwell . she had company there , including two people bleeding from gunshot wounds . eventually , the stairwell lights went back on and the door to a nearby supermarket opened , so they dashed through and past a nearby loading dock to safety . " there was blood throughout the supermarket , " @entity196 recalled . " ... it was n't clear if it was ok to exit . i was short of sheep following . " soldiers crawl under cars , copters fly overhead by then , the sight of @entity1 soldiers in military fatigues crawling under cars with their guns cocked made clear that the once shiny , pristine @entity79 had become a war zone . the whirr of surveillance helicopters overhead drove home the point . police took those leaving the building in a straight line , arms raised in the air . they were all taken to a secluded place for vetting to ensure they were not attackers . the military asked media not to televise anything live because the gunmen might be watching screens inside the mall and therefore take cues on their movement . and everyone else , except for authorities , was urged to stay away as roads and nearby locales , including another shopping center , was closed down . world leaders condemn terror attack at @entity1 mall , pledge support the @entity260 condemned the attack " in the strongest possible terms , " voicing solidarity with @entity1 while calling terrorism " one of the most serious threats to international peace and security . " most of the casualties are @entity1 , authorities said . but the mall is popular with expatriates and foreign nationals , who are among those killed and injured . that includes two dead @entity280 nationals , their government said . likewise , two @entity281 -- one of them a diplomat -- died in the attack , according to prime minister @entity286 's office . @entity288 secretary of state @entity287 said there were several @entity288 among the injured but none among the dead , though the wife of a foreign national working for the @entity292 was killed .

@placeholder went on medical leave in october so doctors could remove a blood clot from her brain 's surface	@entity22	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 president @entity2 is no wallflower when it comes to public speaking . she 's known for passionate proclamations on national television and rapid - fire online posts about her work . but it 's been almost a month since her last public appearance and 33 days since her last @entity15 post , prompting critics to question who 's in charge of the @entity20 country . close aides to @entity22 have dismissed such concerns , stressing that she 's the one making the government calls . " the president is present every day , working with us , " cabinet secretary @entity26 told reporters earlier this month , according to the state - run @entity29 news agency . @entity22 went on medical leave in october so doctors could perform emergency surgery to remove a blood clot on the surface of her brain . she officially returned to work in november and appeared at a series of events in december . but now , with @entity22 largely out of public view once again , speculation has surged about her whereabouts , and her health . " if we had n't had the president 's illness just a few months ago , one would discard it . but the problem is the rumor has been established , and the sense of uncertainty of not knowing why , " said @entity55 , director of the @entity56 at the @entity57 in @entity0 . " is it a political strategy ? is she making room for a new candidate for 2015 ? is it because she does not want to face difficult situations for the government ? we do not know . " others think @entity22 is taking a break to take care of her health and not face a similar fate as her husband , former president @entity73 , who died in 2010 after suffering a heart attack . " i think she does not want to repeat that story , " said @entity75 , another political analyst . as @entity3 has faced high inflation and other challenges in recent weeks , @entity26 was the public face of the government . on the streets of @entity0 , residents say they have felt the president 's absence . " there are many problems that require a solution , and there is no clear response from her , " worker @entity86 said . merchant @entity93 said she was worried about the situation .

@placeholder , 26 , was arrested friday	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 , @entity3 , man is due in court thursday to face charges that he raped a 13 - year - old runaway police say he held prisoner in his home for six months . @entity9 , 26 , has pleaded not guilty to second - degree rape , unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference . thursday 's hearing will determine if the case should be referred to a grand jury . @entity2 police said that @entity9 kept the girl in his home from july through december 2009 , behind dead - bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs . a criminal complaint alleges that @entity9 had sex with her more than 100 times . @entity26 spokesman @entity25 said @entity9 also forced the girl to baby - sit his year - old son . @entity9 is unmarried , and the identity of the child 's mother is not known . police would not say how the girl left @entity35 's home , why there was a delay from december to february for his arrest or where the teenager is now . @entity9 was arrested friday when police raided his home on a child - abuse allegation , @entity2 media reported . the next day , @entity44 judge @entity43 set bond at $ 250,000 in an arraignment at which @entity9 represented himself . he has since been provided with a court - appointed attorney , according to media reports . but friends of the defendant told the @entity52 that he was nothing more than a @entity54 trying to help a runaway girl he met in a @entity2 park . " everybody has had their moments , but @entity60 is not a monster . as long as i 've known @entity60 , he 's always been kindhearted to me . if he could help you , he will help you , " @entity63 , 20 , who grew up next door to @entity9 's relatives , told the paper . " @entity60 always had her calling to someone , supposedly her aunt , to say she was doing ok . from what i knew , her aunt or her mom knew where she was staying , " said @entity63 , who previously had a romantic relationship with @entity9 . " to look at her , she is very developed physically , and you would think that she is older than 13 . " @entity63 said the girl told her she was 17 or 18 and denied having sex with @entity9 , and that she also said she did not want to go home to her mother , the @entity52 said . police told the news that the family filed several missing person reports after the girl disappeared in july . and an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that @entity9 was a manipulative drug dealer who " lured her in " and kept her trapped physically and psychologically . @entity0 , however , could not confirm that official 's view . @entity92 , who lives four doors from @entity9 , said he was surprised when he learned about the accusations . " this is a street where everyone knows everyone , " said @entity92 , who remembered @entity9 moving in about a year - and - a - half ago . " i never recall him with a 13 - year - old girl . " @entity92 said @entity9 was seldom home , and their brief conversations were limited to @entity9 's two dogs . other neighbors told @entity92 the house had a steady stream of visitors on any given day .	@entity3:New York	@entity2:Buffalo	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:Police	@entity25:Michael DeGeorge	@entity9:Abdallah	@entity43:James A.W.

@entity311 , @entity312 , changed the name of a street from @placeholder to @entity138	@entity336	( @entity0 ) -- even if you 're a real nowhere man living under the sea in an octopus 's garden , you probably already know that 50 years ago ( february 9 , 1964 , to be exact ) the @entity5 kicked off @entity6 in the @entity7 with their first appearance on " the @entity9 . " the @entity5 's subsequent globetrotting blazed a trail that , half a century later , remains worth following . particularly if you can avoid an overload of gratuitous @entity5 song titles along the way . here are some of the world 's best places to relive the original magical mystery tour . 1 . @entity19 , @entity20 the city where it all started has traded heavily on the @entity5 as part of efforts to transform itself from a declining industrial seaport into a tourism and cultural destination . mercifully it works . obvious attractions include the well - executed @entity31 ( @entity32 , @entity33 , +44 151 709 1963 ) ; the reconstructed @entity34 ( 10 mathew st. , +44 151 236 9091 ) ; and tours that hit childhood homes and lyricized locations such as @entity38 . these are balanced by @entity41 attractions . the city has impressive @entity44 and @entity45 cathedrals , the iconic ferry across the @entity47 , the @entity49 and @entity50 art galleries and the wonderful ( and free ) waterfront @entity52 . the latter of these pays homage to the city 's maritime heritage and a musical legacy that goes far beyond @entity5 . 2 . @entity58 , @entity59 lured by the prospect of regular paychecks , the embryonic @entity5 packed their guitar cases for @entity58 in 1960 . here they refined their act and lineup during several seasons of relentless gigging in front of indifferent crowds in grimy nightclubs . fans can take tours or simply explore @entity72 , a seedy - in - places district of brothels and nightspots where the band played several venues during their time here . the @entity79 ( 36 @entity80 , +49 40 317 778 ) is among the most famous . @entity58 is a vibrant source of new , mainly electronic , music and nightlife . like @entity19 , it has a distinctive church , the @entity86 ( @entity87 1 , +49 40 376 780 ) and a museum exploring the city 's maritime past ( @entity92 sen. @entity91 1 , +49 40 30 092 300 ) . 3 . @entity93 , @entity94 by 1966 the @entity5 were experimenting -- musically and pharmaceutically . their altered outlook took them to @entity93 , in northeast @entity94 's @entity97 foothills , to attend the ashram of @entity99 , an @entity94 guru who developed and taught transcendental meditation . these days the ashram , which once overlooked the @entity102 , is closed and is slowly being reclaimed by vegetation . but @entity93 , an important @entity105 center , remains open for business -- billing itself as @entity94 's leading destination for yoga and adventure sports , although probably not at the same time . proximity to @entity112 makes it a good escape from the @entity94 capital for some whitewater rafting or a stay at one of its many yoga ashrams ( among them @entity120 , +91 135 243 4301 ) . not a precisely @entity5 experience , but in the world of transcendental meditation , close is sometimes all you get . 4 . @entity125 the @entity5 lived and worked at various venues in the @entity20 capital ( yes , there are tours ) , but few locations have as much of a connection with the band as @entity133 ( 3 @entity134 , near @entity136 tube station ) . the @entity5 recorded several albums here , including 1969 's " @entity134 , " which features a hirsute @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 striding over the nearby pedestrian crossing . there 's no public access to the studios , which still host top music acts . but that has n't stopped thousands of visitors scrawling their names on the building 's boundary wall or halting traffic to recreate the famous crossing image . as a bonus , @entity139 still lives nearby , and sightings are n't unknown . 5 . @entity156 newlyweds @entity138 and @entity158 began their 1969 honeymoon with a highly publicized " bed - in " at the @entity161 ( @entity162 138 , +31 710 6000 ) , where they invited the press into their room to promote " bed peace " and " hair peace . " the room is now known as the " @entity170 and @entity158 suite " and can be reserved by guests . the couple wound up in the @entity174 capital after their own mini-tour of @entity177 . they 'd tried to marry on a ferry across the @entity180 ( @entity181 run a regular service , but still no weddings ) before succeeding in @entity184 -- a fact the @entity187 territory continues to celebrate thanks to the number of international weddings it now hosts . 6 . @entity192 , @entity193 after @entity156 , @entity170 and @entity158 zipped down to @entity194 for another peace - based press conference , this time in the city 's luxury @entity197 ( @entity200 4 , +43 1 514 560 ) -- until then famous only for giving the world a preposterously rich chocolate cake . this was n't @entity193 's first brush with the @entity5 . in 1965 , the band decamped to the charming central @entity193 ski resort of @entity207 to film snow scenes for their movie " help ! " the band stayed at the @entity210 , the modern incarnation ( @entity212 merstrasse 75 , +43 6456 7245 ) of which avoids any mention of the @entity5 on its website , although it does depict them in what appears to be the men 's toilets . 7 . @entity218 @entity138 had wanted to take his bed - in to @entity218 , but was prevented from setting foot in the @entity7 at the time due to a previous conviction for cannabis possession . he and the @entity5 , however , paid several other significant visits to the city . first there was the historic february 9 , 1964 , television appearance at the now - named @entity227 ( 1697 @entity228 , +1 212 975 4755 ) . more history was made several days later when @entity5 became the first rock band ever to play @entity231 ( 881 7th ave. , +1 212 247 7800 ) . the band returned to play @entity218 the following august , but that trip was eclipsed a year later when they performed at @entity234 in @entity235 . this is believed to be rock and pop music 's first - ever stadium gig . @entity234 was torn down in 2008 to provide parking space for the @entity242 ' new @entity241 ( 123 - 01 @entity243 , +1 718 507 6387 ) , but there are plenty other @entity246 attractions nearby , particularly the space age relics of two @entity248 ( @entity249 , +1 718 760 6565 ) . @entity138 , of course , later lived and was killed in @entity218 outside his residence at the @entity252 ( corner of @entity254 and @entity255 in @entity256 ) . along with the @entity252 , the adjacent @entity257 ( near @entity255 between 71st and 74th @entity258 ) is a 2.5 - acre area of @entity255 that pays homage to @entity138 . 8 . the @entity261 another double - hit destination for @entity138 , who flew here with @entity158 on the next stage of his bed tour , but swiftly left after checking into the @entity266 in @entity267 ( now unlisted ) , reportedly declaring : " we ca n't do a bloody bed - in here . let 's go to @entity271 . " more successful was @entity138 's 1965 visit to the islands with the other @entity5 , again to film scenes for " help ! " the band stayed at the @entity277 , a hotel on @entity280 's @entity279 now renamed the @entity281 ( @entity282 , @entity280 , +1 242 327 6400 ) . they filmed scenes on @entity285 , now home to the @entity288 resort ( +1 888 - 877 7525 ) , and @entity289 , an uninhabited private island popular for day trips and wedding parties . 9 . @entity292 and so , at last , to @entity170 and @entity158 's final bed - in venue : the queen elizabeth hotel in @entity292 ( 900 @entity295 , +1 866 540 4483 ) . here the couple commandeered four rooms and invited friends including lsd fan @entity299 and beat poet @entity300 to join them recording " @entity301 . " according to the hotel 's website , @entity138 has since been followed to the @entity304 by other sometime peaceniks , including @entity306 , @entity7 president @entity307 , @entity309 leader @entity308 and the @entity310 . 10 . @entity311 , @entity312 ok , the @entity5 never actually visited this tank - producing @entity312 city east of the @entity315 , but that did n't stop the citizens of @entity311 taking the @entity5 to their hearts . even though few in the @entity309 were able to buy or listen to @entity5 songs at the height of the @entity323 , many drew inspiration from a band that was later credited with hastening the demise of communist rule -- even if their classic " @entity331 " was more about girls than politics . post-soviet @entity311 has repaid the favor by changing the name of a street from @entity336 to @entity138 . lately , however , @entity311 is obsessed with a new star -- or falling star , in the shape of the huge meteorite which smashed into the region last year . reports say the city hopes thousands of tourists will be attracted by this asteroid from -- sorry , it ca n't be helped -- " @entity347 .

" we believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of ... president @entity5 but are a clear and calculated attack on the @entity8 , " the party said on its website . " we therefore again call on all @entity1 , members and ( supporters ) of the @entity8 and our alliance partners to come and register their outrage at this insult and attack on our president and the @entity8 , " it said . the sunday newspaper @entity51 removed the image of the portrait from its website after the @entity8 threatened a boycott , but it complained monday the @entity8 still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place . @entity57 , the @entity8 's official opposition , said @entity22 " was brilliant as a work of political satire , which is also why it became an instant icon . " calls for the painting 's censorship , the party said , indicate a dangerous move away from the right to free speech . if he felt insulted , @entity5 should have sued the artist rather than calling for the painting 's removal , the @entity57 said .	@entity22:The Spear	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:South Africans	@entity0:Johannesburg	@entity24:Soviet	@entity5:Jacob Zuma	@entity16:Goodman Gallery	@entity8:ANC	@entity19:SABC	@entity51:City Press	@entity21:Brett Murray	@entity57:Democratic Alliance	@entity27:Red
@placeholder accused of being satanists in 1980s	@entity136	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- violence and heavy metal seem to have been inextricably entwined since the dawn of the metal genre . accusations that the @entity9 killers were influenced by @entity11 's music were found to be false . @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity13 are just some of the household metal names to have come under public fire for supposedly inciting teenagers to commit murder and suicide . it 's a fire the international media has been happy to flame , quick to draw links between various acts of savagery and heavy metal even if , as in the case of the columbine shootings and @entity11 , evidence points to the contrary . for anthropologist , documentary filmmaker and self - confessed " metalhead " @entity32 , heavy metal is often used as a scapegoat to distract from the thoroughly more complicated societal problems surrounding such incidents . " i think people look at heavy metal and label it for all sorts of things because we need easy answers to complex questions , " @entity32 says . " i think that it 's easy to target a heavy metal band for inciting violence or making kids turn to a cult than it is to actually look at real problems in the real world . " it 's easy to see where the journalists , parents and religious groups get their ideas from . a quick scan of the lyrics of any heavy metal band worth its salt will often reveal some gasp - inducing subject matter . for instance in his film " @entity68 , " @entity32 quotes some of his favourite lyrics by a metal band called @entity71 : " @entity72 , bloody foam spews from your mouth , smell the putrid stench of flesh , as it burns you to your death . " not the sort of poetry to be quoting to grandmother over lunch , but can such ludicrous gore really incite people to violence , not to mention murder ? as one young @entity88 metal fan told the @entity91 's @entity90 newspaper : " it 's all fantasy , none of this is real , you ca n't take this seriously , it 's just like a movie . " but compared to some of the images filling our cinema screens -- the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 to name a few -- even @entity104 's lyrics seem a little tame . " i have listened to enough metal for me to essentially be a serial killer , " says @entity105 from @entity91 music magazine @entity106 . " but there 's something in me that says no , that 's not what i believe life is about . serial killers existed before @entity114 , you know . " " i 'm a big fan of horror movies but @entity117 , @entity118 , those torture porn films , i found myself repulsed -- metal is pantomime comparatively . " as @entity122 quips : " there 's more blood in ' @entity125 ' than in my shows and that 's required school reading . " for metal musicians , death , blood and mayhem , in its various guises , are all simply part of the act , part of " the show . " " i think it comes from being a child of the ' 70s , " says @entity136 's lead singer @entity135 . " i was brought up on hammer horror movies and things like " @entity141 , " classics like that . " " so while we do the devil type things , it 's done ... i would n't always say in a tongue - in - cheek way , but there is an element of it . it 's done with a view to storytelling and drama , with a bit of dressing - up going on . " @entity136 has also endured its fair share of controversy . the title of its 1982 album , " @entity162 , " and repeated use of " 666 " in the titular track 's chorus had @entity167 's religious right up in arms . they accused the band of being devil worshippers , satanists and of " trying to pervert our kids . " " when i play that song i think , well , ok , this is n't glorifying the devil , because that 's certainly not what i would do , " says @entity136 drummer @entity174 , a born - again @entity175 . " it 's making an awareness that yes he 's out there , and you 've got to be aware . there is a man with 666 tattooed on his noggin somewhere . " ironically , the fundamentalist reaction to " @entity162 " packed out @entity136 tour gigs in every @entity167 town they visited . kids squeezed into arenas desperate to see what was scaring their parents so badly . despite this marketing draw , @entity135 is keen to distance @entity136 from the violence for violence 's sake approach practiced by some of his contemporaries , such as musicians from the extreme @entity204 and @entity205 sub-genres . " we 're not interested in being extreme , " he says . " we 're interested in being interesting and in animating people 's imaginations with the stories that we tell and the songs . " it 's an approach that chimes with what one female @entity136 fan , @entity217 , tells us , " i really do n't see any violence in the fans and i have been to loads of their gigs , " she says . " i am in a tiny minority of women , in a room full of men wearing black -- which should seem scary , but it totally is n't . the men hold doors open for me and apologize if they bash into me . they are basically really meek and polite . " so while upside - down crucifixes , homicidal zombies and lashings of blood might continue to fuel our preconceptions about heavy metal music , it 's worth remembering , appearances and reality can be very different beasts indeed .	@entity99:Devil 's Rejects	@entity117:Hostel	@entity135:Dickinson	@entity114:Slayer	@entity88:Norwegian	@entity136:Iron Maiden	@entity118:Saw	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:LONDON	@entity0:England	@entity175:Christian	@entity174:Nicko McBrain	@entity9:Columbine	@entity91:UK	@entity90:Guardian	@entity71:Autopsy	@entity72:Burning from the inside out	@entity32:Dunn	@entity13:Black Sabbath	@entity12:Judas Priest	@entity11:Marilyn Manson	@entity100:Wolf Creek	@entity101:The Passion of the Christ	@entity217:Ruth	@entity104:Autopsy	@entity105:James McMahon	@entity106:NME	@entity125:Macbeth	@entity122:Alice Cooper	@entity205:Death Metal	@entity204:Black Metal	@entity162:The Number of the Beast	@entity141:The Devil Rides Out	@entity68:A Headbanger 's Journey	@entity167:American
two @placeholder factories are damaged from @entity19 protests , the company says	@entity13	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the widening fallout from an increasingly volatile territorial dispute between @entity4 and @entity5 prompted a @entity5 company to halt work at plants in @entity4 on monday , and the @entity9 to urge the two sides to avoid letting the situation spiral out of control . the electronics company @entity13 said monday that it was suspending operations at three plants in @entity4 after two of them were damaged amid violent @entity19 protests set off by the clash between @entity21 and @entity0 over a group of small islands in the @entity24 . @entity5 calls the islands @entity26 ; @entity4 calls them @entity26 . background : how remote rock split @entity4 , @entity5 the @entity9 , a key military ally of @entity5 , has called on the two sides to find a peaceful resolution to the disagreement , which is generating more and more unease in the region and starting to hurt economic links between the world 's second and third largest economies . " it 's in everybody 's interest for @entity5 and @entity4 to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation , " @entity9 defense secretary @entity37 said monday at a joint new conference in @entity0 with his @entity5 counterpart , @entity39 . despite describing the @entity9 - @entity5 alliance as the " bedrock of peace and stability " in the @entity33 , @entity37 reiterated that @entity50 does n't take a position on competing sovereignty claims . he did , however , express concern about the demonstrations in @entity4 . parts of @entity13 's facilities in @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 , @entity61 , were damaged by @entity19 protestors on saturday , the company said . it is halting work at the factories until tuesday , it said , as well as at a plant in @entity67 , @entity68 , where some employees have staged a strike over the island issue . unrest took place in dozens of other cities in @entity4 over the weekend . thousands of protesters hurled bottles and eggs outside the @entity5 @entity78 in @entity21 on saturday , expressing anger over @entity0 's announcement last week that it had acquired several of the disputed islands from a @entity5 family to bring them under public ownership . @entity4 declared the purchase to be " illegal " and sent six surveillance vessels to carry out patrols on friday around the remote islands in an effort to underscore its claim to sovereignty . the ships briefly entered @entity5 territorial waters despite warnings not to do so , the @entity92 said . the islands , situated in the @entity24 between @entity97 and @entity98 , are under @entity5 control , but @entity4 claims they have been a part of its territory " since ancient times . " @entity33 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? the events last week ratcheted up the tensions between the two @entity109 nations , where lingering resentment from past conflicts remains close to the surface . that was in evidence in @entity21 at the weekend . waving @entity4 national flags and holding portraits of the late leader @entity117 , the mostly young protesters chanted " down with @entity5 imperialism " and called for war as they made their way down the streets under the watchful eyes of police and guards . messages and photos posted on @entity4 social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking @entity5 stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of @entity5 make . in the southern industrial city of @entity136 , near @entity137 , a protest sunday in front of a local @entity141 office over the island dispute descended into violence when the security forces moved in , said resident @entity145 . the demonstrators began smashing large plant pots and other objects in the street so they could throw the shards at the police , @entity145 said . the @entity19 tone of the protest was clear from the slogans and images on display , he added . @entity5 news media organizations have also reported incidents of assaults on @entity5 citizens in @entity4 in the past few days . a @entity4 foreign ministry spokesman insisted friday that the public anger was not aimed at the @entity5 people , whose safety would be protected in @entity4 according to law . the authorities rarely permit protests in @entity4 , prompting suspicion that the nationwide rallies over the weekend were government - sanctioned . in @entity21 , police walking alongside the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street . by saturday night , @entity4 's state - run media had started appealing for restraint , running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism . in a sign of rising concern over the gathering of large crowds , the authorities in cities that had seen the most ferocious protests canceled entertainment and sporting events . " violence can not be tolerated simply because the protests are aimed at @entity5 , " said an editorial published monday by the @entity190 , a newspaper affiliated with the ruling @entity141 . on monday morning , the streets leading to the @entity5 @entity78 in @entity21 appeared to blocked off by the authorities . after his meetings in @entity5 , @entity37 is due to travel to @entity4 , where he will meet with " top military and civilian leaders including defense minister gen. @entity198 , " according to the @entity199 . animosity between @entity4 and @entity5 over the disputed islands runs deep . they have come to represent what many @entity4 see as unfinished business : redressing the impact of the @entity5 occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity4 during the 1930s and 1940s . @entity4 says its claim goes back hundreds of years . @entity5 says it saw no trace of @entity4 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity5 sovereign territory in 1895 . @entity5 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers . the @entity5 surrender at the end of @entity220 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further . the islands were administered by the @entity9 occupation force after the war . but in 1972 , @entity50 returned them to @entity5 as part of its withdrawal from @entity97 . a public initiative begun in april this year by the outspoken governor of @entity0 , @entity229 , to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations ' claims . @entity229 's move put pressure on the government of prime minister @entity243 to step in with its own bid , which resulted in the controversial deal last week with the @entity247 family , the private owners up until that point . @entity5 's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real - estate transaction , with the islands passing from one @entity5 owner to another , has failed to placate the @entity4 authorities . @entity1 's @entity257 reported from @entity0 and @entity258 from @entity137 . @entity260 @entity259 in @entity21 contributed to this report .	@entity21:Beijing	@entity26:Diaoyu	@entity24:East China Sea	@entity117:Mao Zedong	@entity257:Junko Ogura	@entity258:Jethro Mullen	@entity259:Stan Grant	@entity137:Hong Kong	@entity136:Shenzhen	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Tokyo	@entity199:Pentagon	@entity4:China	@entity9:U.S.	@entity190:Global Times	@entity50:Washington	@entity78:Embassy	@entity92:Japanese Coast Guard	@entity59:Shandong Province	@entity58:Qingdao	@entity33:Asia	@entity13:Panasonic	@entity37:Panetta	@entity145:Rossi	@entity39:Satoshi Morimoto	@entity19:anti-Japanese	@entity247:Kurihara	@entity243:Yoshihiko Noda	@entity98:Taiwan	@entity97:Okinawa	@entity109:East Asian	@entity260:CNNs	@entity141:Communist Party	@entity220:World War II	@entity5:Japanese	@entity229:Ishihara	@entity198:Liang Guanglie	@entity68:Guangdong Province	@entity67:Zhuhai	@entity60:Suzhou	@entity61:Jiangsu Province

@entity161 : @entity2 troops falling victim to shooting by @placeholder forces	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- nearly one out of every five @entity2 soldiers killed in @entity3 this year were killed by @entity3 police or army forces . nine of the 16 victims were @entity9 soldiers . this pattern of attacks raises a fundamental problem for the plans of the @entity9 and other @entity2 countries to draw down their forces over the next two years . that plan is , in part , predicated on the idea that as @entity3 forces take the lead in security operations , they will be supported by small numbers of @entity9 / @entity2 advisers embedded in @entity3 army and police units . those advisers will be quite vulnerable to attack . this problem was underlined earlier this week when an @entity31 ( @entity30 ) officer on monday shot and killed a @entity9 soldier in the eastern province of @entity34 , and the same day an @entity3 soldier murdered two @entity37 soldiers at a @entity2 base in @entity39 , the capital city of @entity40 . monday 's shootings were the latest in a wave of attacks on international troops by @entity3 security forces , prompting concerns over the stepped up frequency of what @entity2 terms " green - on - blue " incidents . incidents of green - on - blue violence were rare in the first few years of the @entity53 , averaging no more than one a year through 2008 . with the " surge " of 33,000 @entity9 troops in 2009 , though , the number of attacks jumped to 4 , likely due to the increased exposure of @entity3 forces to international troops . instead of tapering off , this upward trend continued to a peak of 12 incidents in 2011 . and there have already been nine such attacks this year . in january , an @entity3 soldier fired on a group of @entity68 troops during a training exercise , killing four and wounding 16 . the deadly attack prompted @entity68 president @entity71 to temporarily suspend @entity68 training programs in @entity3 and threaten the early withdrawal of @entity68 troops . @entity2 officials usually characterize these incidents as " isolated , " and not indicative of the overall relationship between coalition forces and their @entity3 partners . but the trust that might have once existed between international forces and their @entity3 counterparts has been seriously undermined by three recent incidents . -- in january a video surfaced on @entity84 showing @entity9 @entity85 urinating on the bodies of suspected @entity88 insurgents . -- this month @entity9 staff sgt. @entity89 was accused of going on a murderous rampage a mile from his base in @entity92 , killing 16 @entity3 civilians . -- the accidental burning of @entity95 by @entity9 soldiers at @entity97 on february 21 sparked massive protests across @entity3 . during one such protest outside a military base in @entity101 , a man wearing an @entity3 army uniform turned his gun on @entity2 troops , killing two @entity9 servicemen . two days later , @entity3 wearing police uniforms shot and killed two @entity9 officers in one of the most secure areas of the @entity111 . the @entity88 quickly claimed responsibility for the murders inside the @entity111 , saying they were in retaliation for the @entity116 burnings . however , the insurgent group 's involvement in planning most of the green - on - blue attacks is doubtful . a few perpetrators have found safe - haven with the @entity88 following their attacks , such as the @entity3 army soldier , @entity123 , who appeared in a @entity88 video in february boasting about his attack on @entity127 troops , but rarely have the @entity88 declared that the @entity3 soldiers and police who have turned their guns on @entity9 and @entity2 troops were working for them . with @entity9 forces making up almost 70 % of the @entity2 troops on the ground in @entity3 , it is not surprising that almost half of the attacks involved the death or injury of @entity9 troops , but as the bar chart on the left shows , many other @entity2 countries have also been the target of insider attacks by @entity3 security forces . sixteen @entity37 soldiers , for instance , have been killed in such attacks . @entity2 's withdrawal strategy requires a high degree of trust between small numbers of military advisors embedded with much larger units of @entity3 troops in order to succeed . this trust has now been eroded to a dangerous degree . does @entity2 have a @entity159 ?	@entity116:Quran	@entity159:Plan B	@entity84:YouTube	@entity85:Marines	@entity111:Interior Ministry	@entity88:Taliban	@entity89:Robert Bales	@entity3:Afghans	@entity2:NATO	@entity0:CNN	@entity174:Bergen	@entity9:U.S.	@entity92:Kandahar	@entity53:Afghan War	@entity71:Nicolas Sarkozy	@entity31:Afghan Local Police	@entity30:ALP	@entity34:Paktika	@entity37:British	@entity39:Lashkar Gah	@entity101:Nangarhar Province	@entity97:Bagram Airfield	@entity127:Australian	@entity95:Qurans	@entity123:Mohammed Roozi	@entity161:Peter Bergen	@entity40:Helmand Province	@entity68:French

@placeholder : police order people to empty pockets , and if they take out pot , it is now in public view	@entity145	( @entity0 ) -- more than 50,000 people in 2011 were arrested in @entity2 for possessing small amounts of marijuana -- the majority of whom were black and @entity7 -- at a considerable judicial and financial cost . @entity2 spends about $ 75 million every year on arresting people for recreational marijuana possession . but what many people do n't know is that the state decriminalized this offense more than 30 years ago , making private possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana a violation punishable by a $ 100 fine . possession of the same amount in public view remains a criminal misdemeanor . despite this change in law , arrests for small quantities of marijuana over the last decade have skyrocketed , with more than 400,000 people arrested and unceremoniously run through the criminal justice system . marijuana possession is now the no. 1 arrest category in @entity2 . why is this happening ? each year , hundreds of thousands of people in @entity2 are stopped , questioned , frisked and searched , often without justification , under the " stop and frisk " policy . the vast majority of these people live in communities of color , and almost 90 % are immediately released without arrest or even a summons . often , however , the police approach young people and instruct them to empty their pockets immediately and show the officers anything they have . people who have a small quantity of marijuana in their pockets take it out and hold it up . the marijuana is now in public view . thousands of people are then arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession , punishable by up to three months in jail and a $ 500 fine . given the change of law in 1977 , had the marijuana remained in the person 's pocket , possession would not have been a crime at all . but in complying with a police officer 's request , otherwise noncriminal behavior is instantly transformed into an arrest and unceremonious journey through the criminal justice system . this is fundamentally unfair . many view it as classic entrapment . a majority of these arrests happen only in certain neighborhoods . indeed , compounding the injustice is the fact that 85 % of the people arrested are black and @entity7 . yet studies consistently show that younger and affluent whites use marijuana in equal if not greater numbers . the consequences of an arrest are severe , especially for young people of color who are already disproportionately subjected to criminal justice system intervention and incarceration . an arrest creates serious barriers to going to college or getting a job , and that person 's future may begin to spiral downward . the damage to police and community relations can not be overstated . another serious problem is that these needless and inappropriate arrests detract from arresting and prosecuting serious criminals . millions of dollars in law enforcement resources are wasted . thousands of lives are damaged with the contamination of having a criminal record . but @entity2 is prepared to take a significant step forward to solve this problem . with the leadership of gov. @entity112 , we are on the brink of finishing the job that the state legislature started in 1977 . we want to reduce the classification of possession of small quantities of marijuana in plain view from a misdemeanor to a violation . justice demands this change . the possession of small quantities of marijuana is either a crime or it is not . but it can not be criminal activity for one group of people and socially acceptable behavior for another when the dividing line is race . the connected and powerful -- including many in high political office -- have frequently admitted to smoking marijuana when they were young . we did n't unmercifully penalize them . we should stop needlessly criminalizing tens of thousands of our young people for doing the same thing . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .	@entity2:New York	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Latino	@entity112:Andrew Cuomo	@entity145:Jeffries
@entity76 @placeholder accuses opposition of " dictatorship and terror "	@entity75	@entity1 's ousted president is a wanted man . he 's also a missing man . @entity2 is not in @entity3 . the mayor of @entity5 , where @entity2 was saturday , says he has n't seen him in a few days . he 's also apparently not hiding in a bunker in a @entity1 @entity9 monastery , a church spokesman said , swatting down the latest speculation . @entity1 's onetime -- and , by his account , current -- president is facing a warrant for the " mass killings " of civilians . over the weekend , he fled to @entity5 , a @entity17 stronghold near the border . and he tried to board a charter plane in the eastern city of @entity21 but was turned away because he did n't have documents . in his last known public act , he delivered a televised speech saturday from @entity5 in which he rejected the parliament 's ouster and vowed to fight . " i do n't plan to leave the country . i do n't plan to resign . i am the legitimate president , " he said saturday in the televised broadcast . critics were n't impressed . " it 's a remarkable situation when the most sought - after character in the country is the president of ukraine , who is hiding and doing everything to leave the country , to avoid responsibility , " opposition leader @entity30 said monday . @entity2 's ouster and disappearance capped a weekend of dizzying developments after the parliament voted to oust @entity2 as a concession to relentless protests , which led to the deadliest violence in the country since its independence 22 years ago . former prime minister @entity47 , 53 , was freed from prison saturday after 2¬Ω years , most of them spent in a detention hospital . @entity47 , a longtime opposition leader , has accepted an invitation for medical treatment in @entity55 , her press officer @entity52 said . she will be attending a @entity57 summit there . on monday , the @entity59 continued work toward its goal of having a full interim government in place by tuesday , naming a new chief prosecutor , security service chief and central bank head . @entity59 had already named speaker @entity67 to serve as acting president . he is a longtime ally of @entity47 's . the head of @entity1 's electoral commission , @entity69 , said the campaign to elect a new president will begin tuesday , three months before the may 25 election date set by authorities . @entity76 's @entity75 criticized those elections monday , saying @entity1 's parliament was acting rashly , and accused lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic @entity76 by excluding them from the reform process . " a course has been set for suppressing those who disagree in different regions of @entity1 with methods of dictatorship and terror , " the @entity75 said . some protesters gathered monday outside the @entity1 parliament shouting " shame " in response to what they see as a lack of transparency on the part of lawmakers . @entity2 's decision to scrap a @entity99 trade deal in favor of one with @entity76 prompted the protests in november . now , the country 's new leaders have made clear that @entity3 's return to @entity106 integration will be a priority . but in doing so , they risk losing the largess that the @entity109 had bestowed on @entity2 . taking no chances , interim finance minister @entity110 proposed monday that an international donor conference be held in the next two weeks . @entity1 , he said , will need $ 35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015 . @entity2 has traditionally looked upon eastern @entity1 , near @entity76 , as his traditional support base . @entity76 culture and language are predominant there . people in the east are suspicious of the @entity106 - leaning views of those in western @entity1 , who were at the heart of the protests against @entity2 that filled central @entity3 for months . the big question : how will @entity76 president @entity125 respond ? he 's been @entity2 's chief ally , and @entity1 is in his backyard . will he act militarily ? the @entity128 has expressed support for the action of parliament . @entity128 secretary of state @entity132 spoke with the @entity76 foreign minister sunday and asked @entity76 not to use military force in the country , according to a senior @entity137 official . the @entity137 also warned @entity128 citizens to defer all nonessential travel to @entity1 . " we have been very clear that we support an independent and unified @entity1 and that the idea of separation or partition or division is not in the interest of the @entity1 people , of the @entity1 nation , of @entity106 , or @entity76 , or the @entity128 , " @entity141 spokesman @entity140 told reporters monday .

" we are not aware nor would we condone this reported activity , " a @placeholder official says	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity4 is slamming as " completely unacceptable " a @entity7 agency 's alleged collection of digital images while eavesdropping on webcam chats , a spokesperson for the internet search engine said thursday . and @entity4 says if the electronic spying took place , the online mainstay had nothing to do with it . " we are not aware nor would we condone this reported activity , " the spokesperson said following a published report by the @entity7 - based @entity17 newspaper that @entity7 's @entity18 , known as @entity18 , spied on people using @entity4 webcam chats , whether or not those users were investigative targets . according to the @entity17 report , which cites documents leaked by former @entity28 intelligence contractor @entity26 , the @entity18 collected the images under a program known as " @entity31 . " the documents show , according to the @entity17 , that the @entity18 -- with reported aid from the @entity28 -- intercepted and stored the webcam images of millions of internet users . if the report is true , it is " completely unacceptable , " the @entity4 spokesperson said . the mass collection of digital images of @entity4 users began because @entity18 targets were known to use the search engine 's webcam , the documents said , according to the @entity17 . during a six - month stretch in 2008 , the @entity18 allegedly collected images from webcam chats from 1.8 million @entity4 users globally , the newspaper reported . the still images were allegedly collected at five ` - minute intervals during the chats . one document , according to the @entity17 , compared the collection of digital images to that of a massive digital police mugshot book . @entity18 declined to speak to the allegations , citing a longstanding policy that it does not comment on intelligence matters . " furthermore , all of @entity18 's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework , which ensures that our activities are authorized , necessary and proportionate , and that there is rigorous oversight , " according to a statement released by the agency 's press office . @entity18 is not bound by the same rules that seek to limit the @entity28 collection of information on its citizens . however , according to the @entity17 , there are additional legal authorizations required before the agency can search for data on suspected targets in believed to be in @entity7 . according to the documents , there was no mechanism in place to block the collection of data on @entity89 and @entity7 citizens , the @entity17 reported . the leaked documents also allegedly provided insight into how the spy agency grappled with how to deal with the pornography it encountered in webcam chats . " unfortunately , it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate part of their body to the other person , " one document said , according to the @entity17 . the @entity18 estimated that up to 11 % of the digital images it collected from the webcam chats were explicit , the @entity17 reported , citing the leaked documents . as a result , the @entity18 allegedly warned its analysts that some of the material collected may be offensive . " user who feel uncomfortable about such material are advised not to open them , " one document said , according to the @entity17 . @entity1 's @entity112 contributed to this report .	@entity17:Guardian	@entity31:Optic Nerve	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity7:British	@entity26:Edward Snowden	@entity4:Yahoo	@entity28:NSA	@entity18:GCHQ	@entity112:Joe Sutton	@entity89:U.S.
@placeholder authorities say wheeled suitcases are a noise nuisance and cause damage to historic streets	@entity0	for years @entity0 has battled the effects of rising waters on its historic architecture , but now it 's facing a new threat -- wheeled suitcases . city officials have become so tired with the cacophony of rumbling luggage they 're introducing fines of up to 500 euros ( $ 620 ) for anyone caught using one . the move , due to come into effect in may 2015 , is likely to create a headache for many of 22 million who annually visit the city and need to cart bags to hotels in car - free streets . for locals , long tired of plastic or hard rubber wheels rattling past their windows as they try to sleep , it will come as a welcome relief . the new rules , which will require luggage to be transported on quieter air - filled tires , are the idea of city commissioner @entity35 , according to the @entity37 newspaper . ' serious discomfort ' city officials have reportedly said the noise from hard - wheeled suitcases and traders using trolleys was causing " serious discomfort . " there were also concerns about the " progressive deterioration " of historic marble steps , stone pathways and footbridges around @entity0 's old canals . the local @entity52 newspaper says the new rule will be legally binding as it 'll be written into local building code @entity35 has suggested the legislation will be an opportunity for an entrepreneurial luggage to cash in in by creating a @entity0 - friendly suitcase that runs on soft tires . whether or not the idea takes off could depend on how loud the rumblings of complaint from visitors are . do you think @entity0 is right to ban wheeled suitcases ? let us know in the comments below .	@entity52:Il Gazzettino	@entity0:Venice	@entity35:Zappalorto	@entity37:Il Messaggero
@placeholder creates a " cruise ship " in her living room when she needs to find serenity	@entity244	( @entity0 ) -- where do you go to feel a sense of gratitude , serenity or peace in your life ? while those feelings can come from a simple walk around the block or a moment with a good friend , some places inspire a sense of thankfulness by their very existence . as the nation gathers to celebrate @entity19 , some gratitude gurus tell us how they focus on thankfulness in their daily lives -- and they share the awe - inspiring spots that give them that sense of grace . heartbreaking loss inspires a new life when author and illustrator @entity30 's first husband died of cancer after a long illness , she found herself filled with gratitude for the time they had spent together and thankfulness for being alive . her gratitude for his life and hers made her want to write a book about gratitude . and when she traveled to @entity46 for a speaking engagement , the folk tales she heard and the beauty she saw further inspired her to write " @entity48 . " the children 's book is about a poor girl who over time realizes she has everything she needs to be happy . her favorite spots include the mountains of @entity56 , a neighborhood in @entity46 that means " @entity58 . " as the legends tell it , the @entity60 's @entity59 named the area after its eight tallest mountains . and the emperor was the ninth " dragon " protecting the region . hearing that story from her travel companion , " i thought that was really neat , and it sparked my first idea of putting these folk tales into the story " that became the book , she said . her latest book , " @entity76 of the @entity77 , " focuses on peace and was also inspired by her visit to @entity46 . it came upon her when she took the @entity82 cable car trip to see the @entity83 at @entity84 .

" it can be as simple as appreciating the nature around her @entity124 home , or @entity126 , a @entity128 camp in @entity130 's adirondacks where her family leaves all electronics behind . " when i watch a sunset , it 's like @entity95 hand painted the sky that night , " she says . " there will never be another one like it again . " to dig even deeper into gratitude , @entity142 has traveled to the @entity144 in @entity145 to volunteer on @entity146 . " every single day they 're doing some kind of mission work out in the community , and they will make a way for you to come out to serve , " she says .

" it may have to do with the fact that grizzly bears and mountain lions sometimes outrank humans on the food chain in @entity165 , she says . and her daily life can require skill with backhoes , chain saws and snowplows . " my life is very , very quiet and for the most part , unwitnessed , " she says . " i can wander in open spaces for miles here in the @entity196 , and not see another soul . i am grateful for @entity165 and its rugged wilderness . it has taught me about the rugged wilderness that is me . " a meditation teacher 's discoveries in @entity203 meditation teacher @entity204 lives about 10 minutes from @entity205 in rural @entity203 where he finds peace and gratitude simply by looking at the mountains from his home or taking a daily walk in nature . he loves hiking the different trails at @entity205 and finding the waterfalls tucked away in the park . the founder of the @entity218 of @entity219 , co-founder of the @entity221 and co-founder of the @entity223 , @entity204 does a traditional @entity225 meditation every day for about an hour , but he says you do n't need any training to meditate in nature .

" the two speak daily with @entity18 's wife , a @entity62 employee on essential work in @entity64 . she has told them things are still tense in the @entity9 capital -- there 's still the occasional gunfire ; roadblocks are still up ; people are hesitant to go far from their homes . but life is slowly returning to normal , with 70 percent of schools up and running , including @entity1 's school , @entity76 , @entity18 says . @entity1 's room contains her most cherished mementos of the life she left behind : some stuffed animals , medals from her accomplishments as a swimmer , photos with her parents from their adventures in @entity87 and @entity88 -- where they lived prior to @entity9 . she also brought along a small statue of @entity90 , the @entity9 pharaoh . " i do n't have a lot of statues of things , and it was small but it also reminded me of the @entity95 and how they lived through a lot of hard things , so i sort of related to them , " she says . she misses her friends , her teachers , and " all these amazing sights that most people are n't able to see . " but most of all , she says , she misses her mother . " it would have been easier for us all to adjust with my mom here because she sort of is the one who does a lot of things . she helps us shop , she helps us decorate ... and so cook . my dad 's not a very good cook . " @entity18 says that , given the situation in @entity9 , he hopes to return sometime in the next month . " we 're kind of waiting , trying to figure out what to do in the meantime . my job is to work as a single parent and take my care of my daughter .

@entity1 defeats @entity3 in the final of the @placeholder	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- wimbledon champion @entity1 out - fought @entity3 in three tough sets to win the season - ending @entity5 in @entity6 . the third seed completed a remarkable year with a 7 - 5 4 - 6 6 - 3 success over nearly two - and - a - half hours , becoming only the third woman to win the tournament on her first visit . the 21 - year - old @entity12 has been totally dominant this week , winning all three of her group games before recovering from a set down to beat @entity16 champion @entity15 in the semifinals . and this success means she now moves up to second place behind @entity21 in the world rankings , after starting 2011 down in 30th position . the never ending women 's world tennis tour @entity1 told the official @entity5 website : " it was unbelievable tennis . we were both really fighting . " every game and every set was very close . maybe i played better on the important points in the match but we both played some of our best here in @entity6 -- it was a final , so why not ! " and asked how this victory compared to her @entity40 success , @entity1 told reporters : " winning a grand slam was a very big step . i do n't know how it will be going home this time , but i think it will be similar . " i will be world number two now and next season will be different . i may be the favorite all the time , and we will have to see how i cope with that . " @entity52 of @entity53 was gracious in defeat , adding : " it 's hard to lose , but i 'm glad i lost to such a champion who deserved to win this week . " @entity57 was amazing today . she really did a great job because i gave it my all . the crowd kept me fighting all the way through -- they have been amazing all week . the match turned in the opening game of the final set when @entity3 squandered two break points on the @entity1 serve . she then took advantage of @entity3 's disappointment by making the crucial break of serve in the next game , taking the first chance she had to achieve it . it was @entity1 's sixth @entity5 title of the season and in securing victory she became the first @entity12 to lift the coveted trophy since @entity80 in 1997 . meanwhile , @entity81 has moved up to seventh place in the race to reach the climax to the men 's tennis season with a hard - fought victory over @entity88 in the final of the @entity90 in @entity91 . the top - seeded @entity92 beat the @entity94 second seed 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 4 to put himself in line for a place in the @entity98 finals in @entity99 next month . @entity88 is up to 11th place in the points chase and also still has a chance of reaching @entity99 , with more points to be had at next week 's @entity104 .	@entity21:Caroline Wozniaki	@entity80:Jana Novotna	@entity81:Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	@entity88:Del Potro	@entity3:Victoria Azarenka	@entity1:Kvitova	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Istanbul	@entity5:WTA Tour Championships	@entity53:Belarus	@entity52:Third seed Azarenka	@entity57:Petra	@entity16:U.S. Open	@entity15:Sam Stosur	@entity12:Czech	@entity104:Valencia Open	@entity99:London	@entity98:ATP Tour	@entity94:Argentine	@entity92:Frenchman	@entity91:Vienna	@entity90:Austrian Open	@entity40:Wimbledon
@entity315 says @placeholder is free to exercise power in vacuum created by fall of @entity10	@entity8	( @entity7 ) if there is one regional player that gained the most from @entity5 's gamble in @entity6 , it is @entity8 . with its invasion in 2003 , the @entity5 ousted @entity11 's sworn enemy , @entity10 , from power . then @entity13 helped install a @entity15 government for the first time in @entity6 's modern history . as @entity5 troops became mired in fighting an insurgency and containing a civil war , @entity8 extended its influence over all of @entity6 's major @entity15 factions . today , the @entity8 regime is moving to exert influence beyond its @entity6 proxies , and is comfortable taking overt military action . there is no one to restrain @entity11 , and the rise of @entity30 , which views @entity15 as apostates , threatens the interests of all @entity6 @entity15 factions and of the @entity8 regime . in late november , @entity8 warplanes launched several airstrikes against targets in eastern @entity6 , pushing back @entity30 militants who had neared a self - declared " buffer zone " that @entity8 established along the border . it was the latest example of how @entity8 is expanding its military and political influence in @entity6 , a country wracked by a complex civil war that leaves it open to outside manipulation . @entity6 is at the center of several regional proxy battles : @entity8 is heavily involved in shaping @entity6 policy , while @entity30 represents spillover from the @entity50 civil war next door . the militant group is also a byproduct of the @entity54 that support @entity56 jihadists in both @entity50 and @entity6 . and the @entity5 is bombing isis and other jihadist groups in @entity6 and @entity50 . opinion : @entity8 's hypocrisy in condemning @entity5 the @entity8 regime has several concerns : @entity6 provides strategic depth and a buffer against @entity64 and other @entity56 @entity66 states that are competing with @entity8 for dominance over the @entity68 . more broadly , @entity11 wants to ensure that @entity6 never again poses an existential threat to @entity8 interests , as @entity10 did when he invaded @entity8 in 1980 , instigating the eight - year @entity72 that devastated both countries . @entity10 was supported by the @entity74 and most western powers . ( the @entity15 are the majority in @entity6 , but since its independence in 1932 , the country had been ruled by the @entity56 minority until the @entity5 invasion in 2003 . ) @entity8 will do whatever is necessary to keep a friendly , @entity15 - led government in power in @entity84 . the long game @entity8 has excelled at playing the long game , especially in @entity6 . @entity8 's willingness to spread money around to various proxies and factions gave it great agility in maneuvering through @entity6 politics . soon after the @entity5 invasion , @entity11 reached out to the @entity15 cleric @entity93 -- who was an early critic of @entity8 meddling in @entity6 -- and financed his growing militia and social service networks . one diplomatic cable sent by @entity99 @entity98 to officials at the @entity101 in november 2009 estimated that @entity11 's financial assistance to its @entity6 surrogates ranged from $ 100 million to $ 200 million a year . @entity8 also was willing to invest across sectarian lines : " the @entity105 ( @entity106 ) recognizes that influence in @entity6 requires operational ( and at times ideological ) flexibility , " ambassador @entity98 pointed out in his cable . " as a result , it is not uncommon for the @entity105 to finance and support competing @entity15 , @entity113 , and to some extent , @entity56 entities , with the aim of developing the @entity6 body politic 's dependency on @entity11 's largesse . " like @entity6 's other neighbors , @entity8 helped fuel and prolong the @entity6 insurgency and civil war . the @entity124 financed , armed and trained numerous @entity15 militias that targeted @entity5 troops and @entity6 's @entity56 community . the @entity8 provided rockets , explosives , machine guns , sniper rifles , rocket - propelled grenades and other small arms . they also brought @entity6 militiamen to @entity8 to be trained in the use of explosives and as snipers . the @entity5 helped @entity6 's @entity15 factions compromise on @entity139 as prime minister in 2006 . as he struggled to remain in power , he became more dependent on @entity8 . he grew more repressive and authoritarian , using the @entity6 security forces to intimidate political rivals and exclude @entity56 from power . for @entity8 , @entity139 was a reliable ally , who allowed @entity8 flights over @entity6 territory to transport weapons and manpower to shore up @entity150 's regime in @entity50 after a popular uprising in 2011 . @entity139 also allowed thousands of @entity6 @entity15 to cross the border and fight alongside the @entity50 regime . since @entity30 swept through northern @entity6 in june , @entity11 has mobilized to protect the @entity15 - led government from the @entity56 militant threat . general @entity156 , commander of the @entity157 of the @entity124 , traveled to @entity84 at the start of the crisis to coordinate the defense of the capital with @entity6 politicians and military officials . he also directed @entity8 - trained @entity15 militias ‚Äî including the @entity165 and the @entity166 , two notorious militias responsible for widespread atrocities against @entity56 ‚Äî in the fight against @entity30 . with a weakened and corrupt @entity6 military , the militias have proven crucial in stopping @entity30 ' advance . when @entity6 's political elite finally agreed in august to replace the divisive and sectarian @entity139 as prime minister , the @entity8 leadership ‚Äî along with the @entity5 and most western powers ‚Äî threw their weight behind his successor , @entity179 . like @entity139 , he is a leader of the @entity180 , a @entity181 supported by @entity8 . in recent months , @entity5 officials say , @entity11 has provided tons of military equipment to the @entity6 security forces and has been secretly directing surveillance drones from an air base in @entity84 . @entity8 has also sent hundreds of its @entity157 fighters to train @entity6 forces and coordinate their actions . but last month was the first time that @entity8 used its fighter jets to directly bomb @entity30 targets inside @entity6 , striking in eastern @entity195 province where the fighting neared the @entity8 border . @entity8 officials have slowly acknowledged their covert operations inside @entity6 . " @entity8 has helped @entity6 in an advisory role and has quickly organized @entity6 militias , " gen. @entity200 , commander of the @entity124 ' @entity201 , told the @entity202 in september . " were it not for @entity8 , the @entity205 would have taken over @entity206 . " in late december , a @entity124 commander , brigadier general @entity207 , was killed by a sniper in the @entity6 city of @entity210 while he was training @entity6 troops and @entity15 militia fighters . @entity207 was the highest - ranking @entity8 official to be killed in @entity6 since the @entity72 . thousands of @entity124 gathered for his funeral in @entity11 on dec. 28 , where @entity214 , head of @entity8 's @entity215 , told mourners : if " people like @entity207 do not shed their blood in @entity210 , then we would shed our blood " within @entity8 . @entity6 leaders warned that as long as the @entity5 did not provide military assistance , they had no choice but to ask @entity8 for more help . " when @entity84 was threatened , the @entity8 did not hesitate to help us , " @entity179 , the @entity6 prime minister , said in a recent television interview in @entity84 . he noted that unlike @entity8 , the @entity5 " hesitated to help us when @entity84 was in danger , and hesitated to help our security forces . and the reason @entity8 did not hesitate to help us was because they consider @entity30 as a threat to them , not only to us . " the proxy wars today 's @entity233 was shaped by several proxy wars that unfolded over the past decade . in @entity6 , neighboring @entity56 regimes backed @entity56 militants , while @entity8 supported @entity139 's @entity15 - led government and @entity15 militias . in @entity239 , an alliance between @entity13 and authoritarian @entity56 @entity66 regimes ‚Äî @entity242 , @entity64 and other @entity68 countries ‚Äî backed a @entity56 - led government against @entity245 , a @entity15 militia funded by @entity8 . and in the @entity247 territories , @entity8 supported the militant @entity248 , while the @entity5 and its @entity66 allies backed @entity247 president @entity250 and his @entity252 movement . when various @entity233 regimes realized that @entity5 would lose its war in @entity6 , they began maneuvering to protect their interests and to gain something out of the @entity5 defeat . @entity64 , which viewed @entity6 as a bulwark against @entity8 influence , tried to undermine the @entity15 - led government in @entity84 . the ruling @entity264 dynasty views itself as the rightful leader of the @entity267 world , but @entity8 has challenged that leadership for several decades . although @entity64 has a @entity56 majority , its rulers fear @entity8 's potential influence over a sizable and sometimes - restive @entity15 population concentrated in the kingdom 's oil - rich @entity273 . in @entity277 ( another @entity5 ally in the @entity68 ) , the @entity15 majority is chafing under @entity56 rulers who also fear @entity8 's reach . through a combination of funding , training for militias and political support , @entity8 will continue to extend its influence over the major @entity15 groups in @entity6 . @entity139 did not start out as beholden to @entity8 , but as he struggled to remain in power , he became more dependent on @entity11 . even if @entity179 , the new prime minister , has shown signs that he wants to be closer to the @entity291 , he needs @entity8 support to keep his government in power . more broadly , the @entity5 and @entity8 now share common interests in defeating @entity30 and maintaining a stable regime in @entity84 that can transcend sectarian conflicts . the @entity298 administration and @entity11 insist that they are not coordinating directly in @entity6 , but they essentially have an undeclared alliance . @entity13 has been looking the other way as @entity8 increased its military involvement over the past six months . without committing far more @entity5 troops and resources , there is little that the @entity298 administration can do to contain @entity8 power in @entity6 . @entity8 has many levers to maintain its influence over @entity6 . it will not hesitate to use them , even if that means taking on a deeper military role in a civil war that has no end in sight .	@entity239:Lebanon	@entity99:U.S. Ambassador to Iraq	@entity250:Mahmoud Abbas	@entity252:Fatah	@entity84:Baghdad	@entity202:Fars News Agency	@entity277:Bahrain	@entity150:Bashar al-Assad	@entity157:Quds Force	@entity273:Eastern Province	@entity214:Ali Shamkhani	@entity215:Supreme National Security Council	@entity7:CNN	@entity6:Iraq	@entity5:U.S.	@entity179:Abadi	@entity93:Muqtada al-Sadr	@entity195:Diyala	@entity8:Iran	@entity156:Qassim Suleimani	@entity50:Syrian	@entity298:Obama	@entity56:Sunni	@entity54:Gulf Arab states	@entity74:Sunni Arab states	@entity291:West	@entity72:Iran-Iraq war	@entity30:ISIS	@entity15:Shiite	@entity13:Washington	@entity11:Tehran	@entity10:Saddam Hussein	@entity66:Arab	@entity210:Samarra	@entity233:Middle Eastern	@entity247:Palestinian	@entity101:State Department	@entity245:Hezbollah	@entity267:Muslim	@entity105:IRIG	@entity106:Islamic Republic of Iran Government	@entity98:Hill	@entity264:Al-Saud	@entity201:Aerospace Forces	@entity200:Amir Ali Hajizadeh	@entity207:Taqavi	@entity206:Iraqi Kurdistan	@entity205:Islamic State	@entity248:Hamas	@entity166:League of the Righteous	@entity64:Saudi Arabia	@entity165:Badr Brigade	@entity180:Dawa Party	@entity181:Shiite Islamist group	@entity315:Mohamad Bazzi	@entity68:Gulf	@entity124:Revolutionary Guards	@entity139:Maliki	@entity113:Kurdish	@entity242:Egypt
in recent years , @placeholder refugees have fled into @entity1 seeking food , jobs , freedom	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 , formally called the @entity3 , is also known as the @entity4 for a good reason . @entity1 border guards patrol in @entity7 across from the @entity3 border on march 21 , 2009 . for decades , it has been shrouded by a veil of secrecy that has prevented us from better understanding this important nation . as journalists we seek out the realities of life there , beyond the myths and hype , but that is difficult because the @entity3 is generally inaccessible to journalists . the gap between reality and illusion remains profound . journalists , such as the two @entity26 being detained in @entity3 , do travel to the border between @entity1 and @entity3 to get a sense of what life is like in the isolated nation of 22 million people . the circumstances surrounding the journalists ' arrest are still unclear . " @entity3 is such a difficult country to enter for a foreign reporter that the temptation to slip across the frozen river border is considerable , " said former @entity2 correspondent @entity36 , author of " meltdown : the @entity41 of the @entity42 . " " if that 's what they did , however , it was extremely foolhardy and really pushing their luck . " @entity1 and @entity3 share a 1,415 - kilometer ( 880 - mile ) border that mainly follows two rivers . the @entity51 defines the border on the northwest , the @entity54 on the northeast . by land , the two countries are linked by seven road crossings and four railway points . over the years , i have visited three towns on the @entity1 side of the border . from a narrow river crossing at the border town of @entity54 , @entity3 cross on foot and in trucks . those going back into @entity3 carry bags full of food and household wares , even bicycles . some of those coming into @entity1 ferry logs and minerals . from across the @entity51 in @entity1 's @entity76 in october of 2006 , i had a glimpse of @entity78 , a @entity3 border town of some 350,000 people . using a long camera lens , i saw school children learn to roller skate , and residents celebrating what looked like a wedding . still the city 's decrepit appearance hinted at stagnation and isolation . it was a stark contrast from the @entity1 city , which was ablaze in neon lights and a bustling commerce and trade . @entity3 's public face is one of smiling children , clean streets , manicured gardens , spectacular scenery and a stoic people united under the aegis of @entity104 , known among @entity3 as the " dear leader . " i saw it up close twice , in 1996 and 2002 , when i had the chance to visit the most reclusive nation on earth . we were typically greeted by polite officials and smiling children and invited to watch spectacular performances with a cast of thousands . @entity3 , however , remains isolated , diplomatically and economically , led by an erratic leadership that behaves out of fear and insecurity . diplomatic sources in @entity0 suggest that @entity1 is getting fed up with @entity3 's inability to preserve social stability and with its erratic behavior in the multi-national efforts to deal with @entity3 's nuclear program . publicly , however , @entity1 sticks to the official line , often calling the two nations ' ties as close as " lips and teeth " -- one can not function without the other . in my two visits to @entity3 , i have detected conflicting signs -- one , of social instability and another of a tentative desire to experiment with reforms . in 2002 , the government tolerated some quasi-private businesses , raised civil servants ' salaries and deregulated prices of some commodities . but much of these tentative efforts to change seem to have been aborted and the country remains isolated and poor . what emerges is a nation , now considered a nuclear threat , desperately seeking respect and economic aid . that picture is now intertwined with the two detained @entity26 journalists , @entity36 said . " it will be interesting to see how the case is handled . @entity3 has been in a generally more bellicose mood lately , " said @entity36 , who is currently a senior fellow at the @entity152 . " the concern is that this incident could get caught up in the bigger picture of heightened tension between the north and the @entity26 and the north and south . if it is not swiftly resolved , it will add to the complexity of the situation facing [ @entity26 president @entity163 ] @entity163 , where he is under pressure from @entity165 , @entity166 and some in @entity167 to get tough , while trying to find a way to get diplomacy with the @entity3 going again . " in recent years , waves of @entity3 refugees have fled into @entity1 seeking food , jobs and freedom . in the border cities of @entity54 , @entity177 and @entity76 , these refugees tell of misery and persecution . they live under the protection of relatives , friends and human rights activists . here , people speak of a @entity3 " underground railways " -- a network that smuggles desperate people across the border and eventually out of @entity1 . @entity1 is struggling to keep out the hundreds of @entity3 immigrants and refugees , but stopping the exodus remains a tall order . a fundamental solution , analysts suggest , lies not in @entity1 but in @entity3 , where many people are running away from humanitarian disasters and political persecution .	@entity3:North Korea	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:China	@entity0:Beijing	@entity7:Jilin province	@entity167:Washington	@entity177:Yanji	@entity4:Hermit Kingdom	@entity163:Obama	@entity166:Tokyo	@entity36:Chinoy	@entity76:Dandong	@entity51:Yalu River	@entity104:Kim Jong Il	@entity41:Inside Story	@entity42:North Korean Nuclear Crisis	@entity165:Seoul	@entity152:Pacific Council on International Policy	@entity26:U.S.	@entity54:Tumen	@entity78:Sinuiju

@entity7 is one of four finalists in a bid for @placeholder 's presidential library	@entity4	the hunt to become the home of @entity4 's lasting @entity3 legacy has become a game of presidential library survivor . for now , the president 's native @entity7 can only hope , to borrow a phrase , that it is not voted off the island . " i would just note that the president chooses to spend his winters in @entity19 , not @entity20 , " said @entity7 's recently elected gov. @entity12 , who touted the islands ' appeal as the @entity16 's annual refuge during the holiday season . still , @entity12 acknowledged his state is an underdog in its competition with the three other remaining proposed bids to win the multimillion dollar project : two in @entity20 and one in @entity27 . " @entity7 has been the underdog before . we trust the president and the foundation will make the best decision , " @entity12 added during an interview at his office in the state capitol . in between rounds of golf , the president conceivably has had time to decide where to place his library . but @entity3 officials declined to comment on whether any meetings on the topic have occurred over his winter vacation in @entity7 . in many respects , @entity7 's proposed @entity19 site is a strong contender . the eight - acre parcel of land is on the city 's spectacular waterfront , looking out on @entity52 and @entity55 's iconic @entity54 peak . another perk , @entity12 noted , is that this slice of paradise is already owned by the state . there are , however , some potential drawbacks to @entity19 . set apart from the @entity63 mainland , @entity7 is hardly a convenient place to preserve presidential documents . presidential libraries are intended for researchers and historians , not foreign tourists and families on vacation , a source close to @entity7 's bid conceded . another potential obstacle is that a sizable portion of the site has been transformed into a tent village by dozens of @entity19 's homeless , including women and children who would be forced to move to another part of the city . a homeless woman who called herself " @entity84 " said the tent village is buzzing with rumors the city will push out the area 's inhabitants to make way for development . " now we know why we got to leave . i have no problem that they want to make a library . but where is the rest of everyone going ? " she asked . @entity84 suggested @entity4 pay the area a visit . " he should come back and take a look . it 's like they 're trying to hide us back here , trying to shove us back here , " she added . there is a sense of resignation in the tent village that the waterfront area may well be selected as the home of the @entity114 . " i guess he can do whatever he wants to do . he 's the president . i better keep quiet . i might offend people , " said another woman , who asked to be identified only as @entity118 , as she served hot meals to homeless people out of the back of her car . @entity19 city officials explain the homeless tent village on the city 's proposed library site will have to be moved either way , as developers have plans for new construction , with or without a presidential museum . despite those issues , @entity19 's prospects did receive a possible boost this week from the city once considered the front - runner to host the presidential library , @entity4 's adopted hometown of @entity20 . the @entity140 , which has been tasked to lead the library search , has raised " major " concerns about the two proposals coming from @entity20 , according to sources familiar with the selection process . foundation officials are alarmed that the sites included in a pitch from the @entity149 are controlled by city @entity151 officials . the foundation would rather have the university in charge of the land in order to ease construction . concerns with a separate proposal from the @entity161 stem from upcoming leadership changes there . the city of @entity20 is urgently working to remedy the problems with the @entity149 proposal by clarifying how the land can be used , said an aide to mayor @entity169 , @entity4 's former @entity3 chief of staff . but city officials concede there is little they can do about the @entity161 ' issues . in an indication of how fierce the library competition has become , @entity7 's governor grinned upon hearing about @entity20 's problems , describing them as " terrific " for his own state 's prospects . the other remaining contender for the library , @entity182 in @entity27 , may be benefiting from the issues plaguing the @entity19 and @entity20 bids . one sticking point in selecting @entity188 's upper - @entity187 neighborhood : it already boasts one ex-president , @entity190 , who keeps an office there . for now , the @entity140 is taking a restrained approach in commenting on the looming decision that the president and first lady are expected to make in early 2015 . " the foundation is evaluating all four respondents across a variety of criteria . each institution is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses relative to the others , " the foundation said . with the president and first family still in @entity55 , @entity19 mayor @entity206 is hoping to give the @entity209 his best pitch before they return to @entity211 . he plans to see the @entity209 off on the tarmac at @entity213 when they fly out this weekend , though will only raise the library if the feeling is right . " any time i get with the president , i will try my best to make a plug for our site , " he said . " but i want to send him off with aloha . " acknowledging @entity7 's long odds to win the selection process , @entity12 and @entity206 are both suggesting an alternative proposal of splitting @entity4 's post-presidential home , with the official library in either @entity20 or @entity27 and a separate presidential center in @entity19 . @entity206 said he has joked with @entity169 , @entity20 's outspoken mayor , about the library competition . " i 've joked around a little bit with @entity169 , and there 's a chance we share parts of it , " @entity206 said . " but i do believe for people to truly understand the president they have to understand this place , " he added . while @entity7 is certainly remote , @entity12 noted the islands already act as a cultural bridge between the @entity63 and @entity242 . add to that the state 's large @entity244 - @entity63 population , and a @entity7 presidential library would neatly reflect @entity4 's goal of pivoting @entity63 foreign policy to @entity242 , @entity12 argued . " we believe the presidential center would allow the president to really showcase what he believes as we move forward , " @entity12 said . " the multicultural fabric of @entity7 is such a profound statement of his desires , " he added . ‚Äã	@entity20:Chicago	@entity169:Rahm Emanuel	@entity27:New York	@entity114:Barack Obama Presidential Library	@entity84:Bernie	@entity151:Park District	@entity118:Grace	@entity3:White House	@entity7:Hawaii	@entity211:Washington	@entity213:Hickam Field	@entity190:Bill Clinton	@entity52:Waikiki Beach	@entity55:Oahu	@entity54:Diamond Head	@entity16:First Family	@entity12:Ige	@entity19:Honolulu	@entity209:Obamas	@entity244:Asian	@entity242:Asia	@entity206:Caldwell	@entity188:Columbia	@entity161:University of Illinois	@entity140:Obama Foundation	@entity182:Columbia University	@entity4:Obama	@entity149:University of Chicago	@entity187:Manhattan	@entity63:U.S.
@entity14 's @entity13 leads from @placeholder driver @entity134	@entity31	@entity1 motorsport maestros @entity2 want to get back to being " bellissimo " in @entity3 next month after two team errors saw their no. 1 driver @entity5 fall behind in the race for the @entity8 title . @entity5 dropped to fourth in the drivers ' championship -- and 30 points behind the leader , @entity14 's reigning champion @entity13 -- after his race in @entity16 was compromised by problems with his car 's rear - wing overtaking aid . the @entity20 also crashed out of the @entity22 @entity21 when the team failed to call him back to the pits to repair a damaged front wing that had slipped dangerously underneath his car . the mistakes mean @entity2 -- who have not won the team title since 2008 -- are now third in the constructor standings behind @entity14 and @entity31 . after the first four long - haul destination races of 2013 , the team have returned to their @entity35 headquarters in northern @entity1 where team principal @entity36 has issued a rallying call to the famous racing marque . " we have to be perfect in every area , " he said . " responsibility lies with reliability , from the smallest to the biggest components , to ensure the level of perfection that has to be the standard for @entity2 . we must work with renewed attention on this front . " that extra attention to detail has already begun at the @entity2 factory as the team 's engineers solved the problem with @entity5 's faulty drag reduction system ( @entity56 ) -- an overtaking aid which increases the car 's straight - line speed by flipping open the top flap of the rear wing -- the day after the @entity62 . analysis revealed the problem was caused by a broken mechanical component . @entity2 say it was the first of its kind in the three years since @entity56 was introduced to @entity8 . but the team say there is still work to be done , especially as @entity2 's @entity71 driver @entity70 also had a torrid race in @entity16 , finishing 15th because of tire problems . @entity5 had started the race in third place but battled his way to eighth after stopping twice so mechanics could mend his car 's faulty rear wing . " it 's hard to recall a race where so many things went wrong , " commented @entity80 . " the @entity56 failure prevented @entity5 , who yet again produced a great performance , from fighting @entity13 for the win . " then for @entity70 , there were the two tire - related problems that pushed him out of the points and prevented him from getting the top - five finish that was within his grasp . " in these first four races of the season we have not managed , for various reasons , to bring home the points that were within our grasp . that 's why the gap to the top in both classifications seems quite large . " strong performances in @entity103 and @entity104 , where @entity5 raced to a dominant victory for @entity2 , continue to give @entity2 hope that they can still challenge their main rivals @entity14 , @entity31 and @entity108 in the title hunt when racing resumes in the @entity112 city of @entity3 on may 12 . " we believe in our ability to be in the fight for the titles right to the end and this time , we have been in that fight since the start , which has not been the case for a while , " said @entity80 . " we must not be discouraged , quite the contrary , because we have seen so often , both in our favor and against , how things can change in a hurry .

@entity17 praise tough @placeholder line on radical @entity53	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) he ousted @entity4 's first democratically elected president in a coup , crushed political dissent , let foreign journalists languish in jail and just jabbed the @entity9 by greeting @entity10 as a hero . yet @entity4 's president @entity12 is fast becoming the favorite @entity14 strongman of @entity9 conservatives and @entity17 presidential hopefuls . @entity18 says he ca n't understand why the @entity19 has told @entity20 " you 're not on our team " as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the @entity14 . @entity25 , another @entity17 2016 pretender has also praised him , and key conservative media figures are lionizing @entity20 . the rush of affection for the former army chief contrasts with the strained relationship between @entity20 and the @entity19 , reflected in the @entity34 administration 's decision not to publicly back air strikes by @entity4 on a common enemy -- @entity37 -- in @entity38 this week . it 's also the latest manifestation of the decades - long tussle between the @entity9 and @entity4 , which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro- @entity9 partner in a chaotic region , whatever the character of its regime . the spur for the conservative infatuation for @entity20 was a speech in january in which the @entity4 leader warned @entity53 was being " torn " and " destroyed " by extremism . " it 's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire @entity53 world to be a source of anxiety , danger , killing and destruction for the rest of the world , " said @entity20 . @entity20 spoke in a highly symbolic venue , the @entity66 in @entity67 , one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the @entity53 world . " it 's antagonizing the entire world ! does this mean that 1.6 billion people ( @entity75 ) should want to kill the rest of the world 's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live ? impossible ! ‚Äã " on the face of it , @entity20 's speech was a call to cleanse @entity53 of extremist thought and elements which groups like @entity37 and @entity88 have used to justify jihad . it continues to impress conservatives in the @entity9 amid a fierce political debate about how to contain @entity37 's march across the region . " he gave this incredible speech about @entity53 extremism , and saying it 's the responsibility of the @entity101 world to step up to fight this ; that the first risks are for countries like @entity4 , " @entity18 said in @entity95 on wednesday . it 's no coincidence that @entity17 are praising the speech 's blunt message at the same time as they are accusing president @entity34 of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the @entity9 is at war with radical @entity53 . that comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio . @entity25 also praised @entity20 on @entity114 on wednesday . " what would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by president @entity12 in @entity67 , " @entity25 said . " why do n't we see the president of the @entity9 demonstrating that same courage , just to speak the truth , about the face of evil we are facing right now ? " @entity25 asked . @entity124 , another potential @entity17 presidential contender , said " thank @entity125 for president @entity12 in @entity4 " in an interview with @entity127 . @entity129 leader @entity128 wrote in @entity130 that the @entity20 speech could be as historically resonant as @entity132 's " @entity136 " speech or president @entity134 's declaration : " @entity137 . " conservative commentator @entity138 said on @entity139 last month that @entity20 may deserve the @entity140 . but are @entity9 political figures ripping a speech redolent with @entity4 political overtones out of context to back up their own positions ? professor @entity146 of @entity147 said that @entity20 's remarks were not that unusual and that a number of @entity101 leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect . " it is standard stuff , " he said . and @entity20 's record toward political opponents and extremists , especially the @entity158 , which formed @entity4 's first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013 , paints a different picture of the @entity4 leader . " the way that @entity20 represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response , " said @entity146 , who is also with the @entity165 . " that is what he represents . that part of the message gets lost . " the @entity175 and rights groups fault @entity4 for the removal of a civilian government , using lethal force to disburse @entity158 protests , and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against @entity183 and @entity184 in @entity4 remains widespread . some analysts interpreted @entity20 's speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of @entity191 elements from political life in @entity4 following his landslide win in an election last year in which the @entity158 was banned . since the election , the @entity34 administration has tried to carefully restore ties with @entity4 on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner . secretary of state @entity203 visited @entity67 in september and @entity34 met @entity20 on the sidelines of the @entity205 in @entity206 last year . close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes . but relations have remained strained . after the coup the @entity9 temporarily held up a tranch of $ 500 million in military aid to @entity4 and an order of attack helicopters . reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in @entity4 of foreign journalists . the spectacle of @entity10 getting a warm welcome from @entity20 in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in @entity0 , and was an apparent sign from the @entity67 government that if the @entity9 does not take better care of its friends , @entity4 will look elsewhere . the @entity225 , meanwhile , said it was not even told in advance about @entity4 air strikes this week on @entity37 targets in @entity38 in revenge for the beheadings of 21 @entity4 @entity233 workers by an @entity37 - affiliated group . " it 's a complex relationship that we have with @entity4 , " said @entity225 spokesman @entity235 . @entity37 's swift spread in the @entity101 world has some realists in @entity0 considering whether it 's time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the @entity9 relationship with @entity67 . @entity18 suggested as much on wednesday , in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother , @entity245 , angered the government of then @entity4 president @entity247 by issuing a call for democracy in the @entity101 world as part of its @entity251 . @entity18 asked wednesday : " is ( @entity20 ) a little " l " liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do ? " " no , he is n't . but i think we have to be practical , " @entity18 said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster @entity9 - @entity4 relationship . " we have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the @entity4 to garner more freedom .

the @placeholder - controlled @entity9 passed a more narrowly tailored bill to restore a few expired programs	@entity10	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 adjourned for the summer on thursday without passing a relief package for farmers and ranchers suffering through the most widespread drought since the 1930s . the only thing the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 and the @entity12 - controlled @entity11 have agreed on is that they 'll take the issue up again after @entity15 . " we need drought assistance , but instead we 're just going to sit here in gridlock , " said @entity16 , executive vice president of the @entity17 . " it 's kind of disappointing . " little hope for worsening drought in @entity25 most farmers devastated by the drought are getting help from federally assisted insurance policies . but a number of livestock producers are in serious trouble . why ? a decision by @entity2 four years ago to pass a five - year farm bill that eliminated key federal livestock support programs in 2012 instead of 2013 . @entity2 " had it expire because they wanted the gimmick to keep the cost of the last farm bill down , " said @entity36 , vice president of the group @entity37 . now , in the midst of a brutal drought , " it turned around and really bit them in the behind . " feeling pressure to do something before leaving @entity0 for the summer , @entity9 @entity10 leaders managed to pass a narrowly tailored $ 383 million disaster relief bill restoring expired programs for livestock , certain trees , honeybees and farm - raised fish . the measure , funded by cutting spending on conservation programs , passed in a 223 - 197 vote . thirty - five @entity62 backed the measure , while 46 @entity10 opposed it . rank - and - file @entity62 were quick to note that @entity9 @entity10 came to power in the 2010 election promising reform , not fast fixes . more @entity2 : @entity2 closes loophole in stock trading law after @entity1 report " you want to hand ( money ) out to whoever comes to town and begs for it , go right ahead , " said rep. @entity72 , @entity73 . " i have some rooftop terrace restaurants in my district . give them some while you 're at it . that 's not a solution ( to ) the underlying problem . " in june , the @entity11 passed a comprehensive new five - year farm bill renewing the livestock programs in question while cutting the deficit by roughly $ 23 billion . the bill cuts the deficit through reforms such as the replacement of direct payments to farmers with more taxpayer - subsidized crop insurance for farmers in need . the measure passed in a rare bipartisan 64 - 35 vote . the @entity9 @entity10 , however , remains sharply split on the merits of such a bill . a similar multiyear measure passed the @entity104 but has since stalled . some tea party conservatives want to cut spending more deeply , while a number of @entity108 -- fearing political vulnerability and constituent pressure -- continue to push hard for immediate federal relief for livestock producers . @entity113 : drought has made more than half of @entity25 counties disaster zones " our livestock guys take just as much risk as any other farmer or rancher out there , and they need to have some kind of protection in situations like these , " freshman rep. @entity117 , @entity118 , told @entity1 . " we ca n't gamble with people 's lives and businesses . " speaker @entity132 , @entity133 , admitted this week that " the @entity9 is pretty well divided " on the issue . " frankly , " he told reporters , " i have n't seen ( a majority of ) 218 votes in the middle to pass a farm bill . " @entity62 , with the backing of groups such as the @entity17 , have shown little willingness to adopt the narrower @entity9 plan and abandon their multiyear farm measure . " if we get out in the real world , that 's not what we 're hearing from farmers and ranchers , " said @entity146 chairwoman @entity145 , @entity147 . " they want us to get our job done . they want a five - year farm bill . they want us to address disaster assistance . i intend to do both . " livestock producers caught in a @entity164 crunch stressing the need to provide " long - term certainty , " @entity145 urged the @entity9 to pass a full farm bill and work out its differences with the @entity11 . she blasted @entity9 @entity10 for " trying to play politics . " for their part , consumers can count on rising food prices next year if @entity2 does nothing , @entity16 told @entity1 . he urged the @entity9 to adopt a plan similar to the @entity11 's . the @entity9 approach is to " kick the can " down the road , he said .

@entity219 : @placeholder cell is similar to embryonic stem cell but cheaper , kills no embryos	@entity89	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- as you turn on your hdtv and watch the endless controversy over embryonic stem cell research , ask yourself : should the government spend taxpayer dollars to develop that bulky old cathode - ray television you once owned ? as you install your $ 79 blu - ray player , what if @entity11 was paying millions to develop @entity13 videotapes ? this kind of government waste is what embryonic stem cell researchers are demanding even when science itself , according to scientists such as former nih director @entity19 , has made embryonic stem cell research obsolete . yet the @entity23 is appealing a recent federal court ruling that stopped funding of embryonic stem cell research because it was contrary to @entity28 ' 1995 law that decided to spend tax dollars on projects that produce treatments instead of destroyed embryos . this is a far - from - baseless ethical concern , as it is tied to the fact that an embryo is a genetically distinct human being from the moment of conception . in denying the administration 's request for a stay , the court rightly found , " defendants are incorrect about much of their ' parade of horribles ' that will supposedly result from this court 's preliminary injunction . @entity28 has mandated that the public interest is served by preventing taxpayer funding of research that entails the destruction of human embryos . " nonetheless , upon being given a short temporary stay by the appeals court while it receives briefs in the case , the @entity54 immediately began spending @entity60 taxpayer dollars like a drunken sailor on 24 - hour shore leave . another view : court ruling a blow to @entity60 science human embryonic stem cell research is the $ 10,000 toilet seat of the 21st century . years ago , science created a cell that appears to be , in the words of an @entity73 study published last month , " virtually identical " to an embryonic stem cell but is cheaper , promises better compatibility to patients and kills no embryos . these new induced pluripotent stem cells ( @entity84 ) " do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " explains the father of human embryonic stem cells @entity80 . @entity86 's @entity85 agrees that @entity89 technology " is absolutely changing the field . " @entity96 " perhaps even eliminate the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells , " says @entity90 of the @entity91 . @entity97 even caused the man who cloned @entity99 the sheep to abandon cloning three years ago because " changing cells from a patient directly into stem cells has got so much more potential . " " the world has changed , " @entity80 told the @entity104 in 2007 . " human embryo stem cell research will be abandoned by more and more labs . " but not by people who put politics over science . for some , " virtually identical " is just not enough . although all researchers agree or admit @entity84 are a promising development worthy of ongoing research , embryonic stem cell research advocates still want to take millions of taxpayer dollars away from that more promising research to fuel their less promising research . with the help of @entity0 politicians , they 're holding taxpayer dollars hostage to the tune of $ 300 million spent and pledged in just over a year . perhaps that 's one reason why , during these times of intense economic strain , a new @entity124 poll shows that only 33 percent of @entity60 voters believe that taxpayer money should be spent on embryonic stem cell research . talking heads promote embryonic cells by alleging a " potential " for cures , but money is much better spent on @entity84 . stem cell research that destroys human embryos is also taking money away from successful adult stem cell work , in which no embryos are destroyed . found in people already born , adult stem cells are the only cells with a track record of actually and successfully treating patients . adult stem cells have grown new corneas and tracheas , restoring sight and speech . adult stem cells placed into children have repaired damage from fatal genetic skin diseases . as @entity153 reported on august 2 , adult stem cells appear to have the ability to stimulate tissue repair and to suppress the immune system . " that gives adult stem cells really a very interesting and potent quality that embryonic stem cells do n't have , " said @entity157 , director of a cellular engineering institute at the @entity159 . meanwhile , embryonic stem cell researchers have produced no treatments at all . their own technology dates back to the @entity167 in today 's pace of science , whereas this year 's prestigious @entity170 for biology recently went to @entity89 pioneer @entity172 . so , like many failed industries , embryo researchers demand a taxpayer bailout . they claim that they 're too big to fail , when in fact they 've never succeeded . @entity54 director @entity179 melodramatically announced that the district court 's injunction against his funding of embryonic stem cell research , in spite of the 1995 law against such funding , " poured sand into the engine of discovery . " the problem is that @entity179 is wasting taxpayer money on " discovering " the equivalent of the riverboat steam engine . advocates for embryo - destructive research respond that the government should fund all research -- if any money is left over after they get theirs . but @entity60 taxpayers are not a bottomless grab - bag of cash . they should not be forced to waste precious dollars on partisan science , especially when economic ruin fueled by government waste is a looming specter . embryonic stem cell research should go into the dinosaur museum where it belongs . any funding should be focused on the real , clean promise of @entity84 and on the miracles that are being produced today by adult stem cell treatments . embryo destruction has sidetracked good stem cell research long enough . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .	@entity23:Obama Justice Department	@entity28:Congress	@entity80:Thomson	@entity159:University of Pittsburgh	@entity84:iPSCs	@entity85:David Scadden	@entity86:Harvard	@entity153:CBS News	@entity89:iPSC	@entity157:Rocky Tuan	@entity170:Balzan Prize	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity179:Collins	@entity219:Bowman	@entity54:NIH	@entity73:MIT	@entity13:Betamax	@entity11:Uncle Sam	@entity19:Bernadine Healy	@entity217:Matt Bowman	@entity172:Shinya Yamanaka	@entity104:Boston Globe	@entity99:Dolly	@entity97:IPSCs	@entity96:IPSCs	@entity124:Rasmussen	@entity91:University of Edinburgh	@entity90:Keisuke Kaji	@entity167:Stone Age	@entity60:American
border skirmish between @entity6 and @placeholder forces in @entity130 weigh on relations	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- it is the most high - profile meeting in all of @entity3 this year . @entity5 's president @entity4 will spend three days in @entity6 on an official state visit this week , getting a considerable amount of time with @entity10 , @entity6 's new prime minister . the two leaders represent not only the two most populous countries on @entity13 -- accounting for a third of the world 's population -- they are also the faces of stark changes in their home countries . both are new , strong , willful leaders with an agenda for reform . both have made moves to attack a culture of corruption , and to build their economies . and both seem to have designs on being stronger players in their backyards . what will their meeting mean for relations between these two @entity3 giants ? made in @entity5 & @entity6 in an editorial published in the @entity38 newspaper wednesday , @entity5 's @entity4 described how his country could exchange its expertise in infrastructure and manufacturing for @entity6 's advancements in information technology and pharmaceuticals . " the combination of ' the world 's factory ' and ' the world 's back office ' will produce the most competitive production base and the most attractive consumer market , " wrote @entity46 would be an upgrade in current relations , where @entity5 has a significant surplus in bilateral trade . @entity10 , in turn , in a press conference tuesday talked up the potential of a great partnership : " whenever @entity6 and @entity5 have worked and grown together , this has also led to the development and economic prosperity of the world , " he said . there are indeed a number of potential synergies . and @entity6 has much to learn from @entity5 , as i 've written previously . according to the @entity71 's latest @entity70 -- an indicator of how business friendly a country is -- @entity5 places 28th in the world for overall competitiveness ; @entity6 ranks 71st . on infrastructure and macroeconomic environment , @entity5 ranks 46th and 10th respectively ; @entity6 tanks 87th and 101st . in many of his recent speeches , @entity10 has referred to @entity6 's rotting infrastructure . supply chains are broken ; institutions are inefficient ; large swathes of @entity6 are disconnected from modernity . @entity6 needs money and expertise to fix these problems . that 's where @entity5 could come in . one of the expected headlines from @entity4 's visit is an announcement to the effect of $ 100 billion of @entity5 investment into @entity6 . if that actually happens , the world 's two biggest countries by population could finally begin to realize the potential of their partnership . @entity5 may be @entity6 's biggest trading partner , but @entity5 counts @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , and even @entity107 as more important partners right now . given the the two countries share a large border , @entity6 will want that status to change . for @entity5 , too , there are clear upsides to increasing trade with a neighbor that has growing economic needs and clout . regional aspirations beyond the rhetoric of business camaraderie , there are fears the two country 's regional aspirations could represent a hurdle . @entity6 media reported on tuesday a minor border skirmish between @entity6 and @entity5 forces in @entity130 . while border scuffles between the two countries have been largely quelled since @entity6 and @entity5 fought a war in 1962 , both sides have made foreign policy moves that have caused angst . in the past week alone , @entity5 's @entity4 visited , for the first time , the @entity137 and @entity138 . in both countries -- close neighbors of @entity6 's -- @entity4 announced large - scale infrastructure projects and deepened ties . many @entity6 analysts see @entity5 's economic encircling of @entity6 as something to be wary of . but meanwhile , @entity6 itself has made moves that have irked the @entity5 . @entity6 's president @entity148 visited @entity149 this week , calling the ties between the two countries historic and " infinite . " @entity149 has long had turbulent relations with @entity5 . and earlier this month , much was made of @entity10 's five - day visit to @entity105 . both sides announced increased trade and investment , and have held joint military exercises -- a clear signal to @entity5 that it wo n't have a clear route to supremacy in @entity3 . hedging bets both @entity4 and @entity10 seem to be foreign policy realists , pragmatic in their world view and partnerships . in his aforementioned column this week , @entity4 spoke of a world moving towards " multipolarity " -- a reference to the dwindling influence of the @entity104 , and the increasingly important role of @entity5 and @entity6 . if both leaders abide by that theme , then their focus for the next few months and years will be not on rocking the boat on military or defense , but on building their respective economies . for both @entity10 and @entity4 , foreign policy begins at home . for that , they will need each others ' cooperation .	@entity138:Sri Lanka	@entity137:Maldives	@entity130:Ladakh	@entity3:Asia	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:New Delhi	@entity6:Indian	@entity5:Chinese	@entity4:Xi	@entity71:World Economic Forum	@entity70:Global Competitiveness Rankings	@entity13:Earth	@entity10:Narendra Modi	@entity38:Hindu	@entity103:Europe	@entity104:United States	@entity105:Japan	@entity106:South Korea	@entity107:Brazil	@entity148:Pranab Mukherjee	@entity149:Vietnam	@entity46:Xi.

@entity13 made a surprise visit to the @placeholder rebel stronghold of @entity0 on friday	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 opposition leaders received a major morale boost friday when a top @entity6 senator made a surprise visit to the rebel stronghold of @entity0 and urged greater @entity6 involvement in the bloody campaign to oust strongman @entity11 . the visit from sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , came a day after the @entity6 said it was deploying predator drones to @entity1 . @entity13 said the drones would increase @entity18 's capability in the war - torn @entity20 country , but not enough to make up a shortfall in assets needed to break a " significant degree of stalemate . " he said he was against @entity6 troops on the ground -- echoing @entity29 administration policy -- but argued that @entity31 powers need to do more to " facilitate " the delivery of weapons and training for the rebels . " we have prevented the worst outcome in @entity1 , " @entity13 told reporters . " now we need to increase our support so that the @entity1 people can achieve the only satisfactory outcome to this mass protest for universal rights -- the end of @entity11 's rule and the beginning of a peaceful and inclusive transition to democracy that will benefit all @entity1 . " @entity13 , the top @entity49 on the @entity50 , is a former presidential nominee and decorated @entity52 veteran . the five - term senator is considered a senior congressional spokesman on military and foreign policy matters . @entity13 is the highest - ranking @entity6 official to visit @entity1 since the conflict erupted in february . during his visit , he challenged critics of @entity18 's intervention to tour @entity0 and see a " powerful and hopeful example of what a free @entity1 can be . " the senator was greeted by a crowd of roughly 100 @entity1 waving @entity6 flags . " thank you @entity13 ! thank you @entity29 , " people chanted . " thank you @entity6 ! we need freedom ! @entity11 go away ! " @entity13 visited @entity0 's @entity69 , accompanied by , among others , @entity71 , deputy chairman of the opposition @entity72 . he paused at a courthouse wall covered with scores of pictures of people allegedly killed by @entity11 's forces and others who have gone missing since uprisings began . " the @entity6 people support you very strongly , and we know it 's necessary to help as much as we can , " @entity13 told a woman who thanked him for @entity6 support . as @entity13 met with the rebels , miles away in western @entity1 , a fierce battle continued to rage for control of @entity89 , the country 's third - largest city . @entity89 has been under siege for seven weeks by @entity11 loyalists . " let 's face it . this is not a fair fight , " @entity13 asserted . " maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying . " while @entity13 insisted he would not have gone to @entity1 without the backing of the @entity103 , a top @entity101 analyst told @entity2 the senator 's trip would increase the pressure on president @entity29 to step up @entity6 involvement . @entity13 " brings more limelight to the rebels , " said @entity108 , a @entity101 scholar with the @entity109 , a conservative @entity110 think tank . " his visit forces some @entity6 officials to reconsider their assessment of the rebels . " " the fact that @entity13 was able to conduct this meeting shows a modicum of organization ( among the rebels ) and also raises the question : if @entity13 can meet the people for whom we are fighting , why not secretary of state @entity126 ? why not vice president @entity127 ? " if @entity13 returns to @entity129 and demands formal recognition of the rebel government as the legitimate representative of the @entity1 people , it is certain to shift the debate on @entity6 diplomatic posture , @entity108 said . if all opponents of the intervention " have done is sit back comfortably in @entity110 , it will be harder for them to drum up moral authority to back their arguments , " he noted . asked by @entity2 to define the @entity6 end game in @entity1 , @entity13 said he envisions " a departure of @entity11 and the @entity1 people being able to set up a government by themselves , with the assistance primarily of the @entity147 but also the @entity6 . " " @entity1 is much closer to @entity147 , and @entity147 have greater ties to @entity1 and greater interests , " @entity13 noted . the @entity150 has sanctioned military action only to protect civilians . both @entity6 and @entity147 leaders , however , have repeatedly stated that their political goal is the ouster of @entity11 . what would the @entity11 's departure mean ? " it means one of three things , " @entity13 said . " he joins @entity161 in @entity162 or he goes to @entity163 , which is my preference , or he joins @entity166 and @entity167 .

@placeholder takes an unprecedented look at young conservative activist - journalists	@entity0	( @entity0 ) -- imperfect though it is , journalism plays unique and essential roles in our society and in our democracy . journalism serves the public and the public interest in important ways different from any other profession . i believe in journalism guided by sound ethical principles and built on competency , commitment and courage . i have a serious concern with news reporting ( as distinguished from the opinion role of journalism ) that is driven by ideological bias or activist intentions . my concern is with any and all forms of ideology from the left or from the right and with any argument that attempts to justify activism . my concerns are rooted in my strong belief in the ethical principle of independence that can and should guide the practice of serious , substantive journalism . i 'm not arguing for a false sense of " objectivity . " rather , independence is about commitment to professional duty that serves society rather than one 's own beliefs and self - interest . i have n't read @entity47 's commentary , nor have i viewed the " @entity49 " @entity0 documentary . thus , my perspective is framed by my beliefs about journalism , what it does well and what it can do better . journalists have an ethical and professional duty to pursue the truth about significant issues and events and to strive to report that elusive truth as accurately , fairly and fully as possible . journalists gather and process a great deal of information and try to make sense of complex and often contentious issues . they report on the strengths and weaknesses of our economy , our government and our communities . they take us down the block and around the globe to give us an understanding of the good , the bad and the ugly happenings in our lives . journalists take us to battlefields to tell us stories of horror and heroism , and they take us to classrooms to report on success , failure and hope . all this is aspirational , of course . journalists , like all professionals , are inadequate at times . one gives his or her best effort recognizing there are many variables that prevent perfection . i do n't believe that ideological bias is the major problem that erodes quality and corrodes credible journalism . this is much more of a perception problem than a reality . it 's a false premise to suggest that most journalists come from an ideological position that reflects personal belief that creates biased reporting . to categorize journalists as liberal or conservative fails to recognize that many individuals -- including journalists -- have a range of views on issues that move along a spectrum . i know journalists who hold what we traditionally think of as liberal views on certain social issues who , at the same time , also hold what we traditionally think of as conservative views on economic issues . i know journalists who hold liberal views on some social issues -- favoring gay marriage , for instance -- while at the same time holding conservative views on other social issues -- expressing a strong pro-life position on abortion , for instance . i know journalists who personally hold contrasting liberal and conservative views on tax policy and health care reform . most of the journalists i know can not be labeled as liberal or conservative , because they hold a range of views that are at different points on the ideological spectrum . how , for instance , would one categorize a journalist who holds the following beliefs : opposed @entity144 military force in @entity145 but favors it in @entity147 , calls for a much stricter immigration policy with no amnesty , favors the ordination of women as @entity153 priests , opposes all forms of abortion , favors capital punishment ? is that person liberal or conservative ? how can we accurately and fairly characterize journalists as conservative or liberal ? how then could we challenge the journalism they produce as driven by conservative or liberal bias ? furthermore , if a reporter allows his or her personal beliefs to become bias that could undermine reporting , good news organizations have checks and balances that minimize any skewing . therein lies my deep concern with the so - called " guerilla journalists " who are attempting to right wrongs . their starting premise is flawed by a distorted perception of the practice of journalism and by a false characterization of the beliefs of journalists . the " guerilla journalism " mission is further undermined by their use of questionable -- often unethical -- methods to report stories . there are many weak points in the underbelly of @entity144 journalism . we need to attract the best and brightest to the profession . we need journalists who are smart , skilled , committed and courageous . we need journalists who reflect all aspects of diversity in our society , and , yes , that includes ideological diversity . journalism has its flaws . let 's improve the process and the product in the right ways , not by ideological activism . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .	@entity144:American	@entity145:Iraq	@entity147:Afghanistan	@entity212:Steele	@entity226:Right On The Edge	@entity0:CNN	@entity47:Brent Bozell	@entity153:Roman Catholic	@entity49:Right on the Edge

@placeholder needed a wildcard to enter the tournament because his ranking was n't high enough	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- the final game of one of the most memorable matches in @entity5 history , featuring two fan favorites , took on a life of its own . back in 2001 -- in the 16th game of the fifth set -- members of @entity12 's entourage asked for divine intervention as the @entity14 sought to close out the encounter against @entity17 's @entity16 and end years of @entity5 heartache . @entity12 himself asked for help from above , he wanted the same ball when serving , and @entity17 and @entity14 spectators on @entity23 roared encouragement between points to make for a football like atmosphere . @entity12 had lost three previous @entity5 finals and seemed destined to miss out on glory at the @entity30 given he had struggled with a shoulder injury earlier in 2001 and contemplated retirement . his ranking of 125th was n't even high enough to land direct entry into the tournament . @entity5 gave @entity12 a wildcard , however , and he proceeded to work his way through the draw with a little help from @entity5 's famed and all too frequent rain gods . so there he was against @entity16 on " people 's monday , " leading 8 - 7 in the fifth set , four points from winning the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world . no ordinary player -- and character -- one sensed that if @entity12 held serve , he would do it the hard way . he had to overcome a resilient @entity16 -- and painful memories of defeats to @entity53 , twice , and @entity54 . it proved to be the case . a forehand volley went long by a large margin for 0 - 15 . at 15 - all , he double faulted . having hit an ace to get to championship point , he subsequently double faulted again -- by a yard . a second championship point came and went with another double fault , this time into the net , and a third was saved by @entity16 with a lob that was good enough against an @entity12 too frozen to jump . @entity16 finally buckled on a fourth match point , the pressure from @entity12 's destructive serve finally too much to repel . a return sailed into the net and @entity12 was the @entity5 champion and the only wildcard to bag the men 's title at noted postcode @entity74 . dedication to a fallen friend he worked his way into his players ' box and exchanged hugs with his team , which included father @entity82 , who had recently undergone a triple heart bypass . @entity12 dedicated the victory to former @entity86 star @entity85 , who died in a car accident in 1993 . " the best moment is when you hold the trophy , " @entity12 told @entity0 's @entity88 before the start of @entity5 . this year 's men 's final will be played on sunday . " i was watching too many guys holding that beautiful trophy . i had this ( runner - up ) plate at home , " added @entity12 . " it 's a nice plate but you do n't want to have that plate at home . " nobody cares for second place . if you want to go back now and think of @entity5 finalists in the past 15 years , to be honest , i have no idea . " @entity12 almost did n't get that far . he trailed @entity112 's @entity111 two sets to one in the semifinals , losing the third 6 - 0 in about 15 minutes . he was out of sorts . that 's when the unpredictable @entity112 weather saved @entity12 and hurt the local darling . with @entity111 holding a 2 - 1 advantage in the fourth set on the second friday of the fortnight , rain fell and the contest was suspended . they returned saturday and @entity12 , mentally fresher , claimed the fourth set in a tiebreak . a further suspension ensured the nervy affair had to be completed sunday , with @entity12 eliminating @entity111 6 - 3 in the fifth to disappoint a nation . a monday final beckoned against @entity16 , himself a loser to @entity53 -- the king of @entity5 prior to @entity134 's arrival -- in the 2000 finale . fans queued up overnight to land one of the 10,000 unreserved tickets made available for the final , leading to a more vocal climax than usual . " it was good that it was on a monday because three finals i lost on sunday , so finally i played on monday , " @entity12 said . " unbelievable atmosphere , probably never again because now they have a roof . " @entity16 is a very good friend , a great guy . we both should have won @entity5 before , him in 2000 in the final , and i was supposed to win a long time ago . " after @entity12 beat @entity149 in the second round he sensed something special was about to happen . did it the hard way besides @entity111 and @entity16 , @entity12 also topped @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 in a difficult draw . of his seven victims , only one -- first - round opponent @entity158 -- would never feature in the top four in the rankings . " it was an unsolved mystery how i won , but i felt after the second round that i was going to win , " @entity12 said . " i could not say it loud because they would think i was completely nuts . " i felt for the first time after so many months , actually a year , the racket ( that i played with had a special sound ) . i lost the sound for a year and a half and that ( first ) monday i got the sound back . i said , ' this is a good sign . ' " the sound had vanished when @entity12 began the year by playing in qualifying at the @entity170 . stuck on a back court after playing in some of the world 's grandest stadiums , he tanked -- a tennis term for not trying . although unpleasant at the time , it proved to be that year 's turning point for @entity12 . " i had a long journey to think about what i was going to do , then i went to play a challenger in @entity180 , " @entity12 said . " i played the final . then i started to play better . i did n't have great results but i started to enjoy it again . " @entity5 came and it was actually my time , " added @entity12 , who can still be seen on the seniors ' tour , while he also helps run a tournament in @entity187 and dabbles in commentating . " it was written somewhere that it was my time . i did everything in my life the harder way . why do it easy if you can do it the hard way ? " but by doing it the hard way , the larger - than - life @entity12 has ensured his achievement at @entity5 will never be forgotten .	@entity23:Centre Court	@entity111:Henman	@entity16:Patrick Rafter	@entity82:Srdjan	@entity158:Fredrik Jonsson	@entity85:Drazen Petrovic	@entity86:NBA	@entity88:Open Court	@entity134:Roger Federer	@entity156:Marat Safin	@entity155:Greg Rusedski	@entity154:Andy Roddick	@entity170:Australian Open	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Wimbledon	@entity53:Sampras	@entity54:Andre Agassi	@entity74:SW19	@entity17:Australian	@entity30:All England Club	@entity14:Croatian	@entity12:Ivanisevic	@entity180:Germany	@entity149:Carlos Moya	@entity187:Zagreb	@entity112:British

a minority in @entity7 , some @placeholder have sided with @entity51	@entity11	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 authorities have learned more about two @entity0 - area men claiming in a video to be gang members fighting in @entity7 : it turns out they are @entity7 nationals of @entity11 descent who were deported back to that country because of their criminal history . one of the men is @entity15 , whom @entity16 deported to @entity7 in 2012 , according to local and federal records provided by sgt. @entity18 of the @entity19 . the spelling of that name in the police records is different from a @entity23 that a @entity25 news research group found on his @entity27 page , but phonetically , it is similar . the other man in the video is @entity32 , who was deported to @entity7 in 2010 , @entity18 said thursday . in the video , @entity32 identifies himself only as " creeper " of the @entity36 - 13 gang and leaves the false impression that he 's a @entity38 gang member because he sprinkles @entity40 words in his fluent @entity41 . @entity18 said @entity32 is a member of the @entity43 gang from @entity44 . their @entity46 video showed them firing rifles in @entity7 's civil war , apparently fighting on behalf of president @entity51 's regime . some @entity11 side with @entity51 because he has protected the minority group in @entity7 . never do the two men face return fire in the video , however . in the profanity - laced video , the two men fire rifles from behind a cinder - block wall at " enemigos " -- enemies -- though the camera never shows an enemy in the distance . the two men often refer to " gang - banging " and their " homies , " and @entity67 hand gestures and tattoos . the video was publicized this week by the @entity71 , a @entity72 - based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social - media postings . " this is very unique because these guys are over there , and they are with the pro-syria forces and pro-hezbollah forces , " said @entity75 , executive director of the institute .

leaders of pro-hillary @entity12 groups are meeting in @placeholder on friday	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the former secretary of state 's most ardent supporters and organizers will meet friday in @entity5 to discuss what now looks like an all - but - certain @entity8 campaign for president . ready for @entity8 , a @entity10 that has been organizing around a @entity12 run for almost two years , is hosting an all - day strategy session that will bring together the different groups that have been working around a @entity12 run since shortly after she left the @entity17 in early 2013 . the @entity19 meeting -- which is being held at the @entity21 in @entity5 -- is part rally , part history lesson for the @entity12 supporters and will bring together top flight @entity26 strategists , longtime @entity12 supporters and at least three people rumored to be the former secretary of state 's next campaign manager . @entity32 , the executive director of the @entity33 ; @entity34 , the president of @entity36 ; and @entity37 , a political operative who worked for @entity12 in 2008 , have all been rumored as likely picks for @entity12 's top campaign job . all three will sit on panels and discuss @entity12 's future friday . ready for @entity8 has been the most high profile pro-clinton super pac that sprung up to boost @entity12 between her years at the @entity17 and her eventual presidential run . founded in 2013 , the group has been focused on garnering grassroots support , building a sizable list of supporters and raising money . the organization has worked somewhat like a ground and grassroots operations for @entity12 , dispatching volunteers to different events and sending a campaign bus to drive across the country and rally support . @entity59 has also started to grease the wheels of state and local politics . the group has sold or traded its email list with over 30 state parties and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to state parties and local campaigns . but friday 's meeting -- and an eventual @entity12 announcement - are somewhat of a going away party for @entity59 and its young , excited staffers . multiple sources from the group told @entity1 that while @entity59 will keep working until @entity12 announces her candidacy , the group will wind down operations that day the former first lady announces . " that is the point at which we would wind down because we are not going to have a separate and competing field and grass roots infrastructure across the country , " said one source with knowledge of @entity59 's plans . " rather than continuing our efforts across the country , we would tell our supporters , ' @entity8 has a campaign , go join it . ' " the day @entity12 announces , the group will also make their supporter list available to the @entity12 campaign , allowing their operation to reach out and activate the supporters ready for @entity8 have cultivated across the country . as @entity59 prepares to fade away , two other super pacs boosting @entity12 are starting to ramp up . priorities @entity95 , the super pac tasked with big money fundraising and ad buying , is in a place to step up the moment that @entity12 declares her run . although the group promised not to raise money for @entity12 while other groups competed for donations around the 2014 midterms , organizers from priorities have been meeting with big @entity26 donors across the country and plan to contact those donors the instant @entity12 announces . the group is currently " sitting down and talking with donors " but not " making direct asks until there is a candidate in place , " said a @entity95 organizer . " i think , once the sort of wheels are in motion , we will go back to the folks that we are meeting with and then there will be solid fundraising off that , " the source said . " once things really start to ramp up , that is when we get the checks in the door .

far cry from 1979 when @entity8 exiles played in camps in @placeholder during @entity31 invasion	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- from playing bat and ball in quiet corners of refugee camps to cricket 's most glamorous tournament ; @entity8 's national team , like the country , has come a long way . the team 's rise to the biggest stage of them all , the @entity11 , has been nothing short of remarkable -- and equally heartwarming . the scenes of jubilation on the pitch as @entity8 recently brushed aside a disappointing @entity20 team could n't have been farther from the reality of life for many @entity8 after decades of conflict and turmoil in their country . the first @entity8 learned the game in @entity29 refugee camps , having fled the @entity31 invasion of 1979 . read more : @entity8 cricket 's battle for acceptance @entity36 was banned completely under the strict @entity38 fundamentalist rule of the @entity39 , between 1996 and 2001 , with pitches and arenas more likely to host an execution than a training session or a match . but as the @entity39 lost its grip , sport blossomed , with cricket among those leading the way . cut strips appeared across the country and children would use roads as wickets , discarded pieces of wood as bats and wickets . and the rest , as they say , is history . @entity8 cricket has gone from strength to strength . just 12 years ago , the team did n't even officially exist . then a few @entity8 expats set up a team in @entity29 and applied for accreditation to global cricket 's organizing body , the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) . in 2001 , @entity8 became an @entity71 associate member , which meant cricket was recognized as an established sport in the country . it was a start , but little more than that . in 2008 , the team played its first matches in division five of the @entity71 's global league -- against @entity82 and the tiny island of @entity84 , a self - governing @entity85 off the coast of northern @entity87 . that 's as low as world cricket goes . but by winning the league , the players gave themselves a chance of qualifying for the @entity93 . ultimately that proved to be a step too far , too soon , as they came up short . but it was n't all bad news . the team did enough in the qualifiers to be granted the status of an international one - day team . they went on to qualify for the world @entity104 , a shortened form of the game , in 2010 and again in 2012 . despite some respectable performances , they did little to surprise the bookies and fell during the initial knock - out stage . but now , what appeared to be nothing more than a dream just a few short years ago has finally become reality . @entity8 triumphed over @entity20 by seven wickets at the recent @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 to win the right to play at the @entity11 . they will be part of a group that includes co-hosts @entity124 and @entity126 , as well as @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 .

guests at the @placeholder help make electricity by using the hotel 's stationary bikes	@entity123	( @entity0 ) -- airport hotels have always been necessary but unloved stopover spots for the depleted traveler , places to shower , rehydrate and let the body recuperate from the merciless rigors of flying . yet checking into the @entity7 , which opened in december turned out to be much more . it 's an example of the emerging generation of airport hotels that are intended to function as destinations , real places where one might reasonably stay longer than a single night . some of the best and most spectacular airport hotels are in @entity14 : the @entity15 in @entity16 ; the @entity17 in @entity18 . now the rest of the world is catching up , and the newest airport hotels in @entity22 , the @entity23 , @entity24 , and elsewhere are responding to the generalized craving for experience . and there 's more going on than that : the increasing sophistication of these hotels parallels a reemergence of civilization ‚Äî daring architecture ; edible food ‚Äî in airports themselves . @entity37 : innovative new airport terminals the improved hotels are one component of a backlash against that shiny one - world placelessness that airports have long cultivated . moreover , they are being retooled for a new breed of business traveler . " the nature of work is changing , " says @entity47 , head of design for the @entity50 and @entity51 brands , " and it 's very collaborative . " now airport hotels ‚Äî like the newly opened @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 in @entity62 ‚Äî are catching up , bringing technology , design , and style to the international stopover . @entity56 @entity7 the @entity7 is a stylish , hyper - connected oasis . the hotel , along with the lower - priced @entity68 , occupies the eastern end of the @entity70 ( a name meant to evoke town square and air ) , an ultra-elongated mixed - use complex that rests on angled columns atop a high - speed rail station , is adjacent to the airport 's commuter train station , and is squeezed between two major autobahns . when @entity70 managing director @entity81 characterizes it as " the best - connected spot in @entity22 , " he 's not exaggerating . @entity37 : @entity24 's safest airports @entity85 ( @entity86 ) a series of glass modules lined up like the teeth of a comb , this property makes for a fitting addition to a world capital of design . @entity95 two minutes from the terminal via @entity98 , the building is leed certified and has a lobby floor made of terrazzo embedded with glass . @entity102 a newly rehabbed @entity104 building ‚Äî dropped ceilings have been removed to give the rooms at this hotel an airy feel , and an expanded lobby big enough for a bustling bar scene has been added . @entity37 : @entity24 's best and worst airports @entity112 , @entity113 from its glamorous all - white main lobby staircase and unusually glitzy light fixtures to perfectly manicured exterior grounds and a celebrity chef -- helmed restaurant ( mr. @entity120 ) , this property has all the makings of a hotel hot spot . @entity123 the @entity62 satellite of this @entity51 brand features the cutting - edge pilot program , where electricity can be generated by guests using the hotel 's stationary bikes . the fully equipped kitchens , nutritious menus , and bathrooms with mood - improving lighting attest to @entity61 's health - conscious hospitality approach . @entity137 , @entity138 original art , @entity142 cotton linens , an @entity145 - made @entity144 chair , and @entity146 bath products lend sophisticated global flair to the 153 - room @entity148 , part of @entity151 hotel group @entity150 . @entity152 , @entity153 relaunched and refreshed by @entity165 in september 2011 , this bombastic crash pad minutes from @entity156 appeals to your sense of whimsy with themed gimmicks , like the @entity161 -- inspired staff uniforms and @entity163 , the property 's main lobby . @entity166 when @entity166 's long - awaited @entity167 opens in march 2013 , so too will this grand 322 - room property with an outdoor reflecting pool , nine meeting spaces , a lobby bistro , and a fitness center with a gym , sauna , and steam bath . @entity176 , @entity177 understated and refined , this hotel provides a welcome break from its chaotic surroundings ‚Äî a massive theme - park - mall complex within the airport . it opened in late 2011 , with touch screen controls in the 197 rooms . planning a getaway ? do n't miss @entity37 's guide to the @entity189 's @entity188 copyright 2012 @entity190 . all rights reserved .	@entity22:Europe	@entity23:United States	@entity24:America	@entity144:Calla	@entity81:Christoph Nebl	@entity113:U.K.	@entity85:Sheraton Malpensa Hotel	@entity86:Milan	@entity153:Los Angeles	@entity152:Custom Hotel	@entity137:ALT Hotel Pearson	@entity150:Groupe Germain	@entity156:LAX	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Hilton Frankfurt Airport	@entity177:South Korea	@entity176:Lotte City Hotel Gimpo Airport	@entity197:ALT Hotel Pearson	@entity190:American Express Publishing Corporation	@entity51:Westin	@entity50:Sheraton	@entity57:London	@entity56:Hilton	@entity59:Auckland	@entity58:Novotel	@entity70:Squaire	@entity17:Crowne Plaza	@entity16:Hong Kong	@entity15:Regal	@entity14:Asia	@entity37:Travel + Leisure	@entity189:World	@entity142:Egyptian	@entity18:Singapore	@entity102:Aloft San Francisco International Airport	@entity104:Clarion Inn	@entity98:SkyTrain	@entity95:Atlanta Airport Marriott Gateway	@entity123:Element Miami	@entity120:Todiwala 's Kitchen	@entity188:Best Hotels	@entity163:Hangar Lounge	@entity146:Fruits & Passion	@entity161:Pan Am	@entity166:Berlin	@entity167:Brandenburg Airport	@entity151:Canadian	@entity165:Joie de Vivre	@entity148:ALT	@entity145:Italian	@entity47:Erin Hoover	@entity138:Toronto	@entity68:Hilton Garden Inn	@entity61:Element	@entity62:Miami International Airport	@entity60:New Zealand	@entity112:Hilton Heathrow Terminal 5
he says @placeholder 's 450 million active users make it attractive in terms of growth	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- one of this week 's most astounding stories is @entity3 's acquisition of @entity4 , a mobile messaging service that has more than 450 million monthly active users globally . the $ 19 billion that @entity3 will spend on buying @entity4 created a collective jaw - drop in the tech world . sure , the price tag is getting a lot of buzz -- $ 19 billion is a historically big number for a venture funded company . but what exactly is @entity3 getting out of it ? a company just a few years old with less than a billion dollars in revenue and a service that is nearly ( but not quite ) free . is all of that worth so much money ? just as with the acquisition of @entity23 by @entity24 for $ 1.65 billion or @entity3 's purchase of @entity26 for $ 1 billion , many people simply have a hard time wrapping their mind around an acquisition of a service that does n't fit with traditional valuation principles . in the old world , company valuations were based on a multiple of revenue or free cash flow , while also factoring growth over time . but in the new world of @entity39 and social media , revenue is often something that will come later as the result of hyper growth , and traditional valuation techniques do n't apply . still , because of the eye - popping price , many are naturally asking if this acquisition is a sign of a tech bubble . after all , prices for social media and internet service startups seem to be getting bigger by the day and , well , $ 19 billion is a mind - blowing number . to which i would say that while the price seems enormous - mainly because it is - the price per user is actually in line with acquisitions in the past decade . when looking at price - per - user from acquisitions over the past decade and throwing out outliers like @entity66 's acquisition of @entity67 for nearly $ 11,000 per user ( nice job , @entity69 ) , what @entity3 paid for each @entity4 user is solidly in the middle of the pack at $ 42 , above @entity26 's $ 28 cost per user and @entity78 's $ 33 per user , but below the $ 48 or so @entity24 paid for each @entity23 user back in 2006 . so while other acquisitions have been much cheaper in total price paid by @entity3 , that 's because the total user base of these other services has been much lower . and that 's the thing that makes @entity4 such an attractive prize for @entity3 : 450 million active users . not only is that a massive number , but the number is also growing very quickly , having doubled in just the past year . in short , with this acquisition , @entity3 is getting the most popular mobile social messaging app in the whole world . the importance of this ca n't be understated . @entity3 has been trying over the past few years to adapt to the mobile world with mixed results , and now with @entity4 , @entity96 is not only getting a massively popular mobile social messaging service , but one that is also enormously popular in emerging markets . as others have aptly noted , because @entity3 does n't control a mobile platform itself ( unlike @entity24 with @entity101 ) , and with its stock rising , @entity96 likely felt it had to make this move now to add fuel to its transition to the world of mobile computing . if @entity3 did n't make this move , @entity24 , which reportedly offered $ 10 billlion for @entity4 , likely would have . @entity3 is showing that it is willing to bet big chunks of the company ( the @entity4 acquisition will cost them roughly 10 % of outstanding @entity3 shares ) to disrupt themselves and remain relevant . a high price to be sure , but judging by recent history , the price it paid is about right . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .	@entity3:Facebook	@entity23:YouTube	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:Instagram	@entity24:Google	@entity4:WhatsApp	@entity39:Internet	@entity101:Android	@entity78:Tumblr	@entity69:Mark Cuban	@entity66:Yahoo	@entity67:Broadcast.com	@entity96:Zuckerberg	@entity119:Wolf
@entity220 : it was easier for the @placeholder to kill @entity3 than to kill his ideology	@entity55	( @entity0 ) -- killing the man proved easier than killing his ideology . following a decade - long hunt , @entity3 was finally run to ground in @entity5 two years ago . @entity3 did not die on the bloody battlefield of a holy war but in a suburban compound in the comfortable city of @entity10 in northern @entity5 , surrounded by three of his wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren . the anti-heroic death of the @entity19 leader was greeted by only small protests in the @entity22 world . and worries that @entity3 's " martyrdom " would unleash a new wave of terrorist attacks have proved unfounded . at the time of @entity3 's death on may 1 , 2011 , core @entity19 had already been severely degraded by @entity31 drone strikes . drones have killed at least 30 leaders of @entity19 in @entity5 , according to a count by the @entity35 . some of the most senior @entity19 leaders had also been arrested in @entity5 . as @entity39 , who headed @entity31 operations against @entity19 in the years after 9/11 , puts it in the @entity42 documentary " @entity43 " : " congratulations , @entity45 , you 're now the no. 3 in @entity19 ; that 's the good news . the bad news is , you 're now the no. 3 in @entity19 . get ready . buckle your chinstrap , because your career path is probably going to be short - lived . " as a result of @entity31 operations , the @entity19 core is now on life support . simultaneously , @entity3 's overall strategy has failed . instead of forcing the @entity55 to pull out of the @entity56 as @entity3 had predicted would happen after the 9/11 attacks , the @entity55 , together with its allies , largely destroyed @entity19 in @entity60 and later invaded @entity61 while building up massive @entity55 military bases in @entity22 countries such as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 . @entity67 : agencies often miss warning signs of attacks if @entity3 's strategy of attacking the @entity55 was a failure , his ideas , unfortunately , may have more lasting currency , at least among a small minority in the @entity22 world . like many of history 's most effective leaders , @entity3 told a simple story about the world that his followers around the globe found easy to grasp . in his telling , there was a conspiracy by the @entity87 and its puppet allies in the @entity22 world to destroy true @entity89 , a conspiracy led by the @entity55 . as a result of this purported conspiracy , violence against the @entity55 was a necessity . @entity3 's single narrative of a war on @entity89 by the @entity87 also purports to explain all the problems of the @entity22 world : for example , that the long - running war between @entity99 and the @entity100 is not a centuries - old imperialist land grab by the @entity99 but is rather a @entity104 war against @entity89 . so , too , are the @entity55 - led wars in @entity60 and @entity61 , which @entity106 has told investigators were among the reasons he and his brother carried out the bombings that targeted the @entity111 , according to a @entity55 government official who briefed @entity0 . @entity19 , the organization that @entity3 created during the late 1980s , has now morphed into a loose jihadist ideological movement . that movement spawned the most spectacular terrorist attacks in the @entity55 since 9/11 in the form of the @entity106 brothers , who authorities said killed four and injured some 250 others during the course of a five - day killing spree in @entity122 this month . this is @entity3 's most toxic legacy : " @entity124 . " it is an ideological movement that is supported by an entire jihadist ecosystem in which the @entity106 brothers and other militants can easily swim . @entity67 : who really killed @entity3 ? the widely available @entity131 webzine inspire is produced by @entity19 's @entity133 affiliate and teaches recruits in the @entity87 how to build bombs . password - protected jihadist forums allow militants to " meet " electronically and clandestinely . @entity139 clerics preach hate in colloquial @entity131 on the @entity141 , and shadowy overseas militant groups allied to @entity19 or influenced by its ideology have recruited and trained many thousands of militants during the past decade , including dozens of @entity55 . the most effective of these militant groups today is the @entity145 in @entity146 , which is essentially a rebranded franchise of @entity19 's @entity61 affiliate . @entity148 is the most effective force fighting the @entity151 regime and is widely regarded as the most disciplined of the hundreds of opposition groups now fighting in @entity146 . @entity148 seems to have learned from the mistakes of @entity19 in @entity61 , which wantonly killed fellow @entity22 and imposed @entity155 - style rule on @entity61 's @entity157 population , provoking a tribal rebellion against @entity19 known as the @entity159 that began in 2006 and devastated @entity19 in @entity61 . @entity148 is avoiding these kinds of mistakes and is actually providing services in a systematic way to the populated area it controls , something of a first for an @entity19 affiliate . @entity148 makes large quantities of much - needed bread for the desperate @entity146 population and even controls some of @entity146 's oil fields . in the documents that were picked up by the @entity174 seal team that raided @entity3 's compound in @entity10 are many examples of @entity3 and other @entity19 leaders urging fellow militants to avoid causing @entity22 civilian casualties and to learn from the mistakes of @entity19 in @entity61 . in @entity146 , these lessons , for the moment , seem to be being heeded , while the tragedy in @entity122 shows that the death of @entity3 did not lead to the death of his ideas . @entity67 : should we still fear @entity19 ? this is underlined by a poll conducted by the @entity190 in spring 2012 , a year after @entity3 was killed , finding that in @entity5 , 13 % of @entity22 held a favorable view of @entity19 . in @entity192 , 15 % expressed a positive opinion , and the group received its highest ratings in @entity196 , where 21 % held a favorable view . these favorable numbers are , of course , far outweighed by the unfavorable views that @entity19 enjoys in the same countries . for most @entity22 , whatever fleeting attraction @entity19 's ideology may once have enjoyed has largely evaporated , in particular because @entity19 and it allies have killed so many @entity22 civilians around the @entity89 world . but @entity124 continues to excite a small but not insignificant minority of @entity22 . we will be living with this ideology for many years to come until it is finally consigned to " history 's unmarked grave of discarded lies , " as president @entity215 eloquently put it in a speech to @entity218 10 days after 9/11 .	@entity22:Muslims	@entity99:Russians	@entity159:Sunni Awakening	@entity139:Firebrand	@entity111:Boston Marathon	@entity87:West	@entity89:Islamic	@entity151:Bashar al-Assad	@entity157:Sunni	@entity133:Yemeni	@entity3:bin Laden	@entity215:George W.

@placeholder day care center is pursuing federal civil rights lawsuit against club	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 day care center is pursuing a federal civil rights lawsuit against a swim club that canceled the center 's membership , the day care director and attorney told @entity0 's " @entity9 " on wednesday . some kids from the @entity11 say white members of a swim club made racial remarks . " specifically , the lawsuit will be based on violations of @entity18 of the @entity19 which relates to the denial of access and use and advantages of a public accommodation , " attorney @entity15 said . " the humiliation , embarrassment , and the scarring and suffering of the children -- that would be covered by our claim for compensatory damages . " @entity33 said the center -- attended by many minority children -- is also seeking " punitive damages to punish the club for the harm that they 've done to the children . " the dispute started after the @entity42 , in @entity43 , @entity2 , revoked the swimming privileges of about 65 children from the largely minority @entity11 day care center after one visit on june 29 . some black and @entity49 children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit , asking why " black children were there " and raising concerns that " they might steal from us . " the day care center had originally contracted to use the pool during the summer , but the club canceled the agreement and returned the day care center 's $ 1,950 check without explanation . the club canceled contracts with two other day care centers because of safety and crowding , swim club director @entity64 said . those two other centers have not protested the club 's actions . the issue was exacerbated when @entity64 told two @entity74 television stations the children had changed " the complexion " and " atmosphere " of the club . the comment brought protesters outside the facility . @entity64 later said that safety and crowding -- not racism -- prompted the cancellation . as the controversy grew and reached national news shows , the swim club asked the @entity11 day care to return . it refused and said it would pursue a lawsuit . @entity11 director @entity91 told @entity0 that the club did not reach out directly to her facility to invite them back to the pool . " my attorneys have not received any written invitation for us to come back , " @entity33 said wednesday . " the only thing that i 've heard has been third party via the media . " she said she offered to come to a resolution but she said @entity64 told her following a meeting of the club 's board , " ' let the chips fall where they may . ' " @entity33 said the situation has adversely affected the children . " the children are not doing well at all ... it 's really coming to the surface how these children have been affected , " she said . " they 're asking questions [ like ] are they too dark to go into the pool ? " watch what children allege club members said to them ¬ª the swim club has been subpoenaed by @entity2 's @entity122 , which has begun a fact - finding investigation , said the wife of the club 's director , @entity125 . she told @entity0 on tuesday night that the club " could not handle a lawsuit .

" i hope we can teach our children a lesson -- that you should admit errors . we should have done things differently . and if there are differences , we can overcome them .

animal is now known to live only in the @placeholder	@entity16	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- rare images of an @entity5 animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released . one of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap . the okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe , with zebra - like stripes on its rear . it is native to the tropical rainforests of @entity5 but is now known to live only in the @entity16 . @entity17 were last seen in the @entity16 50 years ago , and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild . " to have captured the first - ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing , " said @entity21 , manager of the @entity22 at the @entity23 , which took the pictures . " okapi are very shy and rare animals , which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence . " the okapi 's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe , their closest - living relative , but they look more like horses with long necks . the average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters ( 5 feet , 3 inches ) , the @entity23 says . they have a short , dense , velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears . the new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the @entity16 's @entity52 , where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife . in one image , an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover . its large ears , dark nose , and zebra stripes are clearly visible . the next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera , giving a clear view of its striking black - and - white stripes on its rear legs . a third image released by @entity23 was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal . " the photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear , which act like unique fingerprints , " said @entity74 , a key member of @entity23 's survey team in the @entity16 . " we have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts . " @entity23 said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival , which include poaching , deforestation , military camps inside the park , and the influx of refugees at the park 's borders . the animal 's exact status is still a mystery , however , and it remains under threat , the @entity23 said . okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of @entity109 -- and if hunting continues at the same rate , okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years , the @entity23 said . the @entity52 is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit , the @entity23 said . the @entity23 's study of the okapi is part of a larger @entity121 - funded conservation project in the park . though focused on okapi , the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers , a kind of antelope , a @entity23 spokeswoman said . the study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the @entity23 and the @entity133 , the spokeswoman said . the announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously - unknown gorillas in the neighboring @entity138 . the @entity140 - based @entity139 said in august they had found 125,000 @entity142 lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern @entity16 , adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species . @entity17 were well known by @entity5 for centuries but the animal remained elusive , thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage , according to @entity151 . @entity154 - century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi 's striped backside as it ran through the forest , leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra , the @entity152 says . it was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal . still , the okapi remained unknown to the western world until the early 20th century , when @entity167 explorer @entity165 went to @entity16 and sent a complete skin and skull back to @entity167 , the @entity23 said .	@entity22:Bushmeat and Forests Conservation Program	@entity23:ZSL	@entity21:Noelle Kumpel	@entity139:Wildlife Conservation Society	@entity138:Republic of Congo	@entity152:National Zoological Gardens	@entity151:The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa	@entity133:Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation	@entity154:Nineteenth	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:LONDON	@entity0:England	@entity5:African	@entity52:Virunga National Park	@entity74:Theirry Lusenge	@entity17:Okapi	@entity16:Democratic Republic of the Congo	@entity109:Beni	@entity121:EU	@entity140:U.S.	@entity167:Britain	@entity142:Western	@entity165:Harry Johnston
@entity5 forces launched raids in @entity21 and @placeholder over the weekend	@entity172	( @entity0 ) -- two secret blitzes . two high - value targets . two very different results . @entity5 forces launched dual raids on the northern and eastern coasts of @entity8 over the weekend in the hunt for two alleged terrorists : @entity11 , a suspected @entity13 operative wanted for the deadly 1998 bombings of two @entity5 embassies in @entity8 , and an @entity17 foreign fighter commander named @entity18 . @entity5 forces snatched @entity11 in the @entity21 capital saturday morning . but 3,000 miles away , the plan to catch @entity18 did n't go as planned . @entity23 came under heavy fire during their raid and had to retreat -- not knowing whether @entity18 was dead or alive . while officials have disclosed some details , many questions remain . here are the five key ones : 1 . what 's next for @entity11 ? he spent 15 years on the run and had a $ 5 million reward on his head . but he was captured in less than a minute by @entity36 @entity35 members outside his home in @entity39 . the @entity40 said the @entity5 military was holding @entity11 in a " secure location " outside @entity21 . there , a team of officials from the @entity45 , the @entity46 and other intelligence agencies will grill him for intelligence on @entity13 . eventually , he 'll be taken to @entity50 to face federal charges . @entity5 authorities have long wanted @entity11 to stand trial in an @entity5 court for his alleged role in the embassy bombings in @entity57 and @entity58 that left over 200 dead and thousands wounded . in december 2010 , @entity21 authorities told a @entity62 committee that @entity11 was living there , even giving a @entity39 address for him . but @entity11 had n't been apprehended until now because of the delicate security situation in much of @entity21 , where ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the @entity67 -- held considerable sway since the ultimate ouster of longtime leader @entity70 . there 's no extradition treaty between @entity21 and the @entity5 . and @entity21 's interim government has called @entity11 's capture a " kidnapping . " @entity5 secretary of state @entity76 disputes that . he described @entity11 as a key @entity13 figure who is a " legal and an appropriate target . " @entity76 said monday that @entity11 " will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be appropriately brought to justice in a court of law . " ruthless leader aims to extend reach of @entity17 , eyes the @entity88 2 . could @entity11 be a treasure trove of information ? that 's the hope , but it might not happen . @entity93 , who lost her father and brother in the embassy attack in @entity97 , said she was relieved when @entity98 -- also indicted in the embassy attacks -- was killed in 2011 . but she 's also happy that @entity100 is in @entity5 hands . " certainly , we are very pleased to know that we can have someone who is captured , and for the wealth of information that may be available to our intelligence community and our military personnel , " she said . " you ca n't put a price on that . " if he talks , @entity100 could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside @entity21 , as well as @entity13 in general . " he is a big catch . he is going to know about the @entity21 branch of @entity13 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity114 said . " he knows the entire infrastructure of the early days of @entity98 . catching this guy alive , he 's got a lot to say , a lot -- carrying a lot of phone numbers , all sorts of knowledge . " but some think @entity11 probably does n't know much about the current operational details of @entity13 . " there 's a lot of thought out there that @entity11 may have sort of gone into semi-retirement , " @entity0 @entity40 correspondent @entity127 said . " maybe he was in @entity21 , of course , to start an @entity13 operation there , but had sort of moved away over the last 15 years from some of his potential activities . " @entity21 counterterrorism analyst @entity137 , a former jihadist associate of @entity100 's , also said his former colleague has been out of the game for a while . @entity142 's wife agreed , saying he was living a normal life and was not in hiding . she said he actually reapplied for a job with the oil ministry . @entity146 said her husband left @entity13 in 1996 and had no connection to the twin 1998 bombings at @entity5 embassies in @entity57 and @entity58 . " i am sure of what i am saying -- he did not take part in any bombing anywhere in the world , " @entity151 told @entity0 's @entity152 . " he participated in the jihad in @entity159 . ... . he was a member of @entity13 and he was personal security for @entity98 -- that 's true -- but he did not take part in any operation . " opinion : good thing @entity5 terrorist hunters were n't furloughed 3 . who is @entity168 ? the target of the @entity5 raid in @entity172 was named @entity168 -- a @entity57 of @entity172 origin , a senior administration official told @entity0 . he has been on the @entity5 radar for at least three years . before dawn saturday , a team of @entity23 zoomed in by speedboat and snuck up on a seaside villa in southern @entity172 . soon afterward , the sounds of heavy gunfire and several large explosions echoed across the port city of @entity183 . after coming under fire , the @entity23 made a " prudent decision " to pull back , a senior @entity5 official said . they withdrew , unable to confirm whether they killed their target , the official said . a recent @entity57 intelligence report alleged that @entity18 was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in @entity57 between 2011 and 2013 . the most recent was a plot to attack @entity194 in @entity57 's @entity195 in april . @entity57 officials said last year that @entity18 had a significant role in recruiting and training @entity57 in @entity17 . he is thought to have been a close associate of the @entity201 , a fellow @entity57 and senior @entity13 operative in east @entity8 , who was believed to have been connected to the embassy attacks . ( @entity201 was killed by @entity5 forces in 2009 in @entity172 . ) @entity18 also appears to be close to @entity17 leader @entity204 , who also goes by @entity205 . @entity17 , of course , is the @entity13 - linked militant group based in @entity172 . most recently , it made headlines when it claimed responsibility for the days - long deadly attack at @entity57 's upscale @entity210 in @entity97 in september . at least 67 people were killed in that siege . 4 . were the raids a coincidence or were they coordinated ? the two missions have one thing in common : the 1998 embassy bombings . @entity142 was wanted for his alleged role in attacks . and @entity18 is closely associated with @entity220 , also accused of being part of the attacks . but @entity5 officials have not talked specifics about the timing . " sometimes that depends on the moment of opportunity . you can be watching and then the moment of opportunity comes up and you have to take it , " says @entity0 foreign affairs correspondent @entity229 . president @entity233 gave his go - ahead and was updated as the operations proceeded . the missions , however , are unlikely to help buoy @entity233 as he battles @entity237 amidst a partial government shutdown . " i would submit to you right now most @entity5 remain focused on the economy . they remain focused on the government shutdown and the upcoming debt ceiling lifting or not lifting , depending on what @entity245 decides to do , " @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity241 said . but @entity247 of @entity248 said the missions are a reminder that " even an @entity5 president who is domestically very frustrated wields extraordinary executive powers . " @entity5 forces strike in @entity21 , @entity172 5 . who is next ? the operatives of the 9/11 era are largely dead or captured . and key operatives like @entity258 -- an alleged 9/11 mastermind -- are detained at @entity260 . topping the list of still - wanted is @entity262 , the leader of @entity13 . with a $ 25 million reward on his head , @entity262 is believed to be hiding in @entity265 . but some of the biggest targets are part of the new @entity13 affiliates like @entity17 -- including its top leader , @entity205 . " by formally merging with @entity13 and doing an attack in which @entity5 were targeted , this group has put itself in the sights of the @entity5 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity271 said . the @entity5 is also hunting for other emerging terrorist leaders . @entity276 is a one - time @entity98 aide and leader of @entity278 ( @entity278 ) . the @entity280 - based group is now considered one of the most lethal . @entity0 's @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity127 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Navy SEALs	@entity21:Libya	@entity276:Nasser al-Wuhayshi	@entity258:Khalid Sheikh Mohammed	@entity159:Afghanistan	@entity114:Bob Baer	@entity278:AQAP	@entity88:West	@entity152:Jomana Karadsheh	@entity137:Noman Benotman	@entity151:Rahman	@entity271:Peter Bergen	@entity97:Nairobi	@entity233:Obama	@entity0:CNN	@entity210:Westgate mall	@entity237:House Republicans	@entity5:U.S.	@entity45:FBI	@entity195:North Eastern Province	@entity8:Africa	@entity50:New York	@entity57:Kenya	@entity194:Mandera Airport	@entity76:Kerry	@entity70:Moammar Gadhafi	@entity17:Al-Shabaab	@entity13:al Qaeda	@entity35:Delta Force	@entity11:Abu Anas al Libi	@entity36:U.S. Army	@entity39:Tripoli	@entity18:Ikrima	@entity247:David Rennie	@entity204:Mukhtar Abu Zubayr	@entity245:Congress	@entity172:Somalia	@entity241:Candy Crowley	@entity98:bin Laden	@entity265:Pakistan	@entity127:Barbara Starr	@entity201:Ali Nabhan	@entity93:Edith Bartley	@entity260:Guantanamo Bay	@entity205:Godane	@entity248:The Economist	@entity100:al Libi	@entity146:Umm Abdul Rahman	@entity58:Tanzania	@entity142:Al Libi	@entity229:Jill Dougherty	@entity262:Zawahiri	@entity183:Barawe	@entity220:Saleh Ali Nabhan	@entity283:Paul Cruickshank	@entity282:Tim Lister	@entity46:CIA	@entity280:Yemen	@entity40:Pentagon	@entity67:Libyan Islamic Fighters Group	@entity62:U.N.	@entity168:Ikrima
world champion outshines new @placeholder teammate @entity47 in @entity6	@entity52	( @entity0 ) -- world champion @entity1 hailed @entity3 's new qualifying format after claiming pole position for sunday 's season - opening race in @entity6 . the @entity7 headed off @entity9 's @entity8 in saturday 's new 15 - minute session , involving just the top 12 riders , while last season 's championship runnerup @entity14 was third to complete the front row . " it 's great to finish in pole position , especially knowing @entity21 was extremely fast over one lap , " @entity1 , who won last year 's race from pole , told the @entity3 website . he said of the new qualifying format : " it 's very different to last year and i think more fun for the fans to watch . " from the point of view of the riders , i feel more nervous and with more pressure on me because you know you have only four attempts for your last lap -- and not 15 like last year ! so it 's more important to go quickly and not make a mistake . " @entity38 's @entity37 was fourth for @entity39 ahead of @entity41 rider @entity40 and @entity43 rookie @entity42 , who had topped the practice times in his first outing for @entity46 . @entity1 's new teammate @entity47 continued his struggles of the past two years at @entity39 as he could only qualify seventh . " qualifying was not fantastic for us , " said the seven - time world champion , who has won three times in @entity6 but not since his last season at @entity52 in 2010 . " our performance in free practice was better than this , so we 'll wait for tomorrow . unfortunately in qualifying , on the second tire -- with which i could have improved -- i was stuck in traffic so could not improve my lap time and lost some positions . " for sure , tomorrow becomes more difficult to start from further back , but we have good pace so we can be quite competitive . " @entity14 is seeking to improve his record at @entity66 -- one of only two circuits on the current calendar where the @entity7 has yet to win in any category of bikes .

new : former @placeholder captain @entity152 accuses @entity8 of hyprocrisy in their appeal to @entity5	@entity124	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the governing body of world football , @entity5 , has turned down the request from the @entity7 ( @entity8 ) to replay their deciding @entity10 play - off game against @entity11 . the controversial match , that was played on wednesday , has caused a diplomatic storm after @entity11 forward @entity14 admitted to illegally using his hand to set - up the goal that gave his team a 2 - 1 aggregate victory to seal qualification to the tournament . but despite a letter sent to @entity5 by the @entity8 , and calls from both the @entity24 prime minister @entity23 and @entity24 justice minister @entity25 for the game to be replayed , the sport 's organizing body has refused the request . in a statement on their official web site @entity5 stated : " the result of the match can not be changed and the match can not be replayed . as is clearly mentioned in the @entity34 , during matches , decisions are taken by the referee and these decisions are final . " @entity24 football officials lodged an official complaint with @entity5 on thursday and sent a letter to the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) in a bid to get the game reconvened . the world 's worst football injustices " the governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay , " @entity8 chief executive @entity45 told reporters . the @entity8 pointed to a precedent set in 2005 when a @entity10 qualifier between @entity54 and @entity55 was replayed after the referee was found to have committed a technical error in the application of the laws of the game . but a @entity5 spokesman said the precedent did not apply because the referee in the match " saw the incident in question and simply failed to apply the proper rules " . @entity24 prime minister @entity23 raised the issue with @entity11 president @entity69 at a @entity71 ( @entity71 ) summit in @entity72 , where the two leaders were meeting to vote for the next president of @entity75 . @entity23 told the @entity77 newspaper : " i did n't ask for a replay . i said , you know : ' what do you think ? ' and he said : ' look , i understand totally the sense of disappointment that you feel about the game . i 'm not trying to mix politics and sport in this respect . we just had a chat . [ but ] it 's not going to be resolved by he and @entity93 " mr @entity69 , however , said he did not want to get involved : " i said to @entity23 , who is a friend of mine as you know , that i was sorry for them and how i was struck by the talent and vigor of the @entity24 team . " now do not ask me to stand in for the referee of the game or the football decision -- be they in @entity11 or in @entity75 , " he said . " what will be done will be done . but leave me out of it , please . and to be perfectly frank with you that is the sort of answer i want to give , " he added . despite @entity69 's comments , @entity11 finance minister @entity110 said she supported moves for a replay . " i think it 's very sad . i 'm of course very happy that the @entity11 team will play in the @entity10 , but i find it very sad that it did qualify with ... you know ... an act of cheating , " she told @entity116 radio station . the game between @entity11 and @entity124 was one of six play offs played on wednesday which decided the final 32 teams heading @entity128 in 2010 . video replays showed @entity14 used his hand to stop the ball going out of play in extra-time , before he passed to @entity134 who booked his nation 's place with a headed goal . the draw for next year 's finals is due to be made in @entity140 on december 4 .	@entity23:Brian Cowen	@entity24:Irish	@entity25:Dermot Ahern	@entity116:RTL	@entity110:Christine Lagarde	@entity134:William Gallas	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:England	@entity0:London	@entity7:Irish Football Association	@entity5:FIFA	@entity8:FAI	@entity55:Bahrain	@entity54:Uzbekistan	@entity75:Europe	@entity77:Irish Independent	@entity71:EU	@entity72:Brussels	@entity14:Henry	@entity34:Laws of the Game	@entity11:French	@entity10:World Cup	@entity152:Roy Keane	@entity128:South Africa	@entity124:Ireland	@entity93:I.	@entity140:Cape Town	@entity45:John Delaney	@entity40:FFF	@entity69:Nicolas Sarkozy
@placeholder face @entity12 on tuesday needing a win to qualify in second place	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- pre-tournament favorites the @entity1 qualified for the quarterfinals of the @entity4 with a 3 - 1 victory against @entity6 in @entity7 on friday night , despite having @entity8 sent off . the elephants have four points from two games , leaving @entity6 and @entity12 to fight for the other place from @entity14 , with @entity15 having withdrawn following the deadly gun attack on their team bus . @entity6 's @entity6 will need to show more penetration next tuesday than they did on a boggy - looking , cut up pitch in @entity21 , with @entity12 needing just a draw to go through . injury - hit @entity6 , four - time winners of the tournament , started with captain @entity25 on the bench as he was deemed not ready to play due to the hamstring problem that delayed his arrival from @entity30 . and while his side made it a bright start , it was the @entity34 who took the lead in the 23rd minute after a swift counter-attack , with @entity39 midfielder @entity38 threading a slide - rule pass behind the defense to @entity42 which allowed the @entity44 striker to square a simple chance for @entity46 to knock into the net . @entity42 's clubmate @entity25 came on at halftime for @entity50 and gave his team more presence in midfield , but it was the @entity1 who were left to rue strongarm tactics when @entity56 's @entity8 was red - carded for a dreadful two - footed lunge on @entity58 in the 55th minute . @entity59 almost made the @entity34 pay immediately , but his left - foot shot hit the base of the post with goalkeeper @entity63 well beaten . but @entity6 paid for their lack of finishing when @entity66 fired in a superb free - kick in the 67th minute , with his dipping left - foot effort from the right - hand side of the pitch clearing the wall and beating keeper @entity72 at his near post . @entity42 was stretchered off soon after following a collision with a teammate , but the @entity1 were comfortable and added a third goal in the final minute of regulation time when his replacement @entity79 did well to deliver a cross which captain @entity81 powerfully headed home at the far post . @entity6 were given a consolation penalty in time added on when halftime substitute @entity86 went down under a 50 - 50 challenge from @entity88 , and the @entity90 striker got up to slot the goal .	@entity21:Cabinda	@entity25:Essien	@entity81:Didier Drogba	@entity86:Asamoah Gyan	@entity88:Soulemane Bamba	@entity34:Ivorians	@entity1:Ivory Coast	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Angola	@entity6:Ghana	@entity4:Africa Cup of Nations	@entity8:Emmanuel Eboue	@entity50:Mousse Narry	@entity79:Kader Keita	@entity56:Arsenal	@entity59:Mathew Amoah	@entity58:Agyeman Opoku	@entity72:Richard Kingson	@entity30:England	@entity15:Togo	@entity14:Group B	@entity12:Burkina Faso	@entity39:Barcelona	@entity38:Yaya Toure	@entity90:Rennes	@entity44:Chelsea	@entity46:Gervinho	@entity42:Kalou	@entity66:Siaka Tiene	@entity63:Boubacar Barry
@entity36 and @entity25 used the raid to criticize @placeholder challenger @entity22	@entity23	( @entity0 ) -- it may have been @entity2 's most dramatic moment as president so far , and it certainly did n't go unmentioned as he accepted the @entity5 nomination for a second term thursday night . speaker after speaker reminded the audience in the convention hall and beyond that @entity12 leader @entity11 -- the mastermind of 9/11 , public enemy no. 1 for a decade -- had been gunned down by @entity14 commandos in @entity15 16 months ago . they reminded everyone that it was @entity2 who had given the order . some of them also used the opportunity to question whether @entity2 's challenger , @entity23 presidential nominee @entity22 , would have made the same call . " after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of @entity14 murdered on 9/11 -- after @entity22 said it would be ' naive ' to go into @entity15 to pursue the terrorists -- it took president @entity2 , against the advice of many , to give that order to finally rid this earth of @entity11 , " said sen. @entity25 , @entity26 . " ask @entity11 if he is better off now than he was four years ago . " fact check : the not - so - empty factory vice president @entity36 , meanwhile , recounted the day in the @entity37 when @entity2 made the decision to launch the raid , " and justice was done . " " @entity41 , governor @entity22 did n't see things that way . when he was asked about @entity11 in 2007 , he said , and i quote , ' it 's not worth moving heaven and @entity48 and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person , ' " @entity36 said to boos from the audience . the facts : in august 2007 , @entity2 explicitly warned that if @entity14 authorities identify a " high - value " target like @entity11 in @entity15 , and if @entity15 's government does n't act , " we will . " @entity22 , then mounting his first @entity37 bid , criticized @entity2 's speech a few days later . " i mean , in one week , he went from saying he 's going to sit down , you know , for tea , with our enemies , but then he 's going to bomb our allies , " @entity22 said during a @entity23 debate . " i mean , he 's gone from @entity64 to dr. @entity65 in one week . " he added , " we do n't say those things . we keep our options quiet . we do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us , where we have collaborated and they are our friend and we 're trying to support @entity72 and strengthen him and his nation , that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack . " @entity22 already had been pressed by his @entity23 rivals to clarify remarks he 'd made about @entity11 that april , when he told @entity78 that " it 's not worth moving heaven and @entity48 and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person . " but he also said that he would target the entire @entity12 terror network , not just its leader . he defended the comments at another @entity23 presidential debate , saying the movement was " more than @entity11 . but he is going to pay , and he is going to die . " this may , a year after the raid , @entity22 complained that the @entity2 administration was politicizing the raid when it cited those comments . in defending his position again , @entity22 said it was n't the idea of striking at @entity11 on the territory of an ally that bothered him -- it was that @entity2 said publicly that he would do so . " there are many people who believed as i did that it was naive on the part of the president , at the time as a candidate , to say he would go into @entity15 , " @entity22 said . " it was a very -- if you will -- a fragile and flammable time in @entity15 , and i thought it was a mistake of him as a candidate for the presidency of the @entity14 to announce that he would go in . " fact check : @entity114 arithmetic holds up on jobs during the 2008 campaign , @entity22 was n't the only one critical of @entity2 , who had been elected to the @entity118 only four years earlier . among those who called his position " naive " were @entity2 's eventual @entity23 opponent , sen. @entity122 ; and @entity36 , then one of his @entity5 rivals . both used the term " naive " to describe @entity2 's counterterrorism speech . when @entity2 did order the raid , he did it against the advice of some of his top aides . then - defense secretary @entity131 has said he wanted to hit the compound where @entity11 was holed up from the air rather than dispatch a @entity135 seal team , while @entity36 said in january that he advised @entity2 that more details needed to be checked before sending in troops . conclusion : @entity22 was critical of @entity2 's position in the days following the future president 's august 2007 speech . @entity36 's speech thursday night left out some context about @entity22 's remarks , and @entity25 mischaracterized @entity22 's comments -- @entity22 did n't say attacking targets in @entity15 was naive but talking about it publicly was . also , @entity36 himself once characterized @entity2 's comments as naive . fact check : would @entity22 bankrupt @entity150 by 2016 ? @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .	@entity22:Romney	@entity23:Republican	@entity26:D-Massachusetts	@entity25:Kerry	@entity114:Clinton	@entity135:U.S. Navy	@entity151:Matt Smith	@entity150:Medicare	@entity131:Bill Gates	@entity118:Senate	@entity2:Obama	@entity0:CNN	@entity11:Osama bin Laden	@entity5:Democratic	@entity78:The Associated Press	@entity72:Musharraf	@entity15:Pakistan	@entity14:United States	@entity12:al Qaeda	@entity37:White House	@entity36:Biden	@entity122:John McCain	@entity41:Folks	@entity64:Jane Fonda	@entity65:Strangelove	@entity48:Earth
former @placeholder coach @entity1 says he wants to further his experiences	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- former @entity2 manager @entity1 has resigned as coach of @entity5 club @entity4 amid reports linking him with the vacant job at @entity8 . @entity1 has only been in charge at @entity10 for a season , joining the @entity13 - based club seven months after he was sacked by @entity2 . he led @entity4 to eighth place in the @entity16 last season and the club qualified for @entity20 's @entity19 competition due to their standing in @entity20 's fair play table . @entity1 said he wanted a new challenge but insisted he had n't been approached by any other club . in a statement he said : " i hope the supporters and all those connected with the club will understand i wish to move on to further my experiences .

" i would like to thank the chairman , directors , players and fans of @entity4 for their support over the last 12 months and wish them every success in the future , " he added . " i believe my management team and i have done a good job and the club has a strong foundation from which they can go forward .

@placeholder : men remain more powerful in workplace , so rules must be consistent	@entity238	( @entity0 ) -- in my mind -- and in the law -- there are two kinds of sexual harassment . the first kind is quid pro quo and easy to spot . a really detestable ( usually ) man gives his ( usually ) female subordinate employee or student an ultimatum : put out or lose some opportunity , be it a grade , a job or a promotion . during the " @entity20 " era , bosses got away with such , and women thought it the price of a life outside the kitchen . no more . women no longer think this is ok . professors even lose tenure over this clearly sexist and illegal behavior these days . we 've come a long way on the road to equality on this front . lawyers do n't settle such claims for a few months ' salary and a promise of silence . no one knows right now if this is the kind of sexual harassment that @entity44 is accused of , but i doubt it . for one thing , several others have claimed they witnessed the harassment of the women in question , and such bold threats are n't often made over the dinner table in a restaurant with observers . but then there is the other kind of sexual harassment , the behavior that makes the workplace uncomfortable , that creates an environment that is hostile to women in general , or just to one person because of her ( or his ) sex , gender , race or ethnicity . everyone agrees that workplaces ought not to differentiate between actors simply because of their sex , gender , race or ethnicity . but beyond that , when sex and gender are involved , we often get into a " he said / she said " dialogue . for example , he believed the jokes were simply funny and created a more friendly setting ; she believed they were offensive and created an us ( the boys ) versus them ( her or her and other women ) organizational climate where she was always going to be outside the loop , outside informal conversations and social networks that mattered . another example might be when a powerful man is attracted to one of his co-workers and simply wants to start some sort of sexual friendship , an offer he perhaps had made many times before and occasionally was accepted . but this time , the woman finds a sexual overture from a married boss intimidating and off - putting . she believes it changes forever the climate of the workplace . even if he never threatened her status after the " invitation , " she did n't believe the professional relationship would ever be the same after what she perceived to be sexual harassment . if we look at sexual harassment in these terms , as he said / she said , we will never find a solution -- ethical , legal or moral to the problem . at this point , we have yet to create any consensus around the appropriate way to deal with sexual attraction and sexual desire in the workplace . no one can deny that workplaces are often where adults meet their life partners . in a 24/7 work environment , where else do you have to meet a spouse ? and indeed , in a world where people often think of themselves as defined by " what they do , " it makes sense that those who also do it are the people we have enough in common with to fall for , whether it 's to fall in love , or even just in lust . and yet , we are still in a world where the most powerful class of actors happens to be older men . we do not live in some post-feminist world , where power is yet equally shared . no one wants to anger or displease one 's boss , even a little . nor do we live in a world where the workplaces have become truly integrated by sex . in fact , the most recent research suggests that in the last decade , we 've stalled at integration by sex . while women are getting more and more of the degrees , they remain in traditionally female - dominated fields , and are not moving forward in male - dominated ones . my hypothesis for why is that heavily male - dominated occupations , including politics , are so heavily masculine in their cultures , full of sexual innuendo and -- perhaps -- the kind of sexual harassment of which @entity44 is accused . i do n't have an easy answer , but i do know we 'll never solve the problem by trying to figure out what he said or she said . instead , we have to decide what , as a society , we want to be acceptable or not in our workplaces and schools and then enforce the norms with legal penalties . here 's a first volley : it should be illegal for men ( or women ) to make sexual overtures to their subordinates . end of story . power always gets in the way of easily saying no. but more than that , if we want workplaces that do not privilege the men who have previously dominated the social space , we need to change the culture in which sexual banter objectifies women and turns them into the " other , " and take seriously the claims by women that men harass them . the more subtle kind of sexual harassment has consequences not only for the individual woman who finally complains , but for all of us , by sustaining a culture where the powerful positions in many occupations , including politics , remain dominated by men . should accepting boorish sexual banter and unwanted sexual approaches be the price of admission to male - dominated occupations ? it 's up to us as a society to set the standards . here is a moment in time to take stock : let 's hear what the women who were silenced by being paid off have to say about the private behavior of a very public man who is running for president . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .	@entity44:Cain	@entity20:Mad Men	@entity0:CNN	@entity238:Risman
he says @entity13 and @placeholder theology now play a key role in the @entity3	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- there was a time when the @entity3 was strictly for @entity4 . it was an alliance between @entity6 and twice born followers of the @entity8 , all firmly opposed to mass @entity10 immigration from @entity11 . the nativism of the @entity3 drove @entity13 into the welcoming arms of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 . but this year 's @entity3 front - runners are a @entity20 and two @entity13 -- @entity21 ( a cradle of @entity24 descent ) and @entity25 ( a convert ) . roughly one - quarter of @entity3 primary voters are @entity10 . notable catholic @entity3 leaders include @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 . six out of nine justices of the @entity35 are @entity13 , and five of them are @entity3 . the @entity3 is undergoing a quiet process of @entity38 . it 's one of the reasons why this year 's race has focused so much on social issues -- and sex . @entity3 outreach to @entity13 began in the early 1970s , when @entity45 tried to entice blue - collar " white ethnics " to the @entity3 by taking a tough stand on abortion . @entity45 told members of his staff he was tempted to convert to @entity10 himself , but was worried it would be seen as cheap politics : " they would say there goes @entity45 trying to win the @entity10 vote . ... " @entity45 genuinely admired the @entity10 intellectual tradition and its ability to provide reasonable arguments to defend conservative values at a time when they were undergoing widespread reappraisal . that certainly made the @entity13 an invaluable partner during the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s . when the @entity68 was established in 1979 to oppose things like abortion and homosexual rights , its evangelical founders did their best to include @entity13 . despite the organization 's reputation for being the political voice box of televangelists and peddlers of the apocalypse , by the mid ' 80s it drew a third of its funding from @entity10 donors . leaders like @entity83 and @entity84 consciously used the @entity68 ( and , later , the @entity85 ) as an exercise in ecumenical coalition building . @entity83 and @entity84 were fans of @entity89 and his resilient anti-communism . but they also recognized , like @entity45 , that the @entity13 had a vast intellectual heritage that could be drawn upon when fighting the liberals . for example , when debating abortion , evangelicals had hitherto tended to rely on @entity97 to make their case . @entity13 , on the other hand , had been integrating the concept of " human rights " into their theology since the 1890s . under @entity10 influence , the pro-life movement evolved from a zealous , theology - heavy rationale to one more couched in the language of human dignity and personhood . by 2000 , catholic social teaching was a core component of the @entity3 's " compassionate conservatism " agenda . @entity114 targeted religious @entity13 on behalf of @entity115 , while the president made a big play of his social traditionalism . in the 2004 election , @entity33 beat @entity120 among @entity13 , despite the fact that @entity120 described himself as a faithful @entity10 who never went anywhere without his rosary beads . crucially , @entity33 's victory among @entity13 was made possible by his margin of support among those who attend @entity128 regularly . catholics who said they rarely went to church plumped for @entity120 . the election heralded a new split within the politics of the communion , between religious and ethnic @entity13 . indeed , it could be argued that just as @entity3 @entity136 have become a little more catholic in their outlook , so conservative @entity13 have become a little more @entity136 in theirs . take @entity21 . @entity21 is part of the @entity89 generation of @entity13 who reject most of the liberalism that swept the church in the 1960s . he is a member of a suburban church in @entity145 , @entity146 , that ( unusually , nowadays ) offers a @entity128 each sunday with a @entity148 chant sung by a professional choir . the church has a " garden for the unborn " and has boasted as worshipers the director of the @entity151 , the head of the @entity152 and justice @entity153 . @entity21 is also an outspoken admirer of @entity157 , the founder of the conservative lay organization @entity158 . @entity158 encourages among its members a work ethic and an effort to " live like a saint " that is strikingly similar to the values and mores of @entity168 's @entity167 settlers . @entity21 's political theology has thus moved him so sharply to the right that it 's sometimes difficult to culturally identify him as a @entity10 . in a march 18 survey , less than half of @entity3 @entity13 actually knew the candidate was himself a @entity10 . that might be one of the reasons why @entity21 consistently loses to @entity177 among @entity13 in primaries , even during his landmark victories in the @entity180 . in contrast , he does very well among evangelicals . we might speculate that what is emerging is an alliance between ultra-conservative @entity13 and tea party evangelicals . its politics might be antediluvian , but it 's an ecumenical breakthrough and a cultural revolution at the grass - roots level . the coalition 's mix of catholic moral teaching and evangelical fervor has oriented the 2012 @entity3 race toward fierce social conservatism . during the debate over @entity201 's contraception mandate , it was the @entity10 conservative leadership who provided the moral objection , but the evangelicals who produced most of the popular opposition to it . and it is evangelical support that has elevated @entity21 to his current status in the race . with its ability to shift the agenda and win primaries , the emerging @entity10 / evangelical political theology is the most striking conservative innovation of this turbulent campaign season . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .	@entity17:Tip O'Neill	@entity20:Mormon	@entity21:Santorum	@entity24:Italian	@entity16:Jack Kennedy	@entity29:John Boehner	@entity15:Al Smith	@entity97:Scripture	@entity115:George W.

@placeholder is shooting for hauling in $ 1 billion for the 2012 race	@entity24	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the presidential campaign fundraising numbers being reported paint a picture of what 's to come over the 13 months until the 2012 election : a flood of television ads , cross-country bus tours and a lot of handshakes . money drives a campaign , and fundraising is a signal of its strength . it also allows campaigns to get ahead in the media wars -- on tv , radio , online , in the mail -- and on - the - ground grassroots outreach . president @entity24 's campaign has pledged to raise an eye - popping $ 1 billion for his re-election campaign -- an unheard of figure in @entity30 politics -- @entity24 's campaign raised nearly $ 750 million for the 2008 election . to put that into perspective , @entity34 presidential candidate @entity33 raised $ 239 million from donors and received $ 84 million collected from public funds -- something that @entity24 chose not to participate in . so why does it cost so much to campaign for election in the @entity30 ? bigger country = bigger money " @entity30 is the largest democracy in the world and that 's going to cost a lot of money to express yourself and get your message out , get the vote out , get people to support you and put in ( campaign ) infrastructure , " said @entity34 strategist @entity44 . in order for a candidate to reach all 50 states within an election cycle , a trove of money will be needed to cover that much ground . and then there 's length of @entity30 campaigns . @entity67 , a @entity68 strategist and former staffer on @entity71 's successful 1992 campaign , said the length of the @entity30 election cycle dictates that candidates must pile up funds to survive the long haul . " if you 're running for prime minister in @entity79 , you do n't spend a year and a half or two years running for office , " he said . " the election is called and the opposition party decides it 's going to mount a campaign and you have a concentrated time to focus on that . " ( under @entity79 's parliamentary system , the party with the most votes becomes the ruling party , and that in turn determines who becomes the prime minister ) . in @entity79 , a law known as the @entity94 regulates campaign spending -- anything from party political broadcasts , advertising , rallies and even " issuing disparaging material relating to another party or its candidates , " according to the government 's website . in 2010 , the parties and their candidates were regulated by time frames : the " long campaign " -- from january 1 to april 12 when @entity109 was dissolved √¢ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äù and the " short campaign " from the dissolution of @entity109 through election day . according to the website , the long campaign had a limit of 25,000 pounds ( about $ 39,000 ) and 7,150 pounds ( about $ 11,200 ) for the short campaign . the ad wars television advertising is by far the most expensive item in a campaign 's budget . air time in major markets in key swing states can cost a campaign millions of dollars . @entity24 spent much of his money in 2008 advertising in large -- and expensive -- markets in battleground states . the eventual @entity34 nominee will have to blanket those markets , too . and that 's when big @entity34 donors will come calling , @entity44 said . " a lot of wealthy donors are waiting on the sidelines waiting to see who the @entity34 candidate is going to be to get behind , " @entity44 said . " once that happens it will be very competitive with president @entity24 . " @entity44 believes that @entity34 will be successful in attracting younger voters and small donors this time around -- something @entity24 capitalized on in 2008 . @entity67 said the fear for the @entity24 campaign is that because the economy is weak and republicans are eager , if not desperate , to replace him , he has to cover all his bases . he needs the support not only of his liberal base but moderates and independents , too -- and do everything he can to get his message out . " part of the problem he has had as president is that despite very effective communication effort as a campaigner , he has n't been effective in communicating his successes while he 's been governing , " he said . " and he 's going to have to do that more effectively in the coming months . " it 's not just tv ads that deplete a campaign 's bank account -- it 's the entire get - out - the - vote effort . " i think elections have become more costly because more money is spent on television advertising , on a national campaign infrastructure ... campaign planes , the buses , the whole movement from city to city , " @entity44 said . in countries such as @entity79 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , for example , candidates can blanket media markets with less money . and there are restrictions in some countries on how many ads can air . big vs. small @entity24 's campaign was able to raise $ 42.8 million between july and the end of september , an @entity24 campaign aide told @entity1 . between the campaign and the @entity198 , they raised more than $ 70 million in the third quarter . some @entity68 sources had earlier expected the combined total to be $ 55 million . read more on @entity24 's fundraising numbers the $ 42 million figure most likely will be close to or exceed the total raised by all of the @entity34 presidential candidates together for this quarter . of numbers released by @entity34 campaigns before they have to formally submit their fundraising to the @entity212 , @entity208 gov. @entity207 's campaign said it raised $ 17 million , former @entity215 gov. @entity214 's campaign estimated it raised between $ 11 million and $ 14 million and @entity208 rep. @entity217 's campaign said it raised around $ 8 million . other @entity34 campaigns did not release their figures ahead of the deadline . in the second quarter -- running between april and june -- @entity24 's campaign was able to raise a record - setting $ 87 million . the campaign released a list of more than 270 fundraisers -- so - called " bundlers " -- who helped bring in at least $ 50,000 for the campaign and the joint @entity229 victory fund . in addition , 31 people raised more than $ 500,000 including @entity233 producer @entity232 , @entity235 editor @entity234 and former @entity237 gov. and @entity30 sen. @entity238 . bundlers are an integral part of campaign fundraising efforts , since individual donations are limited . while federal election law requires campaigns to disclose the names of donors of more than $ 250 , there is no requirement to reveal the names of bundlers . @entity24 was able to rake in a large part of his 2008 campaign funds from a swath of small donors -- most of them young . this year he is hoping to get those donors back . shortly after he announced his 2012 campaign in early april , his staff reported around 23,000 small donors -- who typically give anywhere from $ 25 to $ 100 -- gave to the campaign . " @entity24 was largely successful at getting small donors through the social media phenomenon created around his campaign , " @entity44 said . " now the @entity34 are mimicking that . so i think they 'll be much more competitive with that . " where 's it coming from ? @entity67 and other activists believe that too many politicians are guided by special interest groups and wealthy donors -- not the average @entity30 @entity272 . " we have a campaign financing system that is a grotesque way out of touch with reality of the @entity30 people , " @entity67 said . " you have to be wealthy or in touch with the very wealthy in order to get elected to almost any political office -- not just the presidency . because of that , corporations and outside groups tend to have a large influence in our elections . and on january 11 , the @entity288 ruled that big business , unions and nonprofits now have more power to spend freely in federal elections . a 5 - 4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending . the justices eased long - standing restrictions on " independent spending " by corporations and unions in political campaigns . read more about the case shortly after the ruling , @entity24 blasted the decision saying " the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in @entity0 -- while undermining the influence of average @entity30 who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates . " @entity67 added that there seems to be a concerted effort to protect the corporate interests and the moneyed interests " because those are the people who write the rules . " the past is the past the @entity212 has a breakdown of presidential campaign receipts ( in millions of dollars ) going back to the 1996 presidential race , that shows how dramatically campaign fundraising and spending has multiplied in a short time : 2004 @entity326 : $ 269.6 @entity327 : $ 234.6 2000 @entity326 : $ 95.5 @entity328 : $ 48.1 1996 @entity71 : $ 42.5 @entity329 : $ 44.9 @entity1 's @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report .	@entity24:Obama	@entity184:France	@entity185:Mexico	@entity332:Rob Yoon	@entity331:Bill Mears	@entity330:Kevin Bohn	@entity272:Joe	@entity214:Mitt Romney	@entity215:Massachusetts	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity237:New Jersey	@entity212:Federal Elections Commission	@entity198:Democratic National Committee	@entity238:Jon Corzine	@entity232:Jeffrey Katzenberg	@entity79:Britain	@entity71:Bill Clinton	@entity30:Americans	@entity33:John McCain	@entity34:Republicans	@entity233:Hollywood	@entity217:Ron Paul	@entity109:Parliament	@entity94:Political Parties , Elections and Referendums Act 2000	@entity207:Rick Perry	@entity326:Bush	@entity327:John Kerry	@entity234:Anna Wintour	@entity229:Obama for America-Democratic National Committee	@entity235:Vogue	@entity328:Al Gore	@entity329:Bob Dole	@entity186:Spain	@entity44:Bonjean	@entity208:Texas	@entity68:Democratic	@entity67:Boykin	@entity288:Supreme Court
@placeholder scores twice to keep up his remarkable tally of goals this season	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 striker @entity1 continued his superb scoring streak this season , netting another double as @entity6 beat @entity8 champions @entity7 2 - 1 in the @entity9 to clinch top spot in @entity11 and secure qualification for the last 16 . captain @entity13 had already found the net 15 times for @entity6 this season , and he added another one to his tally in the 49th minute when he headed home after some superb individual play on the left from @entity20 . and @entity13 wrapped up a comfortable night for the @entity21 when scoring his 17th goal from just 18 matches , tapping home from close range after @entity27 's corner had been flicked on at the near post by @entity29 . @entity7 did pull one back through @entity30 with the final kick of the game , but it was too late to make a difference as @entity6 made it eight wins and a draw from their last nine matches , following a poor start to the season . @entity40 needs to be given more time @entity6 are on 11 points , four clear of @entity45 champions @entity43 , who stunned @entity47 1 - 0 in @entity48 . @entity49 netted a late winner to leave @entity43 third on six points , one point behind @entity47 , with @entity7 bottom of the table on four points . however , there is a scenario that could see all those teams finish on seven points , if @entity43 draw with @entity6 and @entity7 defeat @entity47 in the final group matches in a fortnight . meanwhile , there was drama in @entity66 , with @entity67 scoring a last - gasp winner against @entity69 to virtually secure their place in the last 16 with a 2 - 1 victory . an injury time header from defender @entity74 saw the home side fight back from going a goal down , to inflict @entity69 's fourth defeat in seven matches and increase the pressure on under - fire manager @entity40 . the visitors went ahead three minutes after the break when @entity82 turned smartly in the area before firing into the bottom corner of the net . but the @entity8 side levelled in the 73rd minute when substitute @entity87 headed into an empty net after goalkeeper @entity89 came off his line to try and intercept @entity92 's superb cross . and @entity74 rose highest from a corner in the dying stages to secure a stunning comeback for @entity67 . that result leaves @entity67 on nine points , one clear of @entity69 and @entity98 , who crushed @entity100 7 - 0 at the @entity101 . @entity102 scored a first - half hat - trick for the @entity105 side to leave qualification finely poised . if @entity69 beat @entity98 , or draw 0 - 0 at @entity108 in their final match , they will qualify , while @entity67 need to avoid defeat against @entity100 to also go through . defending champions @entity111 had already secured qualification , but a 3 - 2 victory over @entity113 at the @entity114 ensured they will go through as @entity116 winners , with @entity113 in second place . @entity111 took a 14th minute lead when @entity119 turned @entity121 's cross into his own net but @entity113 leveled six minutes later when @entity111 old boy @entity124 's shot crept under goalkeeper @entity125 . @entity126 restored @entity111 's lead from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after @entity129 had fouled @entity130 in the area , but once again @entity113 equalized with a superb individual goal from @entity133 . however , @entity111 were not to be denied and they clinched the win when @entity126 picked out @entity130 , who expertly slotted home . in the other group game , @entity137 side @entity136 secured their first - ever competition win with a 1 - 0 success at @entity141 , to move onto four points , while @entity141 remain bottom on two points . meanwhile , outsiders @entity146 have become the first @entity148 club to reach the last 16 after a 0 -

0 at @entity165 in the other group match . @entity163 entertain @entity150 in their final group game , with the winners going through alongside @entity146 , although a draw would also see @entity150 go through .	@entity20:Alex Song	@entity21:Gunners	@entity150:Zenit	@entity27:Mikel Arteta	@entity29:Thomas Vermaelen	@entity116:Group H	@entity82:Didier Drogba	@entity114:San Siro	@entity113:AC Milan	@entity111:Barcelona	@entity87:Eren Derdiyok	@entity89:Petr Cech	@entity137:Czech	@entity136:Viktoria Plzen	@entity130:Xavi	@entity119:Mark van Bommel	@entity2:Dutch	@entity1:Robin van Persie	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Borussia Dortmund	@entity6:Arsenal	@entity9:Champions League	@entity8:German	@entity133:Kevin-Prince Boateng	@entity74:Friedrich	@entity30:Shinji Kagawa	@entity13:Van Persie	@entity11:Group F	@entity43:Olympiakos	@entity100:Genk	@entity101:Mestalla stadium	@entity102:Roberto Soldado	@entity105:Spanish	@entity98:Valencia	@entity126:Messi	@entity124:Zlatan Ibrahimovic	@entity125:Victor Valdes	@entity92:Sidney Sam	@entity121:Seydou Keita	@entity108:Stamford Bridge	@entity163:Porto	@entity146:APOEL	@entity141:BATE	@entity151:Russian	@entity165:Shakhtar Donetsk	@entity148:Cypriot	@entity149:Group G	@entity129:Alberto Aquilani	@entity45:Greek	@entity47:Marseille	@entity40:Andre Villas-Boas	@entity69:Chelsea	@entity66:Group E	@entity67:Bayer Leverkusen	@entity48:France	@entity49:Koannis Fetfatzidis
@entity94 envoy @placeholder sees positive signs in @entity0 , along with concerns	@entity92	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- a deadline set by @entity1 's new leaders for the surrender of the towns of @entity7 and @entity8 , bastions of hardcore supporters of @entity11 , passed at midnight friday without any apparent deal . before the deadline expired , a spokesman for the @entity14 said talks with loyalists were continuing into the evening . absent a resolution , " it 's up to military planners to decide how to move forward , " @entity18 @entity17 said . sticking points included the demand by @entity16 for @entity14 fighters to enter their communities unarmed , and to refrain from searching houses . the loyalists also asked for blanket pardons , but the @entity14 wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands , @entity17 said . @entity7 is on the @entity33 coast east of @entity0 , and @entity8 is southeast of the capital . a military spokesman , citing heavy resistance from loyalists in @entity8 , said @entity39 forces had retreated friday . @entity14 media committee spokesman @entity40 said fighting for @entity7 was taking place 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) east of the city . @entity44 said @entity14 fighters were met with small - arms fire as they advanced from the east , and a battle ensued with heavy artillery . a @entity50 hospital received a number of casualties , he said . earlier , @entity53 , an @entity14 chief negotiator , had told @entity2 that @entity39 fighters had been just 1.5 kilometers , nearly a mile , from the center of @entity8 , situated on the north , east and south . anti-gadhafi fighters captured seven loyalists , including a brigadier general , he said , and three loyalists were killed . an @entity39 fighter was killed and four others were wounded , @entity53 said . @entity2 was not able to independently verify his account . inside @entity8 , meanwhile , pro- and @entity39 groups clashed , but @entity14 fighters were not involved , said @entity65 , assistant to the commander of @entity68 's southern front . @entity17 also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured @entity14 fighters to @entity72 for use as human shields . that town is 10 miles east of @entity7 . @entity76 , chairman of the @entity14 executive board , will visit @entity68 on saturday to survey the damage in the city , where he has tribal ties , @entity17 said . the developments came as @entity82 issued @entity84 arrest warrants friday for @entity11 , who is wanted by the @entity85 in the @entity86 for alleged crimes against humanity . a red notice allows @entity82 , the international police agency , to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the @entity85 . at the @entity94 , @entity92 , the secretary - general 's special envoy to @entity1 , told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster in the capital have not materialized . city infrastructure has suffered little damage , the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated , supplies of fuel and electricity are improving , schools are slated to reopen september 17 , and there has been no general breakdown of public order , said @entity92 , who had earlier briefed the @entity110 after his return from five days in @entity1 . " that 's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict " cities , he said . but those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face . a @entity119 has been established in @entity0 to bring all armed elements under a single command , but " the proliferation of weapons is a major concern , including to @entity1 's neighbors , " @entity92 said . " the approach they 're taking is to , at this stage , tell the very top echelon of the military , the police , the civil service , to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future , " he said . despite appeals by @entity14 leaders , acts of revenge have been carried out , " especially of @entity143 accused -- often , i think , quite wrongly -- of having fought for the @entity11 regime , " he said . in addition , " terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the @entity11 regime , both those that took place over many years and during the fall of @entity0 , when many of the prisoners were massacred , " @entity92 said . " this is going to be a very heavy burden for @entity1 's new leaders as they seek to show that there will be accountability within the law for the worst violations , but at the same time promote national reconciliation . " the weight of that burden was underscored by a report by @entity165 that 18 bodies were discovered thursday in western @entity1 . the find corroborates reports by two survivors that the dead had been detainees held by @entity11 forces in the town of @entity174 who were killed in june . the dead suffocated when they were locked inside two metal shipping containers , the group said . a captured @entity11 soldier led officials from the military council of @entity174 , about 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) east of @entity0 , to the bodies , which were buried between @entity8 and @entity183 , @entity165 said . " the @entity11 forces threw detainees in metal containers with little water and air on a brutally hot day , and refused to let them out despite cries for help , " said @entity184 , special adviser at @entity165 . a 19th person died a few days later , so was not buried with the other 18 , the group said . a video that appears to have been shot by a @entity11 soldier shows several of the detainees -- blindfolded and bound -- being kicked and whipped inside the container . meanwhile , an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation , @entity94 envoy @entity92 said . until then , the @entity14 is assuming " caretaker responsibilities " to carry out urgently needed functions , he added . @entity94 secretary - general @entity203 has proposed a support mission for three months , after which " we would then go back to the @entity110 for a longer mandate , " @entity92 said . @entity2 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .	@entity82:Interpol	@entity84:Red Notice	@entity85:ICC	@entity86:Hague	@entity110:Security Council	@entity119:Supreme Security Committee	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Libyan	@entity0:Tripoli	@entity7:Sirte	@entity174:al-Khoms	@entity8:Bani Walid	@entity92:Martin	@entity53:Kenshill	@entity50:Benghazi	@entity165:Human Rights Watch	@entity76:Mahmoud Jibril	@entity72:Qasr Bu Hadi	@entity17:Ben Ali	@entity16:Gadhafi loyalists	@entity33:Mediterranean	@entity14:NTC	@entity11:Gadhafi	@entity39:anti-Gadhafi	@entity18:Shamsuddin	@entity209:Umaro Djau	@entity208:Jim Bittermann	@entity203:Ban Ki-moon	@entity94:U.N.	@entity207:Ian Lee	@entity206:Kareem Khadder	@entity143:sub-Saharan Africans	@entity183:Orban	@entity184:Fred Abrahams	@entity44:El Gallal	@entity40:Jalal el Gallal	@entity68:Misrata	@entity65:Badr Abu Shahma

" i pushed him off because jumpers like @entity11 are very selfish . their action violates a lot of public interest , " @entity21 told @entity8 .

one of @entity14 's top players , @placeholder , to start match on bench	@entity87	your co-workers will bolt from work early today . bars will make a killing . and even the most indifferent of your friends will feign a slight interest in the @entity8 . for today , the @entity9 begins its @entity11 adventure when it goes toe - to - toe with its nemesis , @entity14 . the @entity14 have knocked the @entity9 out of competition the last two go - rounds -- in 2006 and 2010 . can the @entity9 avoid a three - peat ? it 'd better , if it wants to see its @entity8 ambitions stay alive . because after @entity14 , the @entity9 takes on two giants : @entity20 and @entity21 -- ranked by @entity22 as the second - and fourth - best teams in the world . for its part , the @entity9 is ranked 13th . @entity14 is 37th . no wonder @entity26 -- the one the @entity9 finds itself in -- has been nicknamed the " @entity27 . " why focus on the negative though ? sure , @entity30 's odds of lifting the most coveted soccer trophy in the world are 100 to 1 . but the 23 players on the squad have dreamed of playing on the grandest stage of soccer since they were kids . @entity37 , 32 , was one of them . as a child , he 'd leave notes for his mom , signed , " @entity42 # 15 .

" to have the opportunity to represent our country , to wear our colors , there 's nothing else like it . " why you should worry @entity14 has n't been kind to @entity30 's @entity8 soccer aspirations . it knocked out the @entity9 from the group stage in 2006 with a 2 - 1 win . in 2010 , the @entity9 gave them a run for the money . but alas , an extra-time goal from @entity14 -- in the 93rd minute -- sent the @entity9 packing once again , 2 - 1 . seven players from the 2010 @entity67 team are back monday , including the lightning - fast @entity68 , the team captain . they 're unpredictable . and the @entity9 will have to be ready for anything . why you should n't worry in the warm - up matches ahead of the tournament , the @entity9 won all three of its games -- against @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 . @entity14 lost two of its three -- to @entity79 and the @entity80 .

@placeholder 's interim interior minister says torture in the country will be eradicated	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- a former prison guard responsible for leaking videos purportedly showing the abuse of prisoners at a penitentiary in the former @entity7 republic of @entity8 said friday that he witnessed such torture on a daily basis since 2005 . " while working in prison , i used to witness beating of prisoners , torture of prisoners , humiliation of prisoners on an everyday basis , " @entity11 told @entity0 . the acts were recorded in four videos that were made public this week and show prisoners being physically and sexually assaulted , humiliated and verbally abused by prison officers . purported prison abuse videos prompt outrage in @entity8 @entity11 left the country three months ago and is now seeking political asylum in @entity25 in the wake of the tapes ' release . @entity8 television stations , including @entity30 , broadcast the videos tuesday night . the faces of those being filmed were obscured . one man cries out while he is being raped with a broom handle . another video shows an inmate being punched . @entity11 slammed the administration of president @entity39 , accusing the leader of allowing a " campaign of torture , humiliation " under former interior minister @entity44 . " i have been working in the system since 2001 , but since 2005 when @entity44 was put in charge , he introduced his criminal elements of leadership , " @entity11 said . @entity44 resigned his post thursday after the videos ' release prompted outrage both inside and outside the @entity55 country . @entity8 's minister of corrections and legal assistance has also stepped down . and @entity58 himself condemned the abuse , saying wednesday that what occurred at @entity63 penitentiary in @entity64 is " a horrific affront to human rights and human dignity . " @entity11 said he had been collecting the footage for more than a year . " when i realized that i could not take it any more , i decided to reveal it and depart for @entity75 , " he said , calling for @entity39 to resign and accusing the president of establishing " a criminal government with the leadership of @entity72 . " his comments echo a key allegation made by @entity8 's opposition , which says senior government officials sanctioned the abuse . @entity39 has said an active investigation is under way into those responsible , with some arrests already taking place . the country 's interior ministry on tuesday blamed certain prison employees for the degrading treatment . the ministry said a prisoner at the facility offered " substantial reimbursement " to employees for their actions and the video recordings . its statement did not elaborate on the prisoner 's motivation . the interior ministry identified that prisoner as @entity101 , father - in - law of @entity102 , a member of the opposition @entity104 party . @entity102 said @entity101 's life was in danger and that he was being held " hostage " by the president . @entity101 had nothing to do with the taped incidents , @entity102 said . @entity11 insisted that he has no political motivations for releasing the videos , and said he is not affiliated with any political party . " they made up a lie that i was paid by the opposition leader ... and meant to use it to benefit the opposition . this was not my goal . i left the country independently , " he said . meanwhile friday , the @entity122 added its voice to a chorus of condemnation over the abuse . the @entity127 called on the @entity8 government to ensure that these allegations are " promptly , impartially and effectively investigated and that perpetrators are brought to justice , " spokesman @entity130 said . " we condemn the acts of torture and ill - treatment perpetrated against inmates at a prison and a juvenile detention facility in @entity8 , " @entity130 added . he said the victims must have access to medical and psychological support . interim interior minister @entity142 said that the country has built strong state institutions over the years and that all torture will be eradicated . the country 's prisons were notoriously corrupt places where organized crime ruled , but those days are over , she said , citing personal experience . " i allow myself to state this , as 18 years ago , i myself was the victim of police violence , and therefore , i am fully aware of my words and situation that we have in @entity8 today , " @entity142 said . torture is absolutely prohibited under human rights law , @entity130 said in @entity159 , and @entity8 has ratified the @entity160 . he praised the condemnation of the videos by @entity8 's president and urged the government to stand by its promise to investigate all alleged human rights abuses , not just the ones exposed this week . read more about @entity168 on @entity0 @entity169 contributed to this report .	@entity25:Belgium	@entity159:Geneva	@entity130:Colville	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Soviet	@entity8:Georgia	@entity55:Eurasian	@entity75:Europe	@entity58:Saaskashvili	@entity72:Akhalaia	@entity30:TV9	@entity11:Bedukadze	@entity39:Saakashvili	@entity101:Tamazashvili	@entity102:Garibashvili	@entity104:Georgian Dream	@entity127:Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights	@entity122:U.N.	@entity160:United Nations Convention Against Torture	@entity142:Zghuladze	@entity168:Human Rights Watch	@entity169:NuNu Japaridze	@entity44:Akhalaia	@entity64:Tbilisi	@entity63:Gldani No. 8
@placeholder was sentenced to life in prison in 2013	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- if you 're even remotely familiar with @entity5 's @entity4 neighborhood and the @entity7 gangs that once dominated it , you know who @entity9 is . @entity9 eluded federal authorities for more than 16 years before his arrest in june 2011 . now 85 , @entity9 is a convicted murderer , serving the rest of his life in prison for a litany of crimes , including his role in 11 murders , although he 's appealing his conviction . his crimes were thoroughly detailed throughout his high - profile murder trial , but here are six things you might not know about this infamous @entity5 gang leader : 1 . he 'd rather be in @entity27 already in prison for armed robbery , @entity9 was sent to the now - defunct federal prison on @entity27 off @entity32 's shoreline in november 1959 after allegedly planning a prison escape in @entity34 . he spent three years in @entity27 before his eventual release in 1965 . shortly after @entity9 's 2011 capture , @entity27 historian and author @entity36 wrote to the imprisoned @entity9 asking for details about his time in the notorious federal penitentiary . much to @entity36 's surprise , @entity9 wrote back extensively about his fond memories of his time in @entity27 . @entity36 told @entity46 ' @entity45 that @entity9 wrote , " ' if i could choose my epitaph on my tombstone , it would be ' i 'd rather be in @entity27 . ' ' " @entity9 apparently liked @entity27 so much that he went back there as a tourist . there 's even a photo of a smiling @entity9 with his then - girlfriend @entity53 dressed in mock prison garb . 2 . volunteered for lsd testing in prison while imprisoned in @entity34 for the bank robbery conviction in 1957 , @entity9 volunteered to be a drug test subject in an effort to reduce his prison sentence . @entity9 was injected with @entity55 -- a not - so - well - known drug at the time -- for what he thought was an effort to find a cure for schizophrenia , according to @entity66 and @entity67 , authors of " @entity9 : @entity70 gangster and the manhunt that brought him to justice . " @entity9 said he suffered from lifelong insomnia and nightmares as a result of the experiment . he later learned that the experiments were actually part of the @entity81 's so - called @entity80 program to develop a mind - control weapon carried out at dozens of universities and institutions from 1953 to 1967 , according to @entity85 , author of " @entity86 , " citing two of @entity9 's associates . " ( @entity9 ) was enraged to learn how the covert program had destroyed so many lives , " @entity85 wrote in @entity89 . " according to ( @entity9 's associate @entity66 ) weeks , @entity9 had even taken preliminary steps to track down the overseer of the program , dr. @entity95 ... and assassinate him , " @entity85 wrote . 3 . only known son died at age 6 @entity9 and girlfriend @entity98 had been dating only a few months in 1966 when @entity98 became pregnant . @entity9 was n't pleased , so when the baby was born in may 1967 , @entity98 listed her ex-boyfriend as the boy 's father on the birth certificate . speaking publicly for the first time in 2010 , @entity98 told the @entity105 that @entity9 also kept his son 's identity a secret to protect him from his father 's numerous enemies . despite his initial reluctance toward fatherhood , @entity98 said @entity9 doted on the boy . " he helped pay for child care and showered @entity115 with toys , " wrote the @entity105 's @entity66 and @entity67 . as @entity9 rose through the ranks of @entity5 's @entity118 in 1973 , 6 - year - old @entity115 fell ill and was hospitalized with @entity119 , a severe reaction to aspirin . @entity9 sat by his side for three days , wrote @entity66 and @entity67 . " when he died , @entity125 ( @entity9 ) was out of his mind , " @entity98 is quoted as saying in @entity123 and @entity67 's book . 4 . he was honorably discharged from the military despite arrests @entity9 served nearly four years in the @entity129 , working as an aircraft mechanic and earning his high school diploma . yet the future gang leader never strayed far from trouble . during his military service , the young @entity9 was arrested for going @entity135 and , in a separate incident , police arrested him on rape charges . he was never convicted or sentenced on either charge and received an honorable discharge in 1952 . 5 . he hated the nickname ' @entity9 ' nearly every mobster has a colorful nickname , but family and associates say @entity9 hated " @entity9 , " a reference to his white - blond hair as a child . he preferred his real name , @entity150 , and reportedly he was also ok with the moniker " boots , " which referred to his fondness for cowboy boots . 6 . you can apparently rent his old apartment during the time that @entity9 spent eluding authorities , he and girlfriend @entity157 lived as @entity160 and @entity161 in a seaside apartment in @entity163 , @entity164 . in his letters to @entity36 , @entity9 described that time as " a 16 - year honeymoon .

@placeholder will host live web chat during the show	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- there 's still time to charge that laptop and brew some coffee before the @entity5 meteor shower peaks predawn friday . ok , it 's easy to understand why the coffee will come in handy during the long watch overnight . but the laptop ? meteor gazers can join a @entity12 live chat with astronomer @entity13 . the @entity15 astronomer will answer questions beginning around 11 p.m. eastern time thursday . @entity12 also is broadcasting live the hums of the meteors as they whiz by . with a waxing crescent moon expected to set beforehand , and hence less moonlight in the way , forecasters are expecting one of the best celestial shows of the year , weather in your neighborhood permitting . with good viewing conditions , stargazers might be able to catch at least 40 meteors per hour , @entity29 said . " the august @entity5 are among the strongest of the readily observed annual meteor showers , and at maximum activity nominally yields 90 to 100 meteors per hour , " @entity29 columnist @entity33 said in his column . " anyone in a city or near bright suburban lights will see far fewer . " @entity12 advises viewers that " the @entity5 shower will begin around 10 p.m. your local time . however , the best times to view are after midnight and before dawn , with the best activity around 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. local time . best conditions are a clear , dark sky away from city lights . go outside and look straight up at the sky . " the @entity5 can be seen all over the sky , but the best viewing opportunities will be across the @entity54 . those with sharp eyes will see that the meteors radiate from the direction of the constellation @entity59 . the @entity5 have been observed for at least 2,000 years and are associated with the comet @entity61 , which orbits the sun once every 133 years , @entity12 says . each year in august , the @entity63 passes through a cloud of the comet 's debris . these bits of ice and dust burn up in the @entity63 's atmosphere to create one of the best meteor showers of the year .	@entity15:Marshall Space Flight Center	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Bill Cooke	@entity12:NASA	@entity5:Perseids	@entity29:Space.com	@entity33:Joe Rao	@entity54:Northern Hemisphere	@entity59:Perseus	@entity63:Earth	@entity61:Swift-Tuttle
@placeholder , with a population of about 20,000 , is a quiet residential enclave	@entity85	( @entity0 ) -- the peace of mind @entity2 sought for herself and her children when she left @entity5 nearly two decades ago was shattered outside @entity6 on wednesday morning . " it was total chaos , " @entity2 said . " the kids were n't sure if they were supposed to stay in school or leave . they were n't letting anybody in and told us to stay back . there were ambulances running past us . i was able to see a lot of the parents that i know who have children in the high school . " the middle school sits across a field from the @entity25 high school where a stabbing spree injured 21 people , authorities said . a suspect , 16 - year - old sophomore @entity28 , was taken into custody and arraigned wednesday afternoon on charges of attempted homicide . speaking at a news conference wednesday afternoon , @entity33 said that before authorities arrived assistant principal @entity35 was " very admirable " in tackling the suspect and holding him for authorities with the help of another assistant principal , @entity40 . gov. @entity41 told reporters that there were " a number of heroes in this day " and " many of them are students " who stayed behind to help injured classmates . he said teachers , cafeteria workers , other staff members and school police officer @entity53 -- who was injured but who handcuffed the suspect -- ensured that others made it out safely . " this is obviously a very difficult day for this community , " the governor said . @entity2 , who has three children in the high school in addition to one in the middle school , was not surprised @entity35 was being praised for tackling the suspect . " he 's just a wonderful man , " she said . " he would do anything for your child . he would make sure he would get in touch with you if there were issues . he was very conscientious of what was happening within the friendships that they had . just an all - around great guy . " she added , " he would have done it for a stranger or a student or parent . but he was all about the kids so i am not surprised at all that he did try to get involved in stopping this . " @entity85 , with a population of about 20,000 , is a quiet middle - class enclave roughly 20 miles east of @entity5 on @entity87 . " it was very shocking , " said @entity2 , who has lived in @entity85 19 years . " we are a tight - knit community . everybody knows everybody . even the doctor attending at the closest hospital is a neighbor of ours . dr. ( @entity96 ) @entity95 , he knows these children . watching him , it touches home . " as she spoke on the phone to @entity0 , she said @entity95 , chief medical officer at @entity102 in nearby @entity103 , was live on the television news , talking about the victims and stressing " the critical nature of their injuries . " " we are so small compared to other communities , " @entity2 said . " we know each other . for myself , coming from the city of @entity5 , i came out here purposely to raise my children in a school district that we felt was safe as well as academically sound . it 's a lot to take in right now . " at @entity118 in @entity85 , @entity119 , a 1990 graduate of @entity121 , said some parents were having breakfast after dropping off their children at school . " they just kind of hung out until they got a hold of their children and made sure they were ok , " she said . " they had instructions not to go to the school . you could see the tension on their faces as they waited . " a message on the @entity6 's website said all of its elementary schools were closed after the incident , and " the middle school and high school students are secure . " @entity121 will be closed " over the next several days , " district superintendent @entity146 said . the district 's middle school and elementary schools will be open thursday , and counseling will be available for the whole district , he said . @entity2 said she was running late getting her 13 - year - old daughter to the middle school wednesday morning . by the time they arrived , they had heard about the stabbings on the news . " she did n't believe it , " @entity2 said of her daughter . " she wanted to get down there as soon as possible . once we got there , not knowing if her friends were ok , she started getting emotional . " three of @entity2 's four children attended @entity121 , she said . one of her daughters graduated last year and is now a freshman at @entity170 . " you see stuff like this all the time on the news , but you do n't know the people , " she said . " here , we know quite a few of the families of the injured students . " at the @entity181 , @entity180 cried when she heard about what happened at the school attended by her nephews and nieces . she said she later learned that they were fine . " it 's heartbreaking , " she said . " it 's a nice community . the people are very friendly and hard - working . it 's so sad for everyone involved . something has been taken away forever in your safe community . you see these kids , and you know they 're hurt and they 'll probably have lifelong pain from this .

" today is our time , " one woman tells @placeholder	@entity2	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation friday evening , moments after it was announced that @entity0 president @entity9 was stepping aside . protesters swarmed army tanks that had been deployed to keep order , banged drums , blew whistles and frantically waved @entity0 flags in celebration . they danced in circles and chanted . processions of cars made their way down city streets , drivers honking horns and waving flags . fireworks erupted outside the presidential palace in @entity1 and in the streets of @entity27 . some men and women dropped to their knees and began to pray . " i did not believe it at first , " @entity0 - @entity34 @entity33 . " i feel complete joy . " " @entity37 ! " crowds chanted outside the white carved walls of the presidential palace . " @entity40 is great ! " they shouted in @entity41 . on the front lines of the movement , protester and actor @entity45 , best known for his role in " @entity47 , " expressed complete shock at @entity9 's decision to step down , but said @entity0 now feel like " destiny is in their hands , " and he praised supporters of their struggle . " thank you to everyone who has stood in solidarity with us , " @entity45 told @entity2 's @entity55 . he said @entity0 are grateful for those who " told our true story . " @entity45 recounted seeing and hearing the voices of children . " hold your head high , " @entity45 said they chanted , " you 're an @entity0 . " fears that the @entity68 , an @entity69 umbrella group , could hijack @entity0 's pro-democracy movement have made headlines during the 18 days of protests in the country , but the group has stated more than once that they are not seeking power . on friday , they celebrated the news of @entity9 's departure with the rest of the @entity0 . " we are opening a new bridge now on history , " @entity68 spokesman @entity81 told @entity2 . " this is [ a ] critical moment . " @entity81 said of the pro-democracy revolution that he said he believes will shape the future of @entity0 . in @entity27 , @entity88 , an @entity34 living with her @entity0 husband , @entity90 , said she was watching @entity0 state tv when news of @entity9 's resignation was announced . " we could hear people , even before the end of the statement i heard people outside of the window shouting and honking their horns , " she said . @entity101 of @entity1 said he felt like he played a role in forcing @entity9 to resign by taking part in demonstrations . " everyone is very happy . no one imagined this day would come , " he said . " i 've never been prouder to be an @entity0 . " two of the main bridges connecting east and west @entity1 were like parking lots as people got out and began hugging and dancing . " life is great now . i think i will have a much better future now . it is a different era , " a 17 - year - old girl named @entity88 told @entity2 . the news of @entity9 's resignation , and the revolution that led to the announcement , has also sparked a renewed spirit and proud voice for @entity0 . " i stopped writing -- as a journalist -- because i felt there was nothing to write about , " said @entity122 , a 76 - year - old retiree . " but i feel now that the pyramid of corruption has fallen . i want to go back to writing now ! " one of the movement 's key activists , @entity130 , credited ordinary @entity0 for persisting through historic and sometimes violent protests that led to the first ouster of an @entity0 leader since 1952 . " congratulations @entity0 the criminal has left the palace , " said @entity130 , who was jailed for a week and a half by the @entity9 regime and whose emotional commentary after his release helped galvanize protesters . addressing @entity9 and his allies , @entity130 said the country should hold them accountable for their actions , including the deaths of protesters killed during what had been peaceful demonstrations . " i just want to say to @entity9 and to @entity149 and to all those people who thought that being in power means you can oppress people , you know , hard - luck guys , you know , at the end of the day , we have a choice and we 've made our choice , " he said . " they convinced us for 30 years that @entity0 had died , that there was no more @entity0 , " he said in an interview with @entity2 , referring to the nearly 30 years of autocratic rule under @entity9 . " we were all looking for @entity0 and thank @entity40 we found her today . " @entity130 , who helped set up the initial @entity168 page calling for protests , said it was time to celebrate , and said he has confidence that @entity0 will not fall into dictatorship again . " today , i am telling you @entity0 is going to be a democratic state , " said @entity130 , who is on leave of absence from his job at @entity176 . @entity179 , a leading opposition figure , showed his support for @entity9 's decision to step down through @entity182 . " @entity183 is a free and proud nation . @entity186 , " was posted by @entity179 friday night on the social media website . @entity187 , secretary general of @entity188 , said he is optimistic that the country is on the right path .

" we have learned that it is not too difficult to change . sadly , some people died on the way . " @entity0 's ambassador to the @entity34 spoke with @entity2 friday about the what it will take to form a new democratic government and whether future elections will be fair and open .

experts in ballistics , pathology and psychiatry will try to support @placeholder ' story	@entity1	the trial of @entity1 , accused of killing his former girlfriend @entity2 , was postponed until april 7 because one of two assessors was hospitalized . the assessors will help the judge decide the verdict . @entity8 does not have jury trials . @entity1 killed @entity2 on @entity10 last year . of that , there is no doubt . but was it murder ? one of @entity8 's toughest prosecutors , @entity16 , has been fighting for most of this month to prove it was . on friday , one of the country 's shrewdest defense lawyers , @entity21 , was scheduled to begin convincing a judge that it was n't . now he will have to wait . the verdict will hinge on two questions : did the @entity27 sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow - point bullets through it in the middle of the night ? and if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar , as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have ? critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time , the " @entity1 " himself . @entity1 was expected to take the stand for the first time friday to give his side of a story he 's been telling for more than a year . he woke up in the middle of the night , went to his balcony to bring in a fan -- or two fans , in his most recent version -- heard his bathroom window opening , took his gun , went to the bathroom and fired through the door when he heard a noise in the toilet . " it was pitch dark in the bedroom , and i thought @entity2 was in bed , " he testified when he applied for bail in the days after the killing . in that version of the story , @entity1 emphasized that he " felt a sense of terror " when he heard the noise , that he " felt extremely vulnerable " because he was not wearing his prosthetic legs , and that he " has been a victim of violence and of burglaries before . " and , he said , " we were deeply in love and i could not be happier . " if judge @entity70 believes that story , @entity1 could be acquitted of murder . she could find him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide -- similar to what would be called manslaughter in the @entity76 -- or find him not guilty at all . the defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support @entity1 ' story : ballistics @entity1 fired four shots . three hit @entity2 : one in the hip , one in the arm and one in the head . the shot to the head probably killed her almost instantly . but when did that shot hit her ? the prosecution says it hit her last . that means she would have been able to scream between shots -- potentially giving @entity1 a moment to realize his mistake and stop shooting . defense lawyer @entity21 rejected the prosecution 's order of shots , though , in a heated exchange with police capt. @entity98 , the prosecution ballistics expert . @entity21 said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different , and that @entity1 fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two " double taps . " @entity98 said it was " impossible " for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps , ultimately leaving @entity21 sighing dismissively and promising that his own ballistics expert would explain . pathology @entity1 threw up repeatedly as @entity112 , who performed the autopsy on @entity2 , described the devastating wounds @entity1 inflicted on her . but as gruesome as the testimony was , it is not critical to the state 's case -- there 's no doubt , after all , who killed @entity2 or how . the most damning thing @entity112 said was far less dramatic . based on the contents of her stomach , the pathologist suggested that @entity2 had probably eaten around 1 a.m. , about two hours before she died . that 's a direct contradiction of @entity1 ' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m. , her doing yoga and him watching television , and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga . @entity21 hammered @entity112 on the question of when @entity2 last ate , going so far as to bring in academic articles for the pathologist to read , a clear sign that the defense considers it crucial to rebut that point . @entity112 did not budge . a pathologist who attended the autopsy on behalf of @entity1 , @entity143 , is due to testify for the defense . a police cell phone expert also may have found a similar inconsistency with @entity1 ' timeline . capt. @entity148 , who downloaded the contents of @entity150 , said it made an internet connection for about five minutes an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting . the defense may put forward an expert of their own to explain . psychiatry @entity1 needs the judge to believe not only that there is a chance he made a genuine mistake in thinking @entity2 was a burglar , but that his response was reasonable . @entity164 , a gun dealer who was selling a small arsenal to @entity1 at the time of the killing , testified that the athlete had passed a test showing he knew what the law said about firing in self - defense . on the face of it , what @entity1 did in firing through a closed door , when he could not see an imminent threat , was neither legal nor safe , the @entity174 testimony suggested . but a psychiatrist may argue that @entity1 should be judged by a different standard of reasonableness because he is a double amputee who was not wearing his prosthetics at the time . his statement at his bail hearing implied that he should : " as i did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable , i knew i had to protect @entity2 and myself . ... i felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and i have limited mobility on my stumps . " if the judge accepts that as true , @entity1 ' disability could prove to be his greatest defense .	@entity2:Reeva Steenkamp	@entity1:Pistorius	@entity21:Roux	@entity27:Olympic	@entity164:Sean Rens	@entity16:Gerrie Nel	@entity8:South Africa	@entity148:Francois Moller	@entity76:United States	@entity10:Valentine 's Day	@entity112:Saayman	@entity98:Mangena	@entity143:Reggie Perumal	@entity150:Pistorius ' iPhone	@entity70:Thokozile Matilda Masipa	@entity174:Rens
@placeholder says it launched a military campaign to dislodge @entity53 separatists	@entity5	@entity1 security forces battled pro-russian militants in the eastern flashpoint city of @entity4 on monday as @entity5 tackled the gunmen who have overrun the region . military gains were evident on the main highway into @entity4 , a rebel stronghold , as government forces moved in . a @entity12 team on the ground saw a substantial number of militants bolster their defensive positions and checkpoints inside the city . one civilian car was hit in the fighting , its exterior damaged by bullet holes . at a local hospital , the @entity12 team saw several people injured from the heavy clashes . one woman had been shot in the head , probably in a crossfire , and two pro-russian militants were also brought in . @entity1 's @entity31 said four people were killed and nearly 30 injured in the city . it quoted local residents as saying the attackers had shot at residential buildings and set them on fire . militants blamed @entity1 forces for the civilian casualties . in a separate statement , the @entity42 said a military helicopter was shot down " during a combat mission and patrolling in the area " of @entity4 on monday , but the pilots survived after it crashed into a river . they were later rescued . @entity1 's embattled new leaders have launched their most intensive effort yet to dislodge @entity53 separatists who have reportedly seized government buildings in nearly a dozen cities and towns . @entity5 authorities describe the separatists as " terrorists . " but the rebels say they are defending @entity62 - speaking areas of the east against @entity1 " fascists " trying to root out @entity62 influence in the country . in a statement monday , @entity62 's @entity67 accused the @entity5 government of " continuing a war against the people of their own country . " " we again urge the @entity5 organizers of terror against their own people to come to their senses , stop the bloodshed , withdraw troops and sit down , finally , at the negotiating table to start a normal dialogue on ways to resolve the political crisis , " the ministry said . many experts say @entity62 may be provoking unrest in eastern @entity1 to justify an incursion . riot - hit @entity88 the uprisings began when president @entity90 , a supporter of closer ties with @entity92 , was toppled by demonstrations led by @entity95 figures in february , namely in @entity5 , the capital . violence soon erupted in the east and south of the country , escalating dramatically last week . on sunday , @entity53 sympathizers smashed their way into a police station in the @entity104 port city of @entity88 , demanding their detained comrades be released . in another victory for a violent crowd in east @entity1 and yet another humiliation for state authorities , police did n't try to stop them . instead , they offered the crowd a deal , releasing 67 alleged enemies of the state if the furious crowd went home . sunday 's storming of the @entity88 police station -- just two days after more than 40 people were killed in a street battle and deadly blaze in the city -- was one more example of how @entity1 's new @entity95 - backed leaders are struggling to maintain law and order in the south and east of the country . it also raises questions about the ability of the army and police to confront an uprising that @entity5 says is backed by @entity92 -- an accusation the @entity138 denies . the men released sunday had been detained over the weekend after bloody clashes between supporters and opponents of @entity62 in @entity88 on friday , which ended in the deadly blaze . forty - six people were killed in the bloodshed -- the deadliest since @entity90 was ousted . @entity146 posted on @entity147 appeared to show supporters of @entity5 's government throwing @entity151 cocktails at the building where pro-russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions . the footage , which @entity12 could not independently confirm , showed people sitting on ledges trying to escape the fire and thick smoke . in an attempt to reassert @entity5 's authority , @entity1 interim prime minister @entity160 went to @entity88 to appeal for unity while accusing @entity62 of provoking the clashes . @entity1 's @entity165 said it would offer financial assistance to the victims ' families . " this is the wake - up call for the entire country , for reconciliation . we need to realize that @entity62 want to eliminate our country , " @entity160 said . his message is a tough sell in a city where so many now believe people who speak @entity62 are being killed and arrested by forces loyal to the @entity1 government . military action @entity1 's government reported some progress over the weekend in its military campaign . officials said security forces had regained control of a tv tower in @entity188 , some 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) south of @entity4 . residents in @entity188 reported hearing gunfire and a @entity12 team on the outskirts of @entity188 saw troop carriers moving toward the city center saturday . amateur video posted online -- the authenticity of which could not be confirmed by @entity12 -- showed burned buses , plumes of smoke and residents calmly observing it all . saturday actually featured a rare bright spot in the volatility : the release of seven international military observers and five @entity1 from the @entity209 who had been held hostage for eight days in @entity4 . however , in another challenge to @entity5 , separatist leader @entity212 in @entity213 declared a state of emergency and announced the formation of a " @entity219 " army for the entire region . in a video statement aired on local stations , @entity212 introduced a curfew , a ban on political parties and his expectation that local law enforcement officials will take an oath of allegiance to the people of @entity213 . in @entity231 , separatists say they are preparing their own referendum on may 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from @entity1 -- an echo of events that led to @entity92 wresting @entity237 from @entity5 . @entity238 , the self - declared chairman of the @entity239 , told @entity12 the question on the ballot paper would read : " do you support the act of state sovereignty of the @entity248 ? " to which voters can respond with " yes " or " no. " he said enough ballot papers had already been printed to hold the vote . tensions with @entity62 separatists -- many of them of @entity62 descent -- say they believe the government in @entity5 is illegitimate because it formed after what they call the illegal ousting of @entity90 in february . officials in @entity5 accuse @entity92 of meddling by supporting the separatists . @entity259 has estimated that up to 40,000 @entity62 troops are now near the border with @entity1 , which has made @entity5 's government and neighboring nations wary of invasion . a senior @entity266 official told @entity12 on monday that the latest intelligence still showed 40,000 to 50,000 @entity62 troops on the border . " there has been no major change in force disposition or readiness and no indications of preparations for an invasion , " the official said , adding that the @entity266 continues to assess the situation . the troops are so close to the border , an invasion could happen with little or no warning , the official said . @entity62 and the @entity280 squared off diplomatically over the fate of @entity1 when @entity92 annexed the @entity104 peninsula of @entity237 in march after a hastily called referendum and @entity90 's ouster . he was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from @entity290 in favor of @entity92 . @entity293 foreign minister @entity292 warned monday there could be fresh sanctions on @entity62 if @entity1 's presidential elections do not take place on may 25 . @entity62 has condemned @entity5 's military action in the volatile east . @entity300 , @entity62 president @entity301 's spokesman , said @entity62 's government had received thousands of calls since friday from people in southeastern @entity1 . the callers described the situation as " horrendous " and pleaded for @entity62 's involvement .

@placeholder scores goal of the tournament	@entity93	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 has provided an all you can eat buffet when it comes to goals -- but in a tournament which constantly manages to amaze , the latest item on the menu in @entity9 was akin to a feast . those fortunate enough to witness this enthralling contest between the attacking talent of the @entity13 and the never - say - die attitude of the @entity15 were arguably treated to the game of the tournament so far . the @entity19 , which had trailed 2 - 1 after @entity21 's penalty had given @entity23 shock 54th minute lead , eventually prevailed 3 - 2 in a pulsating and often breathtaking affair . @entity27 @entity26 was the hero for the @entity13 , becoming his country 's youngest ever @entity1 scorer , lashing home the winner just 10 minutes after @entity32 had dragged his side level . last friday , @entity19 brought the tournament to life with one of the greatest results in recent @entity1 history . not only did it defeat the reigning champion , it dragged it off its throne kicking and screaming while @entity44 faces were left red with humiliation . it was sweet revenge for the @entity13 , which came so close four years ago only to lose out to @entity49 's winner in @entity50 . under the guidance of coach @entity54 , who will join @entity55 after the tournament , this current crop of players has emerged as a new force on the world stage . while the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 remain , the exciting youthful talent of @entity60 and defender @entity61 represents the next generation . there were some who did n't think the @entity19 would even make it out of the group , let alone launch a @entity1 challenge . while the @entity13 should qualify comfortably from its group , it will take a huge effort to thrill as its players have in its opening two games . @entity23 , which battled gamely during its 3 - 1 defeat by @entity79 in its opening game , arrived knowing anything but a victory would make progress almost impossible . like so many of it sporting teams , @entity23 has a side which refuses to give up hope . when @entity63 ran through the heart of the @entity15 defense and fired into the bottom corner with 19 minutes played , it seemed a case of how many goals the @entity13 could rattle in . @entity23 's talisman @entity93 had other ideas . just seconds after restarting the game , @entity95 sent a pinpoint cross into the @entity13 penalty area where @entity93 met it with an unstoppable left - footed -- a goal reminiscent of @entity103 's wonder strike for the @entity19 at the 1988 @entity105 finals . @entity93 's fifth @entity1 goal - and possibly his last -- was worth the entrance fee alone . the 34 - year - old will miss his side 's final group game against @entity111 after picking up a suspension -- not that you would have known it from his performance . buoyed by the equalizer , @entity23 began to push forward and @entity116 missed a golden opportunity to put his side ahead after lashing over from 18 - yards . and when @entity119 inadvertently handled inside his own penalty area , @entity21 swept home from 12 - yards to give his side a shock lead . from thrashing the world champion 5 - 1 to trailing the lowest ranked side in the tournament , the @entity13 were rocking . @entity23 , playing with a confidence which belied its lowly ranking , appeared set to claim one of the most famous results in its history . but the @entity13 were n't done yet and four minutes later it drew level when @entity32 rifled home from just inside the penalty area . as the game moved breathlessly from one end to the other , @entity134 should have put @entity23 back in front but could only send his effort straight at the goalkeeper from close - range . it was a costly miss which as just minutes later the @entity13 moved ahead once again . @entity143 burst forward towards the penalty area and his low effort flew in off the fingertips off @entity23 goalkeeper @entity148 . there was still time for @entity150 and @entity151 to go close -- but the goals dried up -- for now anyway .	@entity23:Australia	@entity21:Jedinak	@entity26:Memphis Depay	@entity27:Substiute	@entity116:Mark Bresciano	@entity111:Spain	@entity134:Matthew Leckie	@entity151:Jermaine Lens	@entity150:Nigel de Jong	@entity119:Daryl Janmaat	@entity154:Porto Alegre	@entity1:World Cup	@entity0:CNN	@entity9:Brazil	@entity50:Johannesburg	@entity79:Chile	@entity55:Manchester United	@entity54:Louis van Gaal	@entity15:Australian	@entity32:Robin van Persie	@entity13:Dutch	@entity19:Netherlands	@entity103:Marco van Basten	@entity105:European Championship	@entity95:Ryan McGowan	@entity93:Tim Cahill	@entity143:Depay	@entity148:Matthew Ryan	@entity63:Arjen Robben	@entity44:Spanish	@entity64:Van Persie	@entity65:Wesley Sneijder	@entity49:Andres Iniesta	@entity60:Daley Blind	@entity61:Bruno Martins Indi
@entity27 : " no way would @entity14 ever be considered representative of @placeholder "	@entity22	( @entity0 ) -- while the visiting national news media focuses on the latest utterances of @entity5 presidential hopefuls in advance of the january 3 caucuses , many @entity1 have found a bone to pick with a journalism professor -- from the @entity10 , no less -- who wrote : " whether a schizophrenic , economically depressed , and some say , culturally challenged state like @entity14 should host the first grassroots referendum to determine who will be the next president is n't at issue . ... in a perfect world , no way would @entity14 ever be considered representative of @entity22 , or even a small part of it . @entity14 's not representative of much . " @entity1 are wondering what they did to incur the wrath of @entity27 , who for 20 years has taught journalism at the state 's flagship university and shared his observations in an article for the @entity34 magazine titled " observations from 20 years of @entity36 . " it may be a good thing that @entity27 , a native of @entity40 , has been away teaching this semester at the @entity41 because in trying to explain " in both a real and metaphysical way , what @entity14 is , " he has drawn the ire of @entity1 literally from all corners of the state -- from @entity47 and @entity48 ( whose mayor has invited him to visit and explain the " a depressed , crime - infested slum town " remark ) to @entity52 to @entity53 . in the interest of full disclosure , many of my childhood vacations ( including winter ) were spent visiting my mother 's parents in @entity61 . i graduated from a college in @entity61 , and my first full - time job in journalism was at a newspaper in @entity61 , so i admit to a certain fondness for the state . and every four years , as the political spotlight shines on @entity61 , i share with colleagues whatever helpful insights i can muster . @entity72 's blog : turbulence in @entity61 the state is not one large cornfield , but driving along @entity76 , it can appear that way for long stretches . visit northeast @entity61 along the @entity79 for proof that the state is not flat . @entity14 's farms not only help feed the @entity22 , but also much of the world , connecting this piece of " flyover country " to a global view . still , economists report that agriculture only accounts for roughly one in five jobs in the state . @entity1 may be older ( the average age continues to increase ) , whiter and more rural than the @entity22 in general , but its @entity93 population is increasing and more of its residents are moving to urban areas . @entity14 boasts being among the most literate states in the union ( though some years ago state officials abandoned a plan to make " @entity14 " its license plate slogan ) . politically , over the years @entity1 have elected some of the most liberal and some of the most conservative members of @entity105 . critics cite numerous examples of a snide tone in @entity27 's writing . consider his assessment of employment prospects in rural @entity61 : " those who stay in rural @entity61 are often the elderly waiting to die , those too timid ( or lacking in educated ) to peer around the bend for better opportunities , an assortment of waste - toids and meth addicts with pale skin and rotted teeth , or those who quixotically believe , like @entity122 , that the sun 'll come out tomorrow . " what makes @entity14 's @entity5 caucuses unique and while they wait for that sun to come out , @entity27 suggests , these @entity1 spend their days stepping in manure from barnyard animals and stuffing their gullets with meat loaf , pork chops and @entity132 molds before heading out to a tractor pull or church . @entity27 makes nary a mention of the distinguished academics at the state 's universities and colleges , its art museums and orchestras nor even the obvious upgrades to the capital city of @entity144 during the past 20 years . where he says that " @entity14 is a throwback to yesteryear and , at the same time , a cautionary tale of what lies around the corner , " critics find many of @entity27 's observations to be throwbacks to an @entity61 that no longer exists . many also say there are factual inaccuracies in the article . @entity157 , president of the @entity10 , which employs @entity27 , objected . " i disagree strongly with and was offended by professor @entity27 's portrayal of @entity14 and @entity1 . please know that he does not speak for the @entity10 . as president of the university , i have the opportunity to travel far and wide across this great state frequently , and the @entity14 i see is one of strong , hard - working and creative people . in this cynical world that can harden even the greatest optimist , the citizens of @entity14 continue to believe , " @entity165 responded to the @entity34 . " what defines @entity1 are their deeds and actions and not some caricature . when i travel the state , what i see is a land that is rich not only because of its soil but because of how its people are grounded . @entity1 are pragmatic and balanced , and they live within their means . this lifestyle , while not glitzy , is humble and true and can weather the most difficult of times , " @entity165 said . sports editor @entity182 of the @entity184 newspaper agreed with some parts of @entity27 's article , but suggested that " rather than having some good - natured fun with the quirks and traditions that make rural @entity61 life so unique , @entity27 's tone is condescending , apparently designed to mock rural @entity14 in front of the rest of the nation . " @entity27 , he wrote , " fails to mention one of rural @entity61 's greatest qualities , which is its ability to rise up and come together for someone in need . you have farmers completing a harvest for a neighbor , fund - raisers for families of ill or injured residents , and citizens filling sandbags to ward against an impending flood . rural iowans do these things willingly , immediately , and without question . if that 's not representative of our nation as a whole , that 's a shame . " @entity219 , who writes about life along the @entity79 , offered this scathing assessment : " @entity27 wrote a poorly reasoned article plagued by factual errors and loaded with big - city stereotypes of country folk . his essay was , ultimately , a lazy piece of incendiary rubbish , which i guess is what passes for journalism today . " @entity27 shared some of his " fan mail " with media commentator @entity234 , including this excerpt : " first i want to apologize for @entity1 who may have threatened you . i am a dental student here at the university and grew up in a small @entity61 town my whole life ( @entity240 ) before coming here . i agree that we have our problems as @entity1 but one thing we are is fiercely loyal . your article is true ( for the most part ) about rural @entity1 but anyone from here , esp us city folk , are going to be upset by that stereotype . " @entity27 defended his work in a letter to the press - citizen newspaper in @entity255 . " perhaps my article gave some @entity1 a moment to refocus their attention elsewhere -- from some of the real issues confronting the state -- @entity268 taking over the retail - trade sector , empty storefronts , water pollution among the worst in the nation , factories shutting down , the state 's brain drain , undocumented workers taking minimum - wage jobs in the state 's under - regulated slaughterhouses , not to mention the tragedy that anyone can see walking into the state 's casinos . " i 'm a proud journalist . i still believe in the adage , ' comfort the afflicted , and afflict the comfortable . ' today , much of the state is afflicted by a ravaged economy . @entity14 's population growth has flat - lined . but i guess it 's just more comforting to some @entity1 to condemn me for pointing out these issues and others . " i 'll give the last word to @entity287 , a native southerner who was editor of recently closed @entity288 . of her adopted home state , @entity287 wrote , also in the @entity34 , " it 's a way of life trying desperately to sustain itself and justify its own existence . it is battling against national stereotypes that no longer apply while facing newer and much more lethal challenges . " it 's picturesque scenes of idyllic farms and country roads glimpsed through a car window . it 's everyone believing they know who and what you are before they go fishing with you and the shirt comes off . as professor @entity27 admits in his own writings , he never took up fishing . bless his heart .

" i gave it everything i had , it was a very good race , " @entity1 , who was fastest in the earlier semifinals in 10.06 , told reporters . " i was worried at the start , but after that i ran the kind of race i normally run . i knew i had a chance of a medal , even winning gold . " @entity21 , the current world indoor 60m champion who won relay gold in @entity39 four years ago on return after his ban for drug use , put on a brave face after his disappointing finish . " i had to rely on my experience , which kept me relaxed , but it was n't enough to win . i 've just got to keep on ploughing at it until my opportunity prevails , " said the 32 - year - old , who won silver in 1998 and then had to return his gold in 2002 after being caught using steroids . @entity1 's heat featured another strong performance from @entity57 paralympian @entity56 , who is the first legally blind athlete to compete at the @entity58 . the partially - sighted 23 - year - old finished fourth in the eight - man heat in a time of 10.46 , but even his personal best of 10.32 would not have been enough to reach the final . @entity63 runner @entity62 of @entity63 won the women 's 10,000m title , finishing 12 seconds ahead of @entity67 's defending champion @entity68 , with @entity69 of @entity70 taking bronze . @entity72 won silver medals in the distance at the @entity75 and 2009 world championships . @entity67 had a clean sweep of the medals in the women 's 20 - kilometer walk , as @entity82 and world champion @entity81 went one better than her silver in 2006 . @entity84 , 21 , took the silver while @entity86 claimed bronze as the @entity67 followed up the victory of teenage compatriot @entity89 in the men 's race on tuesday . @entity93 's @entity92 claimed a shock gold in the women 's long jump , with the 29 - year - old heading off @entity70 's 2006 silver medallist @entity97 in a tie - breaker after both leaped 6.92 meters . @entity100 was third in 6.84 while her fellow @entity67 and defending champion @entity101 was back in fifth on 6.55 . former @entity82 heptathlon champion @entity102 was 11th of the 12 finalists on 6.33 . @entity105 's top - ranked @entity104 won the men 's hammer final with a best throw of 80.02 meters , while @entity110 's @entity109 claimed silver with 79.12 and bronze went to @entity114 's @entity113 ( 79.06 ) . @entity116 's 20 - year - old rising star @entity115 won the women 's discus title with a best throw of 64.67 , while @entity121 's 2006 bronze medallist @entity120 was second with 63.48 and @entity123 's @entity122 took third with 62.37 . @entity125 's @entity124 , who has thrown the furthest this year with 67.78 in may , finished back in eighth on a disappointing 57.78 .	@entity20:Mark Lewis-Francis	@entity21:Chambers	@entity24:Mbandjock	@entity25:Francis Obikwelu	@entity81:Olga Kaniskina	@entity82:Olympic	@entity114:Hungary	@entity84:Anisya Kirdyapkina	@entity86:Vera Sokolova	@entity110:Italy	@entity89:Stanislav Emelyanov	@entity2:Frenchman	@entity1:Lemaitre	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Barcelona	@entity6:European Athletics Championships	@entity93:Latvia	@entity92:Ineta Radevica	@entity57:Irish	@entity56:Jason Smyth	@entity75:2008 Olympics	@entity58:European Championships	@entity70:Portugal	@entity72:Abeylegesse	@entity14:Britain	@entity13:Dwain Chambers	@entity39:Stockholm	@entity100:Olga Kucherenko	@entity101:Lyudmila Kolchanova	@entity102:Carolina Kluft	@entity104:Libor Charfreitag	@entity105:Slovakia	@entity97:Naide Gomes	@entity109:Nicola Vizzoni	@entity124:Nadine Muller	@entity125:Germany	@entity122:Joanna Wisniewska	@entity123:Poland	@entity120:Nicoleta Grasu	@entity121:Romania	@entity116:Croatia	@entity115:Sandra Perkovic	@entity68:Inga Abitova	@entity69:Jessica Augusto	@entity67:Russian	@entity113:Krisztian Pars	@entity62:Elvan Abeylegesse	@entity63:Turkey
@entity4 scores unbeaten 103 to guide @placeholder to a five - wicket victory	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 tied the three - test series with @entity3 after @entity4 overcame back problems to score an unbeaten century on the final day of the deciding match in @entity7 to seal a five - wicket victory . set 257 to win , the top - ranked tourists made it home comfortably following a fourth - wicket partnership of 109 between @entity4 and veteran batsman @entity12 , with @entity14 's 41 off 45 balls completing a fine turnaround . @entity4 followed up his first - innings 56 as he ended the match unbeaten on 103 from 149 balls , scoring his 16th @entity20 ton despite needing the help of a runner . " he proved today why he is called very , very special , " @entity24 captain @entity23 told reporters . " he always comes up with innings that have a huge bearing on the game . " it was very important for him to score runs as the team needed it most to level the series . i think it is a very special innings . hopefully , he plays plenty more innings like this for us . " @entity4 , a veteran of 113 tests , said he had struggled to keep momentum due to his back pain . " i started my innings well , but during the partnership i had a lot of discomfort and the spasms did n't allow me to move freely . once i was into my 30s it became very painful , " he said . " it was difficult . you do n't want to create confusion and also not break the rhythm . if you see , @entity12 got out once i took the runner . but i was in such pain that i thought that the best decision in team 's interest was to have a runner instead of just giving away the wicket due to pain . " @entity3 captain @entity61 said the turning point was when his side were bowled out for 267 in their second innings the previous day . " if we had just tried to bat till lunch , the ball would have got softer and we could have scored a lot more runs . but unfortunately , we played some poor strokes , " he said . " otherwise we could have batted out the day and put the heavy roller on today and declared . " resuming on 53 - 3 in their second innings on saturday , @entity1 soon lost nightwatchman @entity75 for four as off - spinner @entity76 claimed his fourth wicket . but @entity4 joined @entity12 , who made a patient 54 off 122 balls -- his 56th half - century in his record 169th @entity20 appearance -- before also falling to @entity76 at 171 - 5 . @entity12 had been dropped by a close fielder when on 18 also off @entity76 , who claimed his first five - wicket haul in just his second outing after coming in to replace retired world record - holder @entity85 . @entity14 , who scored 120 on debut in the previous drawn test , hit the winning runs with a six off @entity89 just before the scheduled tea break . meanwhile , @entity91 reached 19 - 1 at stumps of the second day of the second test against @entity94 , having bowled out the hosts for 251 in @entity96 . @entity91 , all out for a paltry 72 in their first innings , are still 160 runs away from making @entity94 bat again at @entity101 . the hosts resumed on 112 - 2 on saturday , but spinner @entity103 took his first five - wicket haul to restrict the deficit . however , @entity91 's bowling options were hit when seamer @entity107 was ruled out of the rest of the match with a torn hamstring . @entity111 returned to form with 80 , but had a lucky escape on 41 when he was given not out in bizarre circumstances . the @entity115 - born batsman pulled away from the crease just before @entity117 was about to deliver the ball , signaling he had been distracted by movement behind the bowler . but then he offered a shot after all and chipped a catch to @entity91 captain @entity123 , who could not persuade umpire @entity124 to change his decision of " dead ball .

study : 65 % of forest elephants in @placeholder were lost to poaching from 2002 to 2013	@entity10	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 's prince @entity2 made a heartfelt appeal thursday for the world to come together to end the " appalling trade " annihilating threatened wildlife such as elephants and tigers in @entity10 and @entity11 . his speech at the @entity13 on the @entity14 called for high - level action by world leaders to be matched by action on the ground to stop the demand for illegal products and punish those involved in the trade . the conference was the culmination of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones , hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of @entity11 . in a declaration agreed to at the end of the summit , leaders pledged to strengthen enforcement to protect animals at risk of poaching , to impose tougher sanctions on all those involved in the illegal wildlife trade , and to address related corruption and bribery . they also agreed to destroy stockpiles of seized wildlife products -- an issue which has been contentious in the past . prince @entity2 in his speech praised the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 for having recently destroyed substantial stockpiles of seized ivory . @entity55 , chief conservationist for the @entity56 , welcomed the declaration , saying it " sends a strong message across the globe : wildlife trafficking is a serious crime , on a global scale , and must be tackled at all levels as a matter of urgency . " the declaration calls for a global crackdown on wildlife crime and on the corruption and organized criminal activities that feed it . " forest elephants decimated the conference was held as new figures from the @entity75 - based @entity56 revealed that a massive 65 % of forest elephants in @entity10 were lost to poaching between 2002 and 2013 . based on research across 80 sites in five countries , a study shows that forest elephants are being killed for their ivory at " a shocking 9 % per year , " the conservation group said . as a result , they occupy only about a quarter of the area they once roamed -- with the forests of the huge @entity89 notably almost empty of elephants . researcher @entity91 , a co-author of the study , said that at least 200,000 forest elephants were lost between 2002 and 2013 , " to the tune of at least 60 a day , or one every 20 minutes , day and night . " she added , " by the time you eat breakfast , another elephant has been slaughtered to produce trinkets for the ivory market . " prince : dire situation in @entity10 @entity2 said he had been approached a little over a year ago by a group of presidents from @entity10 who made an impassioned plea for help . " the situation they described was indeed dire , " he said . " the scale of the poaching crisis their countries were facing had reached unimaginable heights . organized gangs , terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns . " now , the forests and savannahs are " frighteningly silent , " he said , and without elephants to aid in seed germination , the long - term ecology of many forests is " fatally disrupted . " the problem of poaching is not just in @entity10 , he said , since wildlife in @entity11 , particularly @entity132 , is also being decimated . the leaders gathered in @entity0 will sign a declaration that includes new pledges to tackle the demand for and consumption of illegally traded wildlife products , @entity2 said . " most recently , demand from @entity11 -- particularly @entity51 -- has fueled the trade , but we also know that the @entity50 and @entity142 are contributing to it , " he said . at the same time , he said , recent initiatives taken around the world to destroy seized ivory , curb consumption of shark fin soup and protect snow leopards showed that concerted action could work . @entity3 foreign secretary @entity151 said the issue was an unprecedented crisis that demanded a global response . " but this is not just an environmental crisis , " he said . " this is now a global criminal industry , ranked alongside drugs , arms and people trafficking . it drives corruption and insecurity , and undermines efforts to cut poverty and promote sustainable development , particularly in @entity168 countries . " @entity50 market for ivory called second biggest with the issue taking center stage , @entity50 president @entity171 signed off this week on a " @entity174 , " which sets out ways to stem the illegal trade . its stated priorities are to strengthen enforcement , reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife and work more closely with international partners . @entity50 @entity184 president @entity183 welcomed the step in a blog post wednesday , but he said the group was still working toward the prohibition of all ivory trade in the country . the @entity50 is the second largest ivory marketplace worldwide , after @entity51 , he said , in part because it 's still legal to trade in " antique " ivory more than 100 years old and non-elephant ivory , such as mammoth ivory . " traffickers claim that ivory from recently poached elephants is antique , and they dye it to make it look old and forge documents to substantiate their claim . or they traffic elephant ivory as ' mammoth ivory ' or some other ivory - bearing species because those are not protected by law , " he wrote . it 's almost impossible for members of the public or enforcement officers to tell the old from the new , @entity183 said , which " adds up to a robust legal and illegal trade of ivory " in the @entity50 , particularly in @entity217 . " it 's just not worth putting elephants at risk in order to preserve a limited trade in antique ivory or ivory imported before certain dates , " he said . " people can live without it , and we know that even a modest amount of trade is likely to lead to widespread killing of elephants .

petition seeks pardon for @placeholder witches hundreds of years after their deaths	@entity5	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- campaigners in @entity1 planned to petition the @entity5 government friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries . witchcraft has not been punishable by death for nearly 300 years . they said @entity13 is a good time to highlight the " grave miscarriage of justice " suffered by the men and women falsely accused of being witches . their petition asks justice minister @entity21 to recommend that @entity22 issue a pardon . " we felt that it was time that the sinister associations held by a minority of people regarding witches and @entity13 were tackled head - on , " said @entity24 , head of @entity25 , a large costume supplier in @entity1 . " we were gobsmacked to discover that though the law was changed hundreds of years ago and society had moved on , the victims were never officially pardoned . " @entity25 launched a web site , @entity38 , to solicit signatures for their petition . they had between 150 and 200 by friday morning , @entity25 spokesman @entity40 said , but they hoped @entity13 publicity would generate more . around 400 people were executed in @entity0 and some 4,000 in @entity44 for alleged witchcraft , campaigners say . the @entity46 put an end to trials of accused witches , but many still faced persecution and jail for other crimes such as fraud . " it shifted from a spiritual thing to more of a criminal thing , " @entity40 said , but " it did n't pardon those people who 'd suffered before . " the campaigners worked with witchcraft historian @entity60 to detail eight cases they hope will persuade the government to act . they include the case of @entity64 , a woman who offered cures in @entity66 , @entity0 in the 1500s . the uneven results of her work prompted accusations of witchcraft and she was hanged in 1582 . a century later , @entity74 and @entity75 were begging for food in @entity77 , @entity0 , when a local woman blamed one of them for an illness and they were jailed . a jail visitor noticed @entity75 ' shaky hands and suggested she was " tormenting someone . " it started a string of rumors that resulted in an accusation of witchcraft , and the women were executed in 1682 . in 1645 , clergyman @entity91 was regarded as too attached to @entity92 in a strongly @entity94 area . he had already defended himself once against witchcraft when he came to the attention of a notorious zealot named @entity98 . @entity98 made @entity91 walk for days and nights until he was unable to resistconfessing to being a witch . @entity91 was hanged in @entity101 , @entity0 , after conducting his own funeral . " today we are well aware that these individuals were neither capable of harmful magic nor in league with the devil , " @entity60 said . he said the endemic poverty of the 16th to 18th centuries put pressure on leaders and the judiciary to blame someone for society 's problems -- so they decided to blame witches . " a lot of these cases were score - settling in local communities , " @entity40 said , adding many cases of alleged witchcraft were n't even reported . " the notion that people could suspend their disbelief and believe that women were talking to toads -- just horrible times . horrible times . " in 2004 , one @entity44 town managed to get a pardon for the 81 accused witches that had been put to death there . the independent baron court in @entity134 , near @entity135 , pardoned them before the court was officially disbanded in november of that year . in its ruling , the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who , it said , were executed for " conjuration or sorcery . " it said their convictions were based on insufficient evidence that often relied on " voices " or the actions of " spirits " to attest to their guilt . a separate group petitioned the @entity44 parliament last month , asking for pardons for each of the 4,000 witches who were put to death across the nation . @entity158 , a medium with @entity160 , acknowledged it 's unlikely they will get a pardon for every accused witch , so the group is going ahead with a private memorial in @entity44 instead . " it would be an apology to all those accused , " said @entity158 , whose group investigates the paranormal . @entity40 said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution , their stories still generate suspicion and stigma . that extends to modern - day criticism of children dressing as witches at @entity13 with the idea that it 's evil or connected to the devil , he said . " witches were not emissaries of @entity187 , " @entity40 said . " they were in fact persecuted women and men who deserve a pardon . " a spokesman for the @entity193 would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare . " to receive a royal pardon , the test is a high one , " the spokesman said . " evidence must prove conclusively that no offense was committed or that the applicant did not commit the offense . it is not enough that the conviction may be unsafe -- the applicant must be technically and morally innocent . " accused witches were also tried and put to death in the famous salem witch trials in the @entity212 state of @entity213 in the late 1600s , but all were later pardoned , said @entity215 , director of education at the @entity216 . the names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government , @entity215 said . gov. @entity220 cleared one name in 1957 , and then - gov. @entity222 cleared the remaining five in 2001 , she said . " their names are now on a list that makes it seem as though they were innocent , which they surely were , " @entity215 said .	@entity22:Queen Elizabeth II	@entity21:Jack Straw	@entity24:Emma Angel	@entity25:Angels	@entity158:Irvine	@entity135:Edinburgh	@entity134:Prestonpans	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:London	@entity0:England	@entity5:UK	@entity213:Massachusetts	@entity193:Ministry of Justice	@entity75:Edwards	@entity74:Mary Trembles	@entity77:Exeter	@entity13:Halloween	@entity215:D'Amario	@entity38:pardonthewitches.com	@entity216:Salem Witch Museum	@entity101:Bury St. Edmunds	@entity98:Hopkins	@entity94:Reformed	@entity92:Catholicism	@entity91:Lowes	@entity220:Foster Furcolo	@entity160:Full Moon Investigations	@entity222:Jane Swift	@entity212:U.S.	@entity187:Satan	@entity44:Scottish	@entity46:Witchcraft Act of 1735	@entity40:Webb	@entity66:Essex	@entity64:Ursula Kemp	@entity60:Callow
@entity0 hero @placeholder and his @entity8 provide free help after natural disasters	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- a powerful tornado ripped through @entity2 , @entity3 , last week , making the quaint community look like " a war zone , " according to the state 's governor . fortunately , the @entity8 was there to help . founded by 2008 @entity12 @entity11 , the organization brought its specialized fleet of disaster recovery equipment to @entity2 . since 2007 , the @entity8 has crisscrossed the country , providing free aid to as many as 40 disaster sites . @entity11 recently spoke to @entity0 's @entity18 about the team 's efforts in @entity2 . @entity18 : it seems like you got here right as the storm hit . were you one of the first guys on the ground ? @entity11 : we arrived just a few hours after the storm went through this mountain community . it was very interesting trying to figure out a way in , because we have huge tractor - trailers . a lot of these mountainous roads are very windy , and there were trees down , power lines down . but we eventually found the epicenter of the city right where the tornado went through . marciano : you 've seen a lot of disasters like this . what was your first reaction ? @entity47 : the tornado that went through @entity2 was pretty unique . not only did it go directly through the heart of town and destroy all of the infrastructure that 's needed for a community to get back on their feet , but it also went through the hills where a lot of folks were in their homes . ( that ) makes it very difficult for firefighters and emergency workers to get through those windy hills and access those home sites to do search and rescue . marciano : what 's the reaction to your team when you get into town ? @entity47 : when we arrive on the scene sometimes , it is hard for these community leaders to really believe that we are here for free with all of this gear . but they quickly do realize that we are there to help and that we care . and when they see the equipment working and the light towers go up and the roads start being cleared , they begin to realize that we are good people and that we are coming with no strings attached to help them . ... they need tools and resources that they do n't have themselves . and when they see us coming in with all the equipment ... they welcome us into the community because they know they need the help . marciano : what are some key things your team does to help communities like @entity2 ? @entity47 : after a tornado of this magnitude strikes a small community like this , the priorities have to be identified . the roads need to be cleared so that emergency workers like firefighters and search - and - rescue teams can come in and find the people and extract them to safety . they need lighting so they can see . it is very easy to walk into power lines or step on nails ... so light towers are important . so , we 've cleared the roads , we 've provided the light towers . this town has a small grocery store and gas station . ... it needed power so that people could get food and water and baby food and the essentials , including gasoline so that the emergency workers can have fuel for their trucks and carry on . marciano : at what point do you decide : " ok , our work is done here . it is time to move on ? " @entity47 : the @entity8 provides a unique service . it 's that in - between phase , that gap when the storm first strikes and when traditional help arrives . our priority is that first day , that first night and that first few weeks until traditional help arrives . marciano : why do you do this ? why did you choose this road ? @entity47 : there is just something inside of me that feels compelled to help . when i am watching the news and i see those super cells go right over these small communities and heart of @entity165 , i know that people are going through some of the most traumatic times they have ever experienced in their lives , and i want to be there to help .	@entity3:Kentucky	@entity2:West Liberty	@entity0:CNN	@entity12:CNN Heroes	@entity11:Tad Agoglia	@entity165:U.S.	@entity8:First Response Team	@entity18:Rob Marciano	@entity47:Agoglia

a video of @placeholder playing piano after salvaging belongings has gone viral	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- even though rising floodwaters were wreaking havoc along @entity1 's @entity8 communities on september 12 , @entity3 and his roommate , @entity4 , felt safe in their upscale home high on a hillside adjacent to @entity11 . a mile downhill , downtown @entity0 's streets were underwater . " we thought there might be some minor flooding in the house , " said @entity3 . " we 're so high up , we thought there would be nothing to worry about up here . " the drama was just beginning . in the early morning , @entity4 heard reports that heavy rain was isolating the city of @entity23 , where his sister @entity24 lives . he decided to evacuate @entity24 ; her partner , @entity30 ; their 8 - month old daughter , @entity29 ; and two family dogs . using @entity32 maps and a familiarity that came from riding mountain bikes in the area , @entity4 told @entity24 , who was reachable only via e-mail , that if she could hike over a ridge behind her home , they could meet at a rock quarry . flood death toll rises to seven " i zigzagged farm roads and dirt roads and found my way to the quarry , where i waited for them , quite anxiously of course . " @entity4 said . they eventually found one another , and the four , along with the dogs , crossed overflowing drainage channels and steep terrain to reach @entity4 's truck . a soggy , cold but happy @entity4 drove his extended family back to @entity0 . but not all was well . after the rescue , @entity4 and @entity3 worried that their own home was in danger . @entity3 had to strip down and dive into neck - deep water to unblock a drain filled with mud and debris . @entity4 went outside to assess rising water . " the drainage is getting higher , " he said . within minutes , their backyard filled with floodwater . " there was a 4 - foot wall of water with branches and debris in it , " said @entity4 . he ran inside and warned @entity24 , @entity30 , @entity3 and his girlfriend , @entity75 , to get out . " the latch on the door was creaking , " @entity4 said . " everything was about to give , and i knew we were going to get just hurt badly if we stayed any longer . " " it happened so quickly and suddenly , " @entity3 said . " it went from a very calm , warm and welcoming living room to a disaster in an instant . there was roaring and screaming and the sound of an immense amount of moving water and debris . " both roommates tried to hold back the @entity92 doors . " the force was overwhelming , and in the back of your head , you 're thinking of another slide could be coming down -- something that could be larger , " said @entity3 . " we just decided in that instant , just to get out , " he said . after the initial rush of water , @entity4 and @entity3 went back to collect a few treasured items . @entity104 used her phone to shoot video of the flood . " i felt a little guilty , " said @entity4 . " one minute i 'm on the highest of highs , feeling like i helped take care of my family -- the people closest to me -- and brought them to what seemed like a safe , warm place where at least we could be together . and then , moments later , i 'm walking around the hillside in the rain , with a towel on a baby , barefoot . " two other roommates were out of town during the landslide . they all returned to thick mud and ruined furniture . last saturday evening , after a grueling day salvaging belongings , an exhausted @entity125 sat down to the home 's @entity128 grand piano to play " @entity133 , " the ' 80s song by the @entity132 band @entity131 . roommate @entity134 took out her phone and recorded @entity125 ' poignant rendition .

" it 's whimsical , it 's beautiful , it 's sad , and it touches you in a lot of ways , " said @entity3 . " i think it explains this whole event . this is nature , and nature is beautiful in a lot of ways . it 's also incredibly destructive . it 's sad , and people are suffering right now . " he has been playing on and off for about 10 to 15 years and says he 's never been classically trained . @entity3 , an attorney , is modest in the limelight . he wants everyone to know that people are suffering in @entity1 , his home state , and he wants them to volunteer their time or give money to a charity like the @entity163 . " our suffering is very small compared to others in the flood " , he said . the music " put a personal face on the flood in a way that flood coverage does n't , and i think that 's why it 's resonated .

@placeholder : " @entity7 's " focus on an anti-hero challenges viewers ' normal stances	@entity229	( @entity0 ) -- now that it 's almost over , let 's remember how the whole thing started . " @entity7 " is the story of a high school chemistry teacher who found out he had lung cancer . not that there 's ever a good time for this news , but for this guy , the timing could n't have been worse : a pregnant wife , a handicapped son and financial circumstances so dire ( did i mention he was a public high school teacher ? ) that his wife and children will be impoverished when he dies . so he did exactly what you or i would do under the circumstances : get into the burgeoning market for crystal methamphetamine . among the many things you wonder : what kind of country , especially one as supposedly civilized and technologically advanced as this , would put any of its citizens in such a predicament ? and there are duly elected representatives still willing to put this country 's government into a coma until they force repeal of the relatively meager measures enacted into law to widen its citizens ' access to health care . granted this teacher 's situation is that of an imaginary character , a sad little man who becomes enlarged by the kind of situational barbarism that can rationalize anything . but long before @entity49 became a buzzword , every @entity48 could recognize this fellow 's desperate cornering as something that could happen to her or him . ah , but imagine a more libertarian sensibility making this case . while dealing crystal meth is a very bad thing , the fact that this poor sap could use his resources as a chemist to secure enough money for treatment only proves that you do n't need any government - subsidized medical care . and if the casualties of this shake - and - bake encompass dead law enforcement officers , garroted convicts , innocent passengers and crews on two commercial jets along with thousands of hapless addicts on two continents , well , these are what we call the breaks . and anyway , there are many ways for an @entity48 to exert initiative , to figure his own way out of such dilemmas that do n't involve violent death and self - destruction . at least , not necessarily . which , as everyone who 's paid close attention of " @entity7 " will tell you , sounds exactly like something @entity94 would say . no matter where you stand on health care -- or on anything else -- " @entity7 " has been able to make the ground beneath your feet softer and shakier than you think . not since " @entity100 " ( to my mind , its one true peer in this golden age for cable television series ) has there been a tv drama that watches us as intensely -- and almost as balefully -- as we watch it . remember how we were pulled every which way on how to feel about the psychologically wounded @entity110 's struggle to reconcile being both a dedicated family man and ruthless criminal entrepreneur in the thick of the turn - of - the - century economic boom ? so are we now torn between pity and scorn for the morally crippled @entity94 's fumbling and now crumbling attempts to keep everybody close to him alive , well and happy in the midst of his sordid machinations ? is his dismal negotiation of narrowing options a hint of what the " @entity127 " has in store for us ? maybe , maybe not . such a question would never occur to us if we were watching a television crime show 50 , 40 , even 30 years ago when " @entity134 " assumed credit for introducing black comedy and moral ambiguity to police melodrama . " @entity7 " has never overtly claimed to explain the way we live now . the finest works of art and literature never have to . they only connect . when we watch @entity140 ( whom i 've been proclaiming our greatest living actor since roughly the second of this show 's five seasons ) inhabit the rotting soul of @entity94 as he keeps trying to explain away everything , we are both riveted and appalled by his cluelessness , his monstrousness and his plausibility . whether it 's passively watching a junkie choking to death on her own vomit , engineering a nursing home 's explosion to eliminate a threat to his survival or manipulating his partner @entity160 ( @entity161 , who will someday revive the heroic private detective genre by himself ) away from suspecting him of attempted child murder , @entity151 is able to explain away all of it , to convince himself , if no one else ( the viewers least of all ) , that he 's doing it all to make the best out of a bad situation . call this impulse what you want , making excuses or , better still , total denial . denial is @entity151 's true addiction . more than the " crystal blue persuasion " @entity151 's been cooking or the ricin he threatens to use , denial is the toxic , satanic brew permeating " @entity7 's " narrative . deniers are worse than explainers when they facilitate or validate gruesome activities . and yet , there have been times in the five - season run of @entity7 when a small part of us rooted for @entity151 to make the best of things somehow , even in his own twisted fashion , as though we could n't quite believe or accept that anyone in his situation would submit to an alter ego as forbidding and deadly as @entity195 the @entity196 . from a safe distance , we judge him as we would any sociopath . but that 's too easy given what a complicated mess he is . and it 's the seeming normality of @entity94 that makes us interrogate ourselves more than he interrogates himself . the honest , overpowering question : how much of this jerk 's disease is carried in us ? how much are we willing to pass by or let go just to make the best of our generally imperfect lives ? i like to think i would n't go anywhere near @entity151 's dark side -- and i 'm sure most of " @entity7 's " audience feels the same way . but just as @entity110 became our perverse surrogate in lunging for the goodies of the boom years , @entity94 is the dreaded specter of the bust era , making one terrible choice after another as the legacy of dead bodies and dread excuses slowly close in on him for what promises to be a shattering revelation . no wonder we ca n't wait to see how it all comes out . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .	@entity160:Jesse	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Breaking Bad	@entity229:Gene Seymour	@entity196:Meth King	@entity195:Heisenberg	@entity110:Tony Soprano	@entity49:Obamacare	@entity100:The Sopranos	@entity161:Aaron Paul	@entity242:Seymour	@entity134:Hill Street Blues	@entity140:Bryan Cranston	@entity127:New Normal	@entity94:Walter White	@entity48:American	@entity151:Walt

@entity1 have never been past the quarterfinal stage at a @placeholder	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 is not heading to @entity2 simply to make up the numbers -- it 's looking to go all the way . that is the belief of @entity6 , who has his eyes firmly fixed on leading his side all the way to the @entity11 final . @entity1 face a challenge to get out of a tricky group , which also features @entity14 and @entity15 in addition to host and tournament favorite , @entity2 . but @entity6 insists a nation which has never gone further than the quarterfinal stage in the past can make history this time around . " our mind is on the final , really , " he told @entity0 . " i think every national team has the same possibilities to win the @entity11 . " it 's a very short competition and anything could happen , so our goal is to get into the final and to try to win it . " there 's no point going to a competition and just thinking : ' we 're just going to play three games . ' that 's not the point if you want to make history . " the striker will take heart from his side 's performance at the @entity44 after it progressed from a group which included @entity46 , @entity47 and host nation , @entity49 . the 25 - year - old scored twice in the tournament before @entity1 eventually crashed out to @entity52 with a 3 - 1 defeat in the second round . should @entity1 get that far this time around it could come up against reigning champion @entity55 or 2010 runner - up @entity57 in the last 16 . @entity6 , though , says the big boys of the tournament hold no fear for a nation competing at their sixth straight @entity11 . " if you want to win the @entity11 you need to play against the best national teams in the world . we know that if we have a very good group stage and get through , obviously the teams that we could face in the next match are going to be very difficult , " he said . " but there 's no easy national team really -- you need to play against the best . " @entity1 's most impressive @entity11 campaigns to date came in 1970 and 1986 , where they made the quarterfinal stage as the tournament 's hosts on both occasions . and @entity6 feels that with @entity2 sharing similar conditions to his country of birth , @entity1 have a better chance than many this summer . " it 's normal and it 's logical that @entity1 are going to find it a little bit easier because of the way the weather in @entity2 , " he added . " it 's quite similar to our country , and obviously for countries like @entity96 or other @entity98 countries which are colder or have a different type of weather , it 's going to be a little more difficult for them . " @entity6 joined @entity102 in 2010 after impressing as a youngster at local @entity105 side @entity104 , where he came through the youth ranks . despite enjoying initial success at @entity108 , he found life tough under manager @entity110 last season and was limited to just six @entity112 starts . but @entity6 , who has racked up 58 caps for @entity1 since making his international debut in 2009 , is determined to put a frustrating campaign behind him and get back to his best in @entity2 . " it was a very difficult year for me especially because i could n't play and i could n't help my team , " he said .

tensions flare again between @placeholder , @entity6	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- another week , another @entity2 provocation . it might seem an understandable reaction to news monday that @entity2 and @entity6 had exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border . the incident occurred a day after @entity10 had warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device , and just a week after it tested two medium - range ballistic missiles . but should the @entity13 greet such saber - rattling with a shrug of the shoulders ? after all , @entity18 capitals have been engaging in this " dance " for two decades , since the @entity20 took over as the country 's supreme leader . is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor , @entity28 , simply more of what we 've seen before ? not necessarily , argue some of those closely familiar with @entity2 . they warn that under @entity28 's rule , @entity10 has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes , whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks , the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 @entity41 and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast , or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in @entity6 should evacuate . @entity6 investigates two suspected @entity2 drones more recently , in the @entity50 intelligence community 's annual worldwide threat assessment , director of national intelligence @entity46 warned that @entity2 had " expand ( ed ) the size of its @entity53 enrichment facility and restart ( ed ) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production " but was shut down in 2007 . " the regime still acts in a very belligerent manner , but it seems less predictable , and more random , " said @entity57 , deputy envoy to @entity2 during the @entity59 administration . timeline : @entity2 nuclear program the younger @entity28 ( and young is the right word -- he is still only 31 ) took office in december 2011 , amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power , including the country 's military of more than 1 million people . since then , @entity2 has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long - range rocket in december 2012 , a move that it followed up with the country 's third nuclear test , in february 2013 . " the timing and the intensity of @entity2 's provocations ( since @entity28 took office ) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk , " said @entity80 , assistant director of the @entity6 chair at the @entity82 . " since ( @entity28 ) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces . we are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions , which is why the current situation with @entity2 is a lot more dangerous than before , " she said . but @entity103 , coordinator of the @entity104 at the @entity105 , suggested this week 's exchange of live fire is not , on its own , too troubling . " @entity2 actually warned @entity6 in advance that they were going to carry out live - fire drills in seven locations . they advised the @entity6 to remove ships from the area . all of the shells fell in the water . no land or military installations were targeted , " @entity103 said . " this is comparatively a very mild provocation . " person said the latest incidents might reflect @entity2 frustration on a number of issues , not least the recent joint military drills between @entity6 and the @entity50 , which @entity103 described as the largest such exercises in two decades . but most important , @entity103 said , is concern in @entity2 over the pace of improved relations with @entity6 and the @entity50 . all just guesswork ? of course , the most oft - stated problem with speculating on @entity2 intentions has been the claim that the information coming out of the country is just too limited to make any concrete assumptions . " there are no countries as closed as @entity2 . its citizens are n't allowed to travel , and the few @entity2 officials who do go abroad are closely watched . you basically have to go back to @entity143 's @entity142 to find something similar , " @entity57 said . " this makes it difficult to collect even the most basic background information about what is going on , and recruiting espionage sources is very difficult . the regime is very good at preventing knowledge of its inner workings . " @entity6 captures a @entity2 fishing boat a troubling glimpse of what is going on inside @entity2 came with a @entity158 report released in february . in a 372 - page report , the @entity159 on @entity2 outlined claims of " extermination , murder , enslavement , torture , imprisonment , rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation . " " the gravity , scale , duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world , " the report stated . yet understanding the inner workings of the regime has proven a tougher nut to crack . this was evident in the speculation that swirled around the younger @entity28 when it became clear he was the most likely candidate to succeed his father ; media reports were full of chatter about whether @entity28 's time at a @entity190 boarding school , and his apparent love of basketball , were an indication that he might be more friendly toward the @entity13 . @entity194 , @entity2 slam @entity158 human rights report indeed , according to a leaked cable published by @entity200 , @entity198 's intelligence community was said to have relied in part on the book of a former sushi chef for insights into the elder @entity28 's behavior . even @entity194 , the closest thing @entity2 has to a reliable ally , does n't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the @entity2 regime , suggested @entity211 , a leading @entity194 watcher and director of the @entity213 at @entity214 . the gruesome execution in december of the younger @entity28 's influential uncle , @entity218 , for example , " caught @entity215 by surprise , " @entity211 said . but @entity103 suggested the supposed impenetrability of @entity2 might sometimes be overplayed . " while @entity2 has long defied close scrutiny , there is no void of knowledge about the country . we have much more information to call upon than most care to admit , " @entity103 said , adding that the @entity105 for one has spent years " assembling and translating the diplomatic record of @entity2 's former communist allies ... ( including ) thousands of conversations between @entity2 officials , including the supreme leaders , and foreign heads of state and diplomats . " the question confronting policymakers is whether the still inexperienced @entity28 has yet mastered the implications -- and relatively safe limits -- of the brinkmanship that was practiced for so long by his father . " @entity2 is signaling that they are not shutting the door . in fact , quite the opposite is true , " @entity103 said . " but this is a very slippery slope -- and could easily turn nasty .

@placeholder drawing depicts its subject prophet wearing a bomb as a turban	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- newspapers across @entity2 wednesday reprinted the controversial cartoon of the @entity4 that sparked worldwide protests two years ago . the move came one day after @entity8 authorities arrested three people allegedly plotting a " terror - related assassination " of @entity11 , the cartoonist behind the drawing . @entity13 , was one of the newspapers involved in the republication by newspapers in @entity8 . it said : " we are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper always will defend , " in comments reported by @entity28 . newspapers in @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 also republished the drawing wednesday as part of their coverage of tuesday 's arrests . the image , by @entity39 - @entity38 cartoonist @entity11 , was one of 12 cartoons about the @entity4 originally published in september 2005 . @entity11 's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse . violent demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech . the uproar came as some @entity54 believe it is forbidden by the @entity55 to show an image of the prophet . many protesters directed their ire at @entity8 , prompting the closure of several @entity8 embassies in predominantly @entity54 countries , including @entity63 and @entity64 . there were also attacks on other diplomatic missions in @entity68 and @entity69 among others . the @entity71 has said it is keeping a watch on the situation at its embassies and has yet to report any incidents . @entity54 leaders in @entity8 wednesday attacked the republication of the cartoon , as well as the alleged murder plot , while calling for calm . @entity81 , chief of the @entity82 , told @entity28 his group was discussing whether to hold a demonstration before parliament , adding : " we are so unhappy about the cartoon being reprinted . " " no blood was ever shed in @entity8 because of this , and no blood will be shed . we are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens . let 's open a dialogue .

" thus , this morning 's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed . " @entity11 has previously said that he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror . however , many in the @entity54 world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist . " of course i fear for my life after the @entity95 informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me , " @entity11 said in a statement posted on the newspaper 's web site . " however , i have turned fear into anger and indignation . it has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which i used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness .

@entity285 's premier wine country spreads out around the city of @placeholder	@entity284	( @entity0 ) -- perhaps they 're not the first place you think of when it comes to wineries , but these four regions offer character and great wine , without the hoopla . @entity10 is set high on the bluffs overlooking the @entity12 . @entity13 , @entity14 in the mid- 90s when oenophiles started to buzz about the region 's @entity18 - style wines , there were 10 wineries in @entity13 . today , there are more than 100 , mostly accessible from @entity22 . with wine comes food , and gourmands like @entity26 and @entity27 have been pouring into town in the past decade . two years ago , @entity26 and @entity27 left their jobs as owner and chef , respectively , of an @entity34 restaurant in @entity35 , @entity14 , to open the @entity36 in the heart of @entity13 . each of the four guest rooms at their renovated @entity41 - style bungalow has a fireplace and a large tiled bathroom , and @entity27 can pack box lunches of gourmet charcuterie and cheeses , sandwiches , fruit , and dessert for picnics ( @entity51 , rooms from $ 125 , lunch $ 13 ) . @entity26 recommends enjoying them on the outdoor patio near the bocce ball courts at @entity56 , west of town on @entity22 ( @entity59 , tasting $ 5 , refundable with wine bottle purchase ) . @entity0 : see the four unexpected wine trails the highway takes you back toward downtown @entity13 , a preserved 19th - century @entity64 town , where food options range from a burrito stuffed with beef , cheese , and local sweet onions at the @entity71 truck ( 509/522 - 2866 , $ 5 ) , to @entity73 flatbread wrapped around spiced lamb and topped with yogurt sauce at @entity76 , whose chef was recently a semifinalist for a @entity80 ( @entity81 , $ 13 ) . highway 12 continues east toward @entity83 , a converted farm shed with a capital @entity85 painted on its front and a 12 - foot cement statue of the letter by the entrance . here , former band manager @entity90 blasts music by the @entity92 and the @entity93 -- both personal friends -- and serves his signature @entity95 in honor of his favorite toast : que sera ( @entity99 , tastings free , by appointment ) . -- @entity101 @entity102 , @entity103 twisting from @entity104 , @entity103 , to the @entity105 , a 16 - mile portion of @entity107 passes through the organic apple orchards , olive groves , and redwood forests of @entity102 . some of the more than 20 vineyards along the way supply pinot noir grapes for famous wineries in @entity115 and @entity116 , but you can taste similar vintages at the farm - style @entity102 wineries -- minus the popped - collar crowds . @entity122 lets babydoll sheep ( too petite to reach the fruit ) graze under the vines , and free - range chickens wander the vineyards to help keep pests under control . @entity131 tours of the grounds and tastings of the star wines -- pinot noir and dry @entity137 - style whites -- are both free ( navarrovineyards.com ) . about 10 miles northwest along the highway , gew√ºrztraminer grapes thrive in the rich soil and foggy mornings at @entity142 . longtime owners of @entity116 's @entity144 and @entity10 , @entity145 and @entity146 , acquired the rural estate last year ( @entity148 , tastings free ) . nearby , @entity149 -- the oldest in the valley , and owned by the @entity152 family -- has 10 picnic tables : some in the sun , some sheltered under vine - covered pergolas . past an arch of roses , the family pours complimentary samples of sauvignon blanc and pinot noir in a century - old redwood tasting room ( huschvineyards.com ) . like their neighbors to the north , @entity167 and @entity168 also run a vineyard and farm at @entity171 in @entity172 ( a separate wine region in the @entity102 ) . each of the two huge suites in their 6,000 - square - foot @entity178 @entity177 - style inn comes with a queen - size bed , a separate sitting room with a daybed and trundle , a full bath , and mountain views ( @entity185 , $ 150 ) . along the route , you can stop for one of 60 varieties of apples at @entity192 's @entity191 , on an orchard just north of @entity194 ( 707/895 - 3353 ) . -- @entity101 between @entity195 and @entity196 , @entity12 what the @entity197 ( hermannwinetrail.com ) lacks in size -- there are only six wineries along the 20 - mile stretch -- it makes up for in experience . the region has been producing vintages since the 1840s , before @entity115 had produced a single bottle . the captain @entity208 makes an ideal home base -- and not just because it 's in the center of @entity195 's adorable historic district . the breakfasts of upside - down apple @entity178 toast , three - cheese quiche , or baked eggs with turkey bacon and herbs are exactly what you need to prepare you for a day of sampling wines ( @entity223 , from $ 75 ) . less than a mile away , the family - run @entity224 gives free tastings in the estate 's original stone house with wood - beamed ceilings . for many of the 16 - 18 wines , you 'll get a bite of something to help you identify the flavors . a key - lime shortbread cookie brings out the fruit flavors in the vignoles , a sweet white wine , and a piece of chocolate softens the tannins in the dry @entity242 ( adampuchtawine.com ) . the picnic tables on the grounds make the perfect lunch spot , so on the way to the winery , stop at husband - and - wife - owned @entity248 to pick up some bratwurst sandwiches and one of the 15 kinds of homemade pie ( @entity254 , pie $ 3 per slice ) . two and a half miles down the road , @entity10 is set high on the bluffs overlooking the @entity12 -- one can imagine that the terrain reminded @entity259 settlers of their native @entity261 valley . tours of the 162 - year - old arched cellars , where wine is still stored , end in the tasting room , where you can try the chardonel , a dry , buttery white that 's similar to a chardonnay , and the limited - edition vintage port . next to the tasting room , @entity273 's original stable is now @entity275 , where the menu ranges from hearty @entity259 specialties like schnitzel to more refined entr√©es like filet mignon ( @entity281 , tours $ 2.50 , tastings free ) . @entity283 @entity284 , @entity285 @entity285 's premier wine country , dotted with working farms and over 1,000 acres of grape vines , spreads out around the city of @entity284 in the foothills of the @entity291 . the free tour at 20 - acre @entity293 both explores the winery and recounts the history of @entity285 wine making ( @entity297 , tasting $ 5 ) . the viognier , with aromas of honeysuckle and apricot , is an ideal refresher , and from the deck at the tasting room , visitors have a view of @entity307 and @entity309 's home , @entity310 , a mile and a half north , where a recently opened visitors center introduces guests to the founding father 's life and ideas ( @entity317 , from $ 15 ) . @entity309 's master builder also built @entity319 , a b&b just a block from the @entity322 . the decor deliberately recalls the colonial era , but the amenities -- @entity326 and flat - screen tvs -- are right up - to - date ( @entity328 , from $ 109 ) . @entity329 of @entity310 is @entity330 and @entity331 , whose @entity332 has hints of candied apple and lemon custard ( @entity337 , tasting $ 10 ) . about 18 miles west of @entity284 , in @entity339 , @entity338 occupies 15 acres on a farm where polo ponies are raised ; visitors can watch polo matches for free on sundays from @entity344 through the end of september ( @entity346 , tasting $ 5 ) . for a picnic at the vineyard , the @entity349 , a dry ros√© , pairs well with the tomato sauce on a pie from perennial favorite @entity354 . be prepared for a wait at the 32 - year - old institution ; some call this the best pizza in the state , and people come from miles around to combine toppings from the list of over 30 options , including zucchini , peanuts , and bacon ( crozetpizza.net , from $ 11.50 ) . -- @entity368 get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you @entity371 ! copyright ¬© 2009 @entity373 , all rights reserved . note : this story was accurate when it was published . please be sure to confirm all rates and details directly with the companies in question before planning your trip .	@entity349:Cros√©	@entity373:Newsweek Budget Travel , Inc.	@entity371:FREE-CLICK HERE	@entity275:Vintage Restaurant	@entity273:Stone Hill	@entity171:LindaVista Bed & Breakfast	@entity172:Yorkville	@entity177:Victorian	@entity178:French	@entity76:Saffron Mediterranean Kitchen	@entity71:Tacos La Monarca	@entity73:Turkish	@entity261:Rhine River	@entity144:Ferrari-Carano Vineyards	@entity145:Don	@entity146:Rhonda Carano	@entity307:Carters Mountain	@entity142:Lazy Creek Vineyards	@entity309:Jefferson	@entity148:lazycreekvineyards.com	@entity149:Husch Vineyards	@entity64:Western	@entity254:time4pie.com	@entity152:Oswald	@entity331:Vineyard	@entity310:Monticello	@entity317:monticello.org	@entity319:Dinsmore House	@entity131:Daily	@entity51:fatduckinn.com	@entity56:Cougar Crest Estate Winery	@entity59:cougarcrestwinery.com	@entity35:Renton	@entity34:Italian	@entity36:Fat Duck Inn	@entity242:red Norton	@entity122:Navarro Vineyards	@entity248:Time for Pie	@entity326:Wi-Fi	@entity322:University of Virginia	@entity328:dinsmorehouse.com	@entity329:South	@entity208:Wohlt Inn	@entity41:Craftsman	@entity22:Highway 12	@entity26:Palmer	@entity27:Maddrey	@entity339:Crozet	@entity338:King Family Vineyards	@entity332:2005 blanc de blanc	@entity137:Alsatian	@entity330:Kluge Estate Winery	@entity337:klugeestateonline.com	@entity14:Washington	@entity13:Walla Walla Valley	@entity12:Missouri River	@entity10:Stone Hill Winery	@entity18:Bordeaux	@entity101:Alison Rohrs	@entity102:Anderson Valley	@entity103:California	@entity104:Cloverdale	@entity105:Pacific Ocean	@entity99:kvintners.com	@entity107:Highway 128	@entity346:kingfamilyvineyards.com	@entity344:Memorial Day	@entity93:Ramones	@entity92:Raveonettes	@entity90:Charles Smith	@entity223:captainwohltinn.com	@entity224:Adam Puchta Winery	@entity81:saffronmediterraneankitchen.com	@entity185:lindavista.com	@entity80:James Beard Award	@entity116:Sonoma	@entity115:Napa	@entity83:K Vintners	@entity85:K	@entity259:German	@entity354:Crozet Pizza	@entity0:Budget Travel	@entity197:Hermann Wine Trail	@entity196:New Haven	@entity195:Hermann	@entity194:Philo	@entity192:Gowan	@entity191:Oak Tree	@entity297:jeffersonvineyards.com	@entity291:Blue Ridge Mountains	@entity293:Jefferson Vineyards	@entity95:K Syrah	@entity368:Thomas Berger	@entity167:Bob	@entity168:Linda Klein	@entity283:Beth Collins	@entity281:stonehillwinery.com	@entity285:Virginia	@entity284:Charlottesville
@placeholder provides the voice to this warrior princess ; yarn is set in @entity31	@entity48	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has an unparalleled track record when it comes to family entertainment , even if they did hit a bump with " @entity6 " last year . but like many other @entity9 studios , the company is guilty of ignoring the half of the population who are n't little boys at heart . at last , with " @entity16 , " it 's the girls ' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the @entity21 . the movie itself is no more than an agreeable lark . it 's not in the same league as " @entity27 " , " @entity29 " or the " @entity30 " films , but fun all the same . set in sunny , ancient @entity31 -- complete with warring clans , rampaging beasts , magical witches and supernatural will - o ' - the - wisps -- the movie quickly checks off the expected sightings : kilts , haggis , caber - tossing and @entity40 . @entity41 does n't make the cut , but i would n't be too surprised if she showed up in a sequel . gallery : ' @entity16 's ' @entity46 and other animated heroines @entity46 ( voiced by @entity48 ) is the eldest child to @entity50 ( @entity40 ) and @entity51 ( @entity52 ) . @entity55 , with cascading , blazing red locks , @entity46 is a tomboy . she 'd rather be riding horses , scaling cliffs or hunting with her bow and arrow than sewing , singing and accepting her mother 's mind on what behaviors befit a princess of their clan . @entity46 fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we have seen recently in warring " @entity71 " films , " @entity72 " and " @entity73 . " it 's refreshing that she 's also foolhardy and no wiser than most teenagers . mother - daughter relationships are still at a premium in big - budget flicks , and " @entity16 " observes their squabbling with an affectionate , even - handed familiarity that 's nice to see . @entity46 's independent streak stiffens to all - out rebellion when @entity51 announces it 's time to marry . as tradition demands , the groom will be the son of a neighboring chieftain , whoever emerges victorious at the forthcoming games at the gathering of the clans . but @entity46 has her own ideas about that , and storms out in search of some means to change her mum 's mind . @entity1 has played coy about what happens next . it 's the biggest and best surprise in a yarn that often feels a bit threadbare and shopworn , so we wo n't give it away here . appealing as this left - field plot twist is , it 's also daft . it 's as if @entity46 has taken a stupid pill , and the plentiful coincidences that follow are almost as hard to swallow . @entity1 likes to boast that it 's all about the story , but this tall tale has more holes than a draughty sporran . the time scale feels off , and @entity50 in particular is left dangling for too long . that 's not to say it is n't enjoyable . it 's just that we 've come to expect more from this brand . by anyone else 's standards , " brave " stands as a crisp , lively frolic , brimming with texture and color ( all those follicles ! ) . it 's sure to appeal to the wee bairns -- and their mams too .	@entity31:Scotland	@entity16:Brave	@entity1:Pixar	@entity21:Warrior Princess	@entity27:Up	@entity6:Cars 2	@entity30:Toy Story	@entity48:Kelly Macdonald	@entity9:Hollywood	@entity29:WALLE	@entity46:Merida	@entity52:Emma Thompson	@entity51:Elinor	@entity50:King Fergus	@entity40:Connolly	@entity41:Nessie	@entity55:Headstrong	@entity0:CNN	@entity71:Snow White	@entity73:The Hunger Games	@entity72:John Carter
during tuesday 's @entity7 address , president @placeholder touches on a number of issues	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- here is a roundup of the main themes president @entity5 touched on during tuesday 's @entity7 address : immigration where he stands : @entity5 praised his administration 's efforts at increasing border security by " putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history , " but recognized that there is still work to be done . he specifically addressed creating a path for illegal immigrants to obtain citizenship and fixing the legal immigration system by cutting waiting periods and reducing bureaucracy . what he said : " send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months , and i will sign it right away . " @entity1 @entity26 : illegal border crossings at lowest levels in 40 years @entity30 where he stands : " they deserve a vote . " @entity5 's words about the victims of gun violence echoed in the @entity36 , summing up the president 's stance on gun control . @entity5 called for a congressional vote on a series of gun control measures , including background checks in all gun sales and the prevention of anyone buying guns for resale to criminals . @entity5 's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns what he said : " senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals . police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because these police chiefs , they 're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned . each of these proposals deserves a vote in @entity72 . " " they deserve -- they deserve a simple vote . " 5 things we learned from the @entity7 climate change where he stands : @entity5 recognized the extreme shifts in climate over the past 15 years and advocated a transition to more sustainable and environment - friendly sources of energy , such as wind and solar , in order to reduce @entity87 's dependence on oil . @entity5 also proposed the creation of an @entity90 dedicated to shifting our cars and trucks off oil . what he said : " we can choose to believe that @entity96 , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence . or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it 's too late . " " i urge this @entity72 to pursue a bipartisan , market - based solution to climate change , like the one @entity106 and @entity107 worked on together a few years ago . but if @entity72 wo n't act soon to protect future generations , i will . " @entity1 @entity26 : wind energy breezes into the record books @entity111 where he stands : what is one thing @entity5 and @entity115 agreed on last year ? minimum wage . @entity5 recommended raising the federal wage to $ 9 an hour to help working families . what he said : " here 's an idea that gov. @entity115 and i actually agreed on last year . let 's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on . " " we know our economy 's stronger when we reward an honest day 's work with honest wages . but today , a full - time worker making the minimum wage earns $ 14,500 a year . even with the tax relief we 've put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line . that 's wrong . " @entity141 : the impact of $ 9 minimum wage troop withdrawal where he stands : @entity5 announced that 34,000 @entity87 troops will be withdrawn from @entity147 by next february and promised the war in @entity147 will be over by the end of 2014 . what he said : " beyond 2014 , @entity87 's commitment to a unified and sovereign @entity147 will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change . we are negotiating an agreement with the @entity147 government that focuses on two missions : training and equipping @entity147 forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of @entity165 and their affiliates . " opinion : address gave foreign policy short shrift @entity172 he stands : @entity5 's plan to reduce the national debt focuses on how to avoid the sequester and continue to reduce deficits without cutting education and job training , while asking the wealthiest @entity87 to pay more . @entity5 argued that over the last few years , " both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $ 2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts " and that the government is " halfway towards the goal of $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction . " what he said : " to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well - off and well - connected . ... now is our best chance for bipartisan , comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit . " @entity199 's @entity198 rips @entity5 , says his plans will hurt middle class @entity202 where he stands : @entity5 took a firm stance against cutting funds for @entity202 -- one of the federal government 's largest line items -- while acknowledging its contribution to the nation 's debt . @entity5 advocated the bipartisan @entity212 plan and offered to reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies . what he said : " yes , the biggest driver of our long - term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population . and those of us who care deeply about programs like @entity202 must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations . but we ca n't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful . " " we 'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for @entity202 , because our medical bills should n't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital . they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive . " @entity7 , @entity248 - style roads and bridges where he stands : in an effort to create more jobs in the @entity87 and improve the nation 's infrastructure , @entity5 proposed a " @entity256 , to put people to work on nearly 70,000 failing bridges , as well as roads . what he said : " ask any ceo where they 'd rather locate and hire : a country with deteriorating roads and bridges , or one with high - speed rail and @entity268 , high - tech schools and self - healing power grids . the ceo of @entity271 -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to @entity274 -- has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they 'll bring even more jobs . and i know that you want these job - creating projects in your districts . " @entity5 keeps pressure on @entity199 with jobs plan @entity284 he stands : @entity5 advocated for widespread enrollment in preschool , praising states like @entity288 and @entity289 that make it a priority . enrollment in preschool , @entity5 says , means students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level , graduate high school , hold a job , and form more stable families of their own . what he said : " i propose working with states to make high - quality preschool available to every child in @entity87 . every dollar we invest in high - quality early education can save more than $ 7 later on -- by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime . ... so let 's do what works , and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind . let 's give our kids that chance . " 5 education ideas from the @entity7 @entity72 where he stands : @entity5 had a lot of demands for @entity72 on tuesday night . he asked @entity72 to vote on just about every issue and called for lawmakers to work together to be more effective by successfully solving problems regardless of party divisions . what he said : " the @entity87 people do n't expect government to solve every problem . they do n't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue . but they do expect us to put the nation 's interests before party . " @entity5 dares @entity72 to get the job done foreign policy and @entity87 's future where he stands : @entity5 's plan for @entity87 's future focuses on maintaining the nation 's image as a role model for freedom in the world while reducing waste and wartime spending . what he said : " in defense of freedom , we 'll remain the anchor of strong alliances , from the @entity354 to @entity355 , from @entity356 to @entity357 . in the @entity358 , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy . " " but as @entity87 , we all share the same proud title : we are citizens . it 's a word that does n't just describe our nationality or legal status . it describes the way we 're made . it describes what we believe . it captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations ; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others ; and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these @entity87 , to be the authors of the next great chapter in our @entity87 story .

@entity14 founder @placeholder : " we 've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult "	@entity41	( @entity0 ) -- it is in our dna to explore the unknown . but pushing boundaries and exploring space is far from easy . this week , the commercial space industry received a punch in the gut and the world experienced a jarring reminder of just how dangerous space travel can be . on its 55th test flight , @entity14 's @entity13 suffered " an anomaly " just two minutes after it separated from its mother ship , @entity17 , while 45,000 feet over the @entity18 . one pilot was able to parachute out and is being treated for serious injuries , but tragically , the other perished . the catastrophe comes on the heels of an explosion that happened earlier in the week when an unmanned rocket built by @entity27 carrying a spacecraft loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of cargo exploded into a fireball just seconds after launch at @entity33 's @entity32 in @entity34 . aerospace insiders routinely compare the emerging commercial space industry to the genesis of the aviation industry -- high risk , high reward . @entity14 founder @entity41 said in a blog post following friday 's incident : " we 've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history . " a new private space race has emerged in recent years , with private companies like @entity14 and @entity52 competing to become the world 's first commercial space line . then you have companies like @entity57 , @entity27 , and @entity58 that are vying for @entity33 contracts worth billions . this week 's events put the spotlight on the private sector 's ability to shoulder the responsibility of space travel . what will the long - term impacts of disasters have on the burgeoning commercial space industry ? it should be noted , that in terms of the larger government contracts , this relationship between the public and the private is not really all that new . since the inception of the space agency , @entity33 has turned to the private sector to accomplish its space faring goals . @entity58 is the lead contractor on the @entity81 . it is not a relationship we will see change anytime soon , even in the face of the @entity27 accident . that is because the @entity89 no longer has a home - grown way to get to the @entity81 . @entity33 is relying on the private sector to get there -- making commercial companies essential to the space agency 's operations thus shielding them from the impact of public perception . the space tourism industry is different . the service it is providing is a luxury experience . the companies are at the mercy of public perception of their capabilities to safely transport paying passengers on these suborbital flights . yes , @entity14 has partnered with @entity33 to run research missions in zero - gravity , but beyond that , @entity14 relies on selling tickets to space enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies for the bulk of its development cost . and they are n't cheap . it costs $ 250,000 a seat . passengers want to know they are going to be safe . friday 's accident will surely instil fear in the more than 700 people who have signed up to make the journey . so what is the value of space tourism ? and why risk human lives to make it a reality ? as @entity133 told @entity0 earlier this year : " at heart , what inspires me the most is the idea that space changes you , that space has this profound impact on the people that can experience it . " what @entity133 is referring to is the overview effect , a phenomenon that space travelers are said to experience when they see the curvature of the @entity149 -- changing the way people see the world , thereby influencing the way in which they live . both @entity133 and @entity41 have spoken openly about the fact that suborbital flights are not the ultimate end goal for @entity14 . point - to - point intercontinental travel would be the next application of this technology , meaning that one day passengers could travel around the world in about two hours . while such plans have been put on hold since the accident , @entity14 is intent on taking off . in his blog post following the crash , @entity41 said : " space is hard -- but worth it . we will persevere and move forward together . " the question is , will people still be willing to pay $ 250,000 to go to space ? inside @entity14 's spaceship perils of aviation pioneers	@entity17:WhiteKnightTwo	@entity33:NASA	@entity14:Virgin	@entity13:SpaceShipTwo	@entity27:Orbital Sciences	@entity52:XCOR Aerospace	@entity149:Earth	@entity18:Mojave Desert	@entity81:International Space Station	@entity0:CNN	@entity57:SpaceX	@entity41:Richard Branson	@entity32:Wallops flight Facility	@entity89:U.S.	@entity58:Boeing	@entity133:Whitesides	@entity34:Virginia

" @entity2 is our son and left @entity23 with our supervision , " he told @entity21 . " what happened was a misunderstanding because i never said anything like that , they gave him wrong information . " i know what the people who need to sell newspapers are like . when there 's a story like this you need to ask for the recording to hear what was really said . " @entity1 's advisor went into further detail about the exact nature of the misunderstanding . " there 's nothing to this , @entity1 never said that @entity2 had problems with drugs , " he told @entity45 . " his answer was distorted . @entity1 was asked about problems in football , and said that the problems are few compared to other sports .

@placeholder focused on how to address poverty , minority outreach as he considers another presidential bid	@entity0	@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) @entity0 argued on wednesday that @entity4 need to spend more time targeting nontraditional @entity4 voters during presidential primaries , saying the party 's messaging gap is greatest with minority voters . " during our campaigns for the primary vote , we tend to go to the audiences that vote in a @entity4 primary and tend therefore not to be as involved in minority communities as we need to be to win the general election , " the 2012 @entity4 presidential nominee told an audience at @entity12 . " and so we got to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election , " he continued . he followed up saying he was n't urging republicans to spend less time thinking about the primary but to devote equal amount of attention to " all audiences . " @entity0 , who 's considering yet another presidential bid , made no mention of where he is in his thought process about a third campaign , but said he felt confident that " the great days of @entity33 have not ended ; they 're ahead with the right kind of leadership . " combating poverty in his speech , @entity0 hit on familiar refrains about nostalgia from his campaign as well as challenges facing the country . he also wove in swipes against @entity45 , who 's widely considered the @entity48 frontrunner if she runs for president . if @entity0 runs again , he 's likely to make anti-poverty policy a key part of his message . @entity0 said the war on poverty that started under president @entity56 " came from a good heart " but argued " the policies were n't as good as the heart . " to address the problem , @entity0 argued that the government should not create incentives for people to avoid marriage , saying a single mother on @entity65 or other assistance may not want to get married because she could lose her benefits . " if marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty , then we want to do the opposite , " he said . " we want to create incentives for them to get married , not to not get married . " he also said k - 12 education needs to improve , and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who have n't worked before , but did n't outline specifics . @entity45 @entity0 is also looking straight past his potential @entity4 rivals and sharpening his attacks against @entity81 . he argued that the former secretary of state was " clueless " on relations with @entity86 and would prove inept on economic policy if elected president . " how can secretary @entity45 provide opportunity for all if she does n't know where jobs come from in the first place ? " @entity0 said . he also argued that @entity45 helped contribute to @entity93 's " timid " approach to foreign policy . " secretary of state @entity81 cluelessly pressed a reset button for @entity86 , which smiled and then invaded @entity96 , a sovereign nation , " @entity0 said . related : @entity81 stands by ' @entity86 reset ' in face of recent events as @entity0 was headed to @entity2 , the nation 's poorest state , his political team fought back against perceptions that his wealth could be a political liability if he runs for president again , arguing that @entity45 is no model for modest living , either . " it 's going to be hard for @entity81 to make @entity0 's wealth a fruitful line of attack , with her multi-million dollar mansions in @entity115 and @entity116 and her jet - setting lifestyle of the rich and famous , " a @entity0 aide said wednesday . that comment was also included in a new report by the @entity120 that details how @entity0 purchased or built two new homes after his 2012 election loss . the former private equity ceo , whose wealth became an overriding theme for @entity48 attacks , has a total of four homes : a mansion in @entity130 , @entity131 ; a ski chalet in @entity133 , @entity134 ; a large home in @entity136 ; and a house on @entity138 , @entity139 . the home in @entity130 , complete with a car elevator , has been undergoing renovations to make it bigger since 2012 , and according the @entity120 , is now being shown to potential buys by a broker . correct the @entity148 , the pro-clinton communications and research pac , pushed back against @entity0 's response wednesday . " while @entity0 tries in vain to reinvent himself as a friend to those who are struggling , @entity81 is continuing her life - long work to lift up the middle class and level the playing field for all @entity33 , " said @entity150 , communications director for the group , said in an email to @entity3 . related : @entity160 's invisible man strategy @entity0 was constantly playing defense against multi-million dollar @entity48 campaigns that pilloried his corporate background and painted him as out of touch . he also sought to overcome a string of gaffes ‚Äï i.e. " i like being able to fire people " and " i have some great friends who are @entity170 team owners " ‚Äï that @entity48 quickly used as fuel for their fire against the then - @entity4 nominee . a spokesman for @entity45 did not immediately return a request for comment . the former secretary of state , widely seen as the @entity48 frontrunner if she runs for president , has fought her own battle against accusations of being out of touch , in part because of her six - figure speaking fees and because of comments she made last summer in which she argued that her family was " dead broke " after leaving the @entity187 . @entity0 's $ 50,000 honorarium ( minus travel costs ) is being donated to @entity190 , a restorative eyesight organization based in @entity192 , @entity134 . @entity193 contributed to this report .	@entity150:Adrienne Elrod	@entity116:Chappaqua	@entity115:Georgetown	@entity139:New Hampshire	@entity138:Lake Winnipesaukee	@entity86:Russian	@entity134:Utah	@entity136:Salt Lake City	@entity131:California	@entity130:La Jolla	@entity133:Park City	@entity3:CNN	@entity2:Mississippi	@entity1:Starkville	@entity0:Romney	@entity4:GOP	@entity193:Dan Merica	@entity192:Provo	@entity190:Charity Vision	@entity56:Lyndon B.

@entity1 launched humans of @placeholder blog	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- four years ago , @entity1 became @entity3 's unofficial photo - chronicler . with his blog , @entity4 -- which has over eight million followers on social media -- he has captured the heart and soul of the city 's multi-national inhabitants . his trademark -- the micro narratives that accompany each image -- has been imitated in the far reaches of the globe , from @entity17 to @entity18 . last month , he turned his lens , and poignant interview style , to the world at large . in partnership with the @entity23 , he is touring roughly a dozen countries in a bid to raise awareness for the peacekeeping organization 's @entity27 . his first stop : @entity30 and @entity31 . ' my eyes were opened ' though his trip was " months in the works , " @entity1 did n't anticipate that his arrival in @entity37 , @entity30 would coincide with that of @entity39 . the first people he questioned were @entity41 refugees who had only freshly fled their homes , their families , their lives as a whole . " my idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through , " admits @entity1 . for the @entity41 he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after master 's degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children ca n't stop crying for home -- @entity1 found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning . " when you 've just abandoned your house , and your family is surrounded by a hostile army , and you do n't know if they 're going to survive , it 's just inappropriate to ask what your happiest memory with your mother is , " he says . " i felt i could n't ask them beyond their present circumstances , because their lives were absolutely consumed by those circumstances . " ' pack a bag and get ready to run ' the day @entity1 landed in @entity30 , @entity39 captured the @entity74 . the day he left , the @entity75 started air strikes . his time there , he admits , was often terrifying . " when i was in @entity80 , there was a moment i got a call in the middle of the night from @entity84 telling to pack a bag and get ready to run , because @entity39 was shelling the town and had broken through the lines , " he recalls . " it was an abundance of caution it turned out , but it was a sleepless night . " it was one of many moments , he admits , when he appreciated what it means to feel secure . " i went to this place where all people wanted was a bit of security : to send their kids to school , to start a business , to get married and live a normal life . and i realized that in the absence of physical security , no other layers of life can really be experienced , " he says . " that constant uncertainty seeps into your psyche in a way that you ca n't really pinpoint until you go back to a place that is secure . " for @entity1 , that place was @entity31 . " i really noticed when i landed in @entity31 , where the infrastructures was in place and there was no imminent threat , that there was a load lifted from my psyche , " he says . the stories he heard were different as well . the tenor , though often still heart - breaking ( he visited @entity120 that houses around 80,000 @entity121 ) , demonstrated a lighter side of the human character . in the absence of immediate danger , there was hope . " the other thing this trip has made me realize is the depth of ambition , particularly in underdeveloped countries , " he says . " everybody i talked to had such big dreams , and often such limited opportunities with which to achieve those dreams .

@entity122 : prince @placeholder could be any new dad , doing things his own way	@entity1	" what is prince @entity1 like ? " it 's a question i often get asked , and in this interview i think people will , for the first time , get a real sense of his character . i would love to say it was purely down to me , but it probably has more to do with the moment . @entity1 was less than two weeks into parenthood when i spoke to him . he was tired , elated and still grappling with how he 'd changed since becoming a father . i could sense how he had been consumed by his new way of life -- i 've been there myself and other fathers will pick up on it too . he may be a prince but he 's doing it the old - fashioned ( non-royal ) way . he and his wife are the ones getting up at night and changing the nappies / diapers . @entity1 was the one who , outside the hospital , fixed his son 's car seat in , then drove home for the first time with his new family . he 's a royal duke and he has people who can do all these things for him , but he 's doing it himself . as a result , this heir to the throne has been given a rare insight into what it 's like to be ordinary , and we 're able to connect with him . i met @entity1 at @entity43 . i had been chasing an interview with him for more than two years , so i was n't there by chance , but in the end it all felt quite informal and relaxed . it was almost as if we had bumped into each other as we both walked into a room at the same time . we started chatting , he was on great form and i knew immediately that he was going to give a great interview . the plan was to discuss @entity55 conservation and specifically a new award scheme organized by one of his charities , the @entity58 . inevitably we ended up chatting about fatherhood as well . the conversation continued as we walked out of the main building , past the small cottage he 's currently occupying with his family and into their walled garden where the interview would take place . the duke only had his press secretary with him and neither of them raised any notable questions or concerns . in fact before i knew it , the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way . i had decided not to rely on notes and just have a conversation . it worked . @entity1 was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work , and i ca n't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month 's special . the subject of @entity88 came up several times during the discussion about conservation , and his father was happy to talk about his son in his own right too . i was struck by how he had what felt like a particularly tight family unit . it was the way he said : " for me , @entity97 , and now little @entity98 are my priorities ... and @entity100 ( the dog ) . " i also thought it was interesting that he is n't sending out a message about modern monarchy in the way that he 's handling things , he 's just doing it his own way , being himself . it could be any new dad , and that 's what i like about the interview . his honesty even stretched to admitting he 's looking forward to going back to work ... something other new dads will relate to , but perhaps wo n't admit quite as easily . there 's more next month when we air what 's set to be a stunning documentary .	@entity1:William	@entity98:George	@entity100:Lupo	@entity88:Prince George	@entity55:African	@entity43:Kensington Palace	@entity97:Catherine	@entity58:Tusk Trust	@entity122:Foster	@entity123:CNN

" people were fleeing in panic and only have what they could carry , " said @entity83 , acting country director of @entity78 , said friday . he said there is an urgent need for food , water , mats , blankets and hygiene kits -- items that the group is already distributing . workers are also in the process of getting emergency latrines and setting up temporary schools for children . @entity101 , regional information officer with the @entity103 's humanitarian aid department , said friday that many residents were expecting a minor outbreak , but the eruptions had become much worse . @entity108 balls have rained down on villages and houses have burned , @entity101 said . streets and cars are covered in ash , and people are wearing face masks .

@placeholder is missing some 20 - year - old @entity9 bourbon	@entity7	a bourbon heist at a high - end @entity2 distillery has left tongues wagging in elite whiskey circles and some small - town cops wondering whodunit . the @entity7 in @entity8 noticed this week that it was missing some of its 20 - year - old @entity9 , one of the rarest and most sought after bourbons in the world . " it 's highly coveted , " said @entity14 sheriff @entity13 , the man leading the investigation . " it 's the best of the best . " @entity13 said the distillery called him on tuesday to report that 65 cases , or 195 bottles , of the high - end hard stuff were unaccounted for . nine cases of @entity23 were also missing . " we believe whoever did this took them out the back from the secured area over a period of two months " @entity13 said . " obviously , the way this happened , it 's indicative of an inside job . " @entity7 did not respond to requests for comment , but @entity13 said the distillery employs about 50 people and operates two shifts . just how coveted is @entity9 ? while the listed retail price is $ 130 per bottle , the bourbon is so rare that consumers usually end up paying much more to get a bottle , if they can find one , said @entity46 of @entity47 . " there is a lot of mystery around how to even get one , " he said . one place to get one is online retailer @entity55 , where a bottle of 20 - year - old @entity9 costs $ 1,199 . " it 's the pinnacle of bourbon , " gushed @entity57 . " if you 're around a bottle , it 's a special occasion . " @entity13 said officials are in the early stages of the investigation , and will be on the lookout for any bottles popping up on the black market . but the thief might not be in any rush , @entity57 said . " if you keep bourbon in the right conditions , it will be good forever . " " you have to wonder what 's going to happen to the 195 stolen bottles , " said @entity75 , ceo of the all - things cocktail website @entity77 .

@placeholder predicted a short winter and a quick arrival of spring	@entity0	@entity0 lied . that 's what a prosecutor in @entity3 says . he has filed a criminal " indictment " against the famed groundhog , who , year for year on february 2 , emerges from his burrow at @entity0 to predict whether spring will come early or winter will linger . if he sees his shadow , it means six more weeks of chill . if not , short sleeves are days away . this year , @entity0 got it wrong , and it 's not the first time . on the first day of spring this past wednesday , the @entity16 got pelted with more than a foot of snow . it 's still cold two days later , and more chilly weather is in the forecast . snow on the first day of spring @entity23 is sick of it , and he wants someone to pay . " i woke up this morning and the wind was blowing , the snow was flying , the temperatures were falling , and i said ' @entity0 , you let us down , ' " the prosecutor told @entity28 affiliate @entity27 . the homepage of the @entity36 , @entity3 , prosecutor 's office , which @entity23 heads , prominently features alerts against scammers . shadows are n't just for groundhogs @entity23 is convinced that @entity0 is one and that he intentionally misled the nation . now , trouble with the law is a brewing for the famous rodent from @entity46 , @entity47 . not really . it 's all in good fun , of course , and @entity0 's handlers are getting in on the joke . but they are not " ratting " him out . " if you remember two weeks ago on a sunday , it was probably 60 , 65 degrees , " handler @entity53 told @entity27 in @entity0 's defense . " so , i mean , that basically counts as an early spring . " after snow storms and blizzards for weeks from @entity61 to the @entity62 and into the @entity63 and @entity64 , not many @entity58 may buy it . but @entity0 may not be at fault . some may have thought in the past that his predictions were a vast conspiracy . after all , he is sponsored by two clubs , a handful of corporations and two banks . on @entity0 's website , @entity75 , his handlers dispute the theory . " no , @entity0 's forecasts are not made in advance by the @entity80 , " they write . the off prediction could have been a mistranslation . @entity0 " speaks to the @entity84 president in @entity85 , " according to the website . " his proclamation is then translated for the world . " what if the president ca n't hear correctly over the crowd ? is it then still really @entity0 's fault ? @entity23 is sticking by his guns . " @entity0 did purposely , and with prior calculation and design , cause people to believe that @entity98 would come early , " the indictment reads . he recommends the death penalty . " he 's already serving a life sentence behind bars , as you know , " @entity23 told @entity27 . @entity0 has been making his predictions since 1887 and will probably continue . extraditing him from @entity47 to @entity3 to stand trial is unlikely , since transporting wild animals across state lines can be illegal . people may be angry with @entity0 about his prediction as winter 's chill dawdles . but lighten up . he 's just a groundhog .	@entity3:Ohio	@entity16:Northeast	@entity0:Phil	@entity61:Arizona	@entity27:WXIX	@entity23:Gmoser	@entity28:CNN	@entity36:Butler County	@entity46:Punxsutawney	@entity80:Inner Circle	@entity53:John Griffiths	@entity47:Pennsylvania	@entity84:Groundhog Club	@entity85:Groundhogese	@entity98:Spring	@entity75:Groundhog.org	@entity64:New England	@entity58:Americans	@entity62:Dakotas	@entity63:Midwest	@entity112:Michael Gmoser

in 1978 , 909 @entity1 were led to mass murder - suicide by rev. @placeholder	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- thirty years ago , 909 @entity1 were led to their death by the rev. @entity3 in a mass murder - suicide pact in a @entity6 jungle , shortly after @entity3 ' gunmen killed a visiting @entity1 congressman and four others at a nearby airstrip . one - third of the victims were children . many were killed by @entity3 ' aides , who squirted cyanide down their throats . of the nearly 1,000 church members who began the day in @entity18 , a cult commune , only 33 survived to see the next day . the following is a thumbnail history of the @entity18 tragedy on nov. 18 , 1978 : what happened ? more than 900 @entity1 died in a @entity6 jungle upon the orders of rev. @entity3 , who had tried to create a socialist paradise that survivors called a slave camp . what led up to this ? when @entity33 rep. @entity32 arrived on a one - man investigative mission , bringing along a tv camera crew and various reporters , 15 church members asked to leave with him . @entity3 sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip , where they killed @entity32 , an @entity41 correspondent and his cameraman , a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members . who was @entity3 ? he was a self - appointed minister from a small town in the @entity48 , who first led his flock to @entity33 , where he hoped to avoid fallout from a possible nuclear war . he then moved his people to @entity54 when he came under criticism for church beatings and financial abuses . where did the money come from ? @entity3 was a phony faith healer , and much of his money came in mail - order donations from the desperate . elderly members handed over their @entity65 checks , working adults gave 25 percent of their wages to the church and some signed over all their property . government investigators would later find at least $ 10 million in @entity72 banks , mainly in @entity73 . another $ 1 million in cash was recovered in @entity18 . did anyone survive ? thirty - three people who began that day in @entity18 escaped with their lives . there were two main groups of survivors . eleven people , four of them small children , walked almost 30 miles through the jungle to another town . fourteen departing church members lived through the airport ambush -- five of them youngsters who were lost for three days when they ran into the jungle to hide . see list of survivors what happened to the killers ? all but one of the airport gunmen died in the mass suicide . @entity95 , who posed as a defector , was captured after badly wounding two people inside a plane trying to take off . he was not paroled from an @entity6 prison until 2002 . how did @entity3 die ? he did not drink the cyanide . he was shot in the head , probably by a trusted aide , at the very end . his body was among the first to be identified -- through fingerprints that had been taken after a vice squad arrest five years earlier in the men 's room of a @entity110 movie theater . what is left of @entity18 today ? nothing . the settlement has disappeared , the buildings dismantled and carried away by native @entity115 . jungle weeds and trees have overgrown the area again . the only notable relic left to be found are the remains of one small rusting garden tractor . what persists is simply silence .	@entity3:Jones	@entity1:Americans	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:American	@entity54:Guyana	@entity33:California	@entity18:Jonestown	@entity115:Indians	@entity32:Ryan	@entity41:NBC	@entity110:Los Angeles	@entity95:Larry Layton	@entity65:Social Security	@entity48:Midwest	@entity73:Panama	@entity72:Swiss
@entity176 : on @placeholder , we should celebrate contributions of stepfathers	@entity5	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- i know it 's called " @entity5 , " not " @entity6 . " but not all fathers are fathers , biologically speaking . and on @entity5 , we also should celebrate their efforts , thankless as they may be . take @entity10 , my children 's stepfather . my first husband and i divorced 15 years ago , and i married @entity10 in 1999 . to borrow from humorist @entity14 when writing about her stepfather , if @entity10 had been the relief pitcher brought in to bail out his team , the crowd would have cheered . had he been the off - duty cop who delivered the baby because the ambulance was stuck in traffic , he would have been called a hero . or had he been the understudy who filled in when the beloved star got sick , he might have gotten rave reviews . but @entity10 was n't any of these things . instead , when he became my husband , @entity10 also became stepfather to my two children , @entity27 bless him . to the kids , he was like instant iced tea , not the steeped kind ; store - bought cookies , not freshly baked ; store brand cola , not the real thing . simply put , he was not their biological father . in the eyes of my children , @entity10 was an alien who appeared one day , hypnotized their mother and set up camp in their home , toting his organic food , reggae music , incense and all things @entity47 . he was someone to endure , if not at times ignore -- that is until they needed a ride somewhere , the latest cell phone or a new computer . the first few years in what sociologists call " a blended family " can sometimes be open warfare . i understand why . children often resent the sudden realignment of their home and their lives . " you 're not my father , " the kids would sometimes yell at him , " you ca n't tell me what to do ! " and when he looked to me for backup , he 'd often have to hear : " you 're not their father so you ca n't tell them what to do ! " i might have had my reasons then , but i regret that now . i think of all the times @entity10 had to play second fiddle at the birthday parties , graduations and even my daughter 's debutante ball . i know it had to be painful when the children hung photos of their " nuclear family " on their bedroom walls and he was nowhere in them . for the most part , he put up with all this generously and without a fuss , and i appreciate that . it was a tough time for all of us . but over the past 13 years that @entity10 has been in our lives , and after hundreds of family meetings , hours of group therapy sessions and more than a dozen self - help books , ( including " @entity97 " ) , i 've finally noticed a change of hearts . it is now clear @entity10 has had a tremendous impact on my -- let me rephrase -- our children 's lives . for instance , my husband has devoted his entire life to the economic development of @entity47 . it is no coincidence that our 27 - year - old son is a successful businessman living in @entity47 . and our 23 - year - old daughter is serving in the @entity112 ; @entity10 was one of the first @entity113 to serve in the @entity112 in @entity114 in 1962 . so although i can say i am proud that our children have independently chosen to lead lives of global service , i am equally convinced that it is due in part to @entity10 's influence in their lives . research shows that a good father can help set his children on the right course in life . in studies of children in homes headed by single mothers , the @entity113 @entity128 found that many children without active fathers have lower grade point averages , lower college aspirations , poor school attendance records , higher dropout rates and are more likely to be in trouble with the law than children who live with both parents . sociologists have also concluded adolescent girls from 15 to 19 years old reared in homes without fathers are significantly more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant than girls reared in homes with a mother and a father . so the presence of fathers in our homes is not only important . it is sometimes vital . each home is different , and every family has its own particular challenges , often including the challenge of a failed father or one who is absent altogether . but no matter whether the men who have a positive influence on the lives of our children are their birth fathers or their stepfathers , grandfathers , uncles , brothers or teachers , their contributions are important . and we should include these men when we celebrate @entity5 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Georgia	@entity0:Atlanta	@entity6:Stepfather 's Day	@entity5:Father 's Day	@entity10:Haskell	@entity176:Leah Ward Sears	@entity187:Sears	@entity14:Erma Bombeck	@entity113:U.S.	@entity112:Peace Corps	@entity128:Department of Health and Human Services	@entity47:Africa	@entity97:Step-parenting for Dummies	@entity114:Ethiopia	@entity27:God
the first family will travel to @entity81 , @placeholder , saturday	@entity82	( @entity1 ) -- " everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well , " national incident commander @entity0 said friday of the now - plugged @entity3 gusher in the @entity4 , adding that officials are now considering other options in addition to the relief well . work will resume on a relief well as scientists and @entity3 engineers continue to assess whether a planned " bottom kill " is necessary , he said . the @entity3 oil well , which ruptured april 20 after an explosion on the @entity19 oil rig , spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the @entity4 before being successfully shut . @entity0 said that pressure tests were finished and that pressure within the wellhead was unchanged . that means there are options about how to handle the well , which has stopped pouring oil into the @entity4 , he said . " we have successfully shut in this well . we have something now that we have n't had before and we have we have -- i would n't call it a luxury -- but we have the trade space to consider alternatives under less than a high - pressure situation . " @entity0 said crews probably did " too good a job on the top kill . " cement and mud got into a core area of the well . but @entity0 said it 's not clear how thick the cement layer is , or how vulnerable it might be to pressure inside the well . " everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well , " @entity0 said . " the relief well will be finished . how it gets finished will be determined on risk mitigation and the way forward is the essence of what is being discussed right now . the relief well will be finished . we will kill the well . " as they await answers about the condition of the well , businesses in the @entity60 are hoping high - profile visitors will help boost local economies . president @entity66 and his wife , @entity67 , plan to travel to the region this weekend to support businesses that have been devastated by the oil disaster . one of their daughters , @entity73 , will join them for the trip . their other daughter , @entity76 , is at a camp and will not make the trip , a senior administration official said . the family will leave saturday morning for @entity81 , @entity82 . " even as the president talks about what our next steps are in our response , obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place , " @entity84 spokesman @entity83 told reporters earlier this week . visitors spent more than $ 34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the @entity60 , sustaining 400,000 jobs . the effects of the oil spill on the region 's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $ 22.7 billion , according to an analysis conducted last month by @entity103 for the @entity104 . in preparing the research , @entity103 looked at current spending , government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the @entity4 disaster 's impact . case studies of past disasters -- including the @entity118 respiratory disease outbreak , @entity119 and the 2004 @entity121 tsunami -- show that tourism often is affected beyond the disaster area and long after the resolution of the crisis . to mitigate the effects of the disaster , changing perceptions is key . " the president will meet with those folks and have a chance to update , i think , the region on where we are , " @entity83 said . " and i think it will be important for the president to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back . " meanwhile , work is expected to resume friday on the drilling of a relief well that is intended to give engineers a better look at the core of the well . pressure tests will help them make a recommendation to former adm. @entity0 , the federal government point man on the disaster , on whether a bottom kill is necessary to permanently seal the ruptured deepwater oil well . the well erupted after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig @entity19 that left 11 dead . a temporary cap contained the spill on july 15 , and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back under the ocean floor last week in the static kill process . the well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels ( nearly 2.3 million gallons ) of oil per day before it was capped . since then , fresh , green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest - hit marshes of southern @entity165 , but oil continues to wash ashore in some places . @entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .	@entity3:BP	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Thad Allen	@entity118:SARS	@entity4:Gulf	@entity168:Vivian Kuo	@entity165:Louisiana	@entity19:Deepwater Horizon	@entity81:Panama City Beach	@entity82:Florida	@entity103:Oxford Economics	@entity104:U.S. Travel Association	@entity73:Sasha	@entity67:Michelle	@entity66:Obama	@entity84:White House	@entity76:Malia	@entity83:Gibbs	@entity60:Gulf Coast	@entity119:Hurricane Katrina	@entity121:Asian
@entity1 president @placeholder : we welcome @entity15 comments	@entity13	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 's president said tuesday his country welcomes talks with the @entity6 " in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect . " women in @entity0 celebrate the 30th anniversary of the @entity12 revolution tuesday . @entity13 made the remarks a day after president @entity15 said the @entity6 is looking for opportunities for " face to face " dialogue with @entity1 , even though he has " deep concerns " about @entity0 's actions . " right now , the world is entering the era of dialogue , " @entity13 told hundreds of thousands of people in a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the @entity12 revolution . " the new @entity6 administration announced that it 's willing to bring about a number of changes and is now taking the course for dialogue . it 's quite clear that real change should be fundamental , not just a tactical change , and it is quite clear that the @entity1 nation will greet real changes . " the @entity1 nation is ready to hold up talks , but talks in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect , " @entity13 said . in @entity41 , @entity15 was asked about @entity6 relations with @entity1 during his first prime - time news conference on monday night . watch news conference in full ¬ª " there 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight , " @entity15 said . he said his administration is reviewing existing @entity6 policy toward @entity1 , which supports groups @entity41 has branded terrorist organizations , such as @entity53 and @entity54 , and has defied @entity56 demands to halt its uranium enrichment program . despite those concerns , @entity15 said his administration wants to use " all the resources at the @entity6 ' disposal " to resolve those concerns . " my expectation is , in the coming months , we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table , face - to - face diplomatic overtures , that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction , " @entity15 said . " so there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations , but i think that there 's the possibility at least of a relationship of mutual respect and progress . " the @entity6 and @entity1 have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . during that year , the @entity80 was forced to flee the country and the @entity82 took power . later that year , @entity1 students took over and seized hostages at the @entity6 embassy . relations have been cut since then . @entity6 president @entity88 labeled @entity1 as a member of the " axis of evil " after the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks . @entity1 celebrated the 30th anniversary of the revolution tuesday with crowds chanting " @entity95 . " watch the parade in @entity1 ¬ª tensions have rippled over issues such as @entity1 's nuclear program , @entity100 , and @entity101 , and have been aggravated since the outspoken @entity13 came to power in 2005 . western nations believe @entity1 is intent on building a nuclear weapon . @entity13 has been criticized for his vehemence against and provocative remarks toward @entity100 and for @entity1 's support of @entity54 militants in @entity109 and the @entity53 movement in @entity111 -- militants groups that @entity100 has battled . also , the @entity6 has accused @entity1 of backing @entity101 insurgents . in recent years , the @entity101 conflict has provided an opportunity for @entity1 and the @entity6 to cooperate since both countries support the @entity118 - dominated @entity101 government and @entity101 have urged both countries to put aside their differences in helping @entity101 . in 2007 , @entity6 and @entity101 envoys met several times in @entity123 . @entity13 addressed the conflict in @entity101 , saying that 1 million people have been killed and others have been displaced because of the " @entity88 administration war on @entity101 . " " to deal with the root cause of insecurity i think that we should go and find the main culprits , including @entity88 himself and his administration . they must be put on trial , " said @entity13 . " the world does not want to see the dark age of @entity88 being repeated . " addressing the issue of terrorism , @entity13 said @entity1 has been fighting terror for 30 years and that @entity1 itself been victimized by terror . " if you want to fight terrorism in practice come and work with the @entity1 nation , " he said . " if you want to eradicate the root causes of massacres and aggression , let 's sit together and see what has been behind the reasons why we have had wars in the @entity154 and the @entity155 . " as usual , he had harsh words for @entity100 , a state he loathes and a topic that whips up passions among his supporters . " if you want to eradicate crime , let 's work together with the @entity1 nation and other nations of the world and let 's put on trial the @entity169 leaders of the @entity169 regime , " the @entity1 leader said . as for nuclear power , @entity1 has said it wants to harness it for energy and @entity13 indicated @entity1 is against deploying nuclear weaponry . " if you want to fight proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , then you should join us and help us so that we will show you the right way . yes we 're opposed to nuclear weapons of mass destruction . they 're real threats and they must be destroyed . @entity1 has been a victim of the use of chemical weapons of mass destruction but the only way would be justice and the use of appropriate mechanisms , " he said . " if they really want to have real security , then they should be able to work with us and then we will be able to revisit the structure of the @entity197 -- and remember the @entity197 itself is the root cause of discrimination -- we should change this structure and then have justice . " the @entity6 also is concerned about @entity1 's technological pursuits . @entity1 successfully launched its first satellite into orbit last week , a step hailed by @entity1 's president as a " source of pride " for the @entity12 republic , according to state - run news outlets . the launch of the satellite @entity212 -- which means " @entity215 " in @entity216 -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the @entity12 revolution in @entity1 , according to @entity1 media reports . @entity6 @entity221 officials confirmed the launch , and the @entity223 expressed " grave concern . " in august , @entity1 performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit . @entity1 officials declared that mission a success , but @entity6 officials disputed that . senior @entity6 officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket , saying @entity1 could use the rocket to deliver warheads . on monday , @entity15 said @entity1 must " send some signals that it wants to act differently , as well , and recognize that , even as it has some rights as a member of the international community , with those rights come responsibilities . " " it 's important that , even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country , that @entity1 understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable , that we 're clear about the fact that a nuclear @entity1 could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing . " praising @entity1 's people history and traditions as " extraordinary , @entity15 says the nation 's actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world . " " their financing of terrorist organizations like @entity53 and @entity54 , the bellicose language that they 've used towards @entity100 , their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon , that all those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests , but i think are contrary to the interests of international peace .

day fans of @entity12 's outlaws can safely step into one of the most famous gunfights in history and the first successful daylight robbery . although famous outlaws @entity18 and @entity20 are n't usually embraced for their violence , their exploits are a part of @entity12 's history . the birthplaces , graves and trails once traveled by these famous @entity12 criminals can be found all over the @entity12 . here are some of the best locations to relive the most well - known rogues of yesteryear . @entity18 , @entity32 and @entity33 american gangster @entity18 , whose criminal run was featured in the 2009 @entity37 movie " @entity38 , " robbed two dozen banks and four police stations during his depression - era crime spree . with all the violent criminals running rampant at the time , @entity18 is probably the most infamous of all : his crimes inspired the @entity46 to develop their organized crime unit and made it a priority to catch @entity18 . @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity32 , was the site of the famous 1934 @entity18 gang shootout with the @entity46 in which @entity18 , attempting to hide and evade law enforcement , narrowly escaped with his life . with hundreds of bullet holes in the windows and walls , it 's preserved just as it was 80 years ago . the lodge is still open for dining , but with an updated menu . another famous @entity18 site is @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity33 . @entity18 was arrested after a fire at the hotel , transferred to @entity69 and escaped prison months before the @entity50 shootout . @entity20 , @entity72 @entity20 was one of the most prolific outlaws of the @entity74 , believed to have robbed dozens of banks and trains . although he lived and died in the state of @entity72 , the @entity77 was responsible for major heists in many other states . after being pursued by law enforcement for nearly 20 years , ironically @entity20 was shot and killed by one of his fellow gang members for a $ 10,000 reward . the 2007 @entity86 movie " @entity87 " focuses on the outlaw 's death and his relationship with @entity91 , the friend who shot him in the back of the head . the @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity72 , is the birthplace and childhood home of @entity20 , born in 1847 . visitors can tour the restored home and see where the adventure began . the town hosts an annual @entity20 festival in september . @entity105 , @entity72 's @entity106 is known as the site of the nation 's first successful daylight peaceful bank robbery in 1866 . although the culprits were never caught , this robbery has been attributed to the @entity77 . in nearby @entity112 is the @entity113 , where @entity20 was killed . this museum holds artifacts of @entity20 ' life and death , including the evidence from his 1995 exhumation that laid to rest the rumors that he was n't really dead . @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 immortalized in the 1967 movie " @entity121 , " @entity121 traveled the central @entity12 and robbed banks during the @entity126 . in 1934 , only a few years after their killing spree began , the couple was ambushed in @entity130 , @entity123 by @entity122 and @entity123 law enforcement who had been in pursuit . caught off - guard , it 's said they were shot to death in their car without ever returning fire . @entity130 , eight miles @entity141 of @entity142 , @entity123 , has a monument at the ambush site that tourists can visit . the cement marker is repeatedly vandalized and scavenged by souvenir hunters and has to be replaced often , but remains standing . both natives of @entity150 , numerous places from their past can be found in and around the @entity150 - @entity154 area . the pair 's gravesites and @entity158 's elementary school are just a few of the sites that can be visited . @entity161 and the @entity162 , @entity163 to relive the adventures of the real - life @entity165 , featured in the 1969 movie starring @entity167 and @entity168 , head to @entity169 , @entity163 . the town holds @entity161 's home in @entity172 , @entity173 and trails commonly traveled by his gang , and several others , for safe passage and places to hide out . @entity179 pass , in the @entity180 , once held the log cabin where @entity161 's @entity183 gang met . located in a secluded area , lawmen could n't approach without the gang knowing , keeping them safe . the cabin is preserved at the @entity189 . some 20 miles west of @entity190 is the @entity191 , another spot where the gang used to hide out . the cave was well hidden and bordered @entity195 , allowing for a quick exit from authorities and rival gangs . @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 perhaps the most notorious of all @entity12 mobsters was @entity199 , the infamous leader of the @entity204 mafia during prohibition . the 1929 @entity206 , in which @entity199 's men lured and killed rival bootleggers , turned the mob boss into a household name , as the media went wild . despite all the killings for which he was responsible , @entity199 was convicted of tax evasion in 1931 and served only seven years in prison . he died at his home in 1947 , immortalized as one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century . @entity220 played @entity199 in the 1987 box office hit " @entity222 , " which recounted @entity46 agent @entity224 's fight to bring @entity199 to justice . @entity199 spent eight months at @entity226 , @entity200 's @entity227 in 1929 . this was @entity199 's first prison sentence , for carrying a concealed and deadly weapon , and he spent his time in a cell on @entity233 with fine furniture , a cabinet radio and other luxuries . @entity199 's grave is just outside @entity204 at @entity238 , with a stone monument and flat marker . it 's not unusual for visitors to leave icons of his legendary status , such as cigars and bottles of alcohol . @entity249 , @entity250 @entity249 only lived to be 21 , dying in 1881 , but it 's believed he killed eight people in his short life . a frontier outlaw of the @entity74 , @entity249 started his life of thievery and crime early , eventually joining the @entity258 , a gang of lawmen - turned - outlaws . @entity167 also took on the role as a young @entity249 in a 1958 movie that portrayed the outlaw as a misunderstood young man . in 1880 , @entity249 was arrested for killing a @entity265 sheriff and subsequently escaped jail after being sentenced to death . a year later , he was found and shot to death by sheriff @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity250 . the @entity270 in @entity269 opened in 1953 and is filled with over 60,000 relics of the @entity74 , many of them historic . the adjoining state monument , @entity273 , was once a familiar haunt of @entity249 's . with plenty of friends nearby and no lawman within a day 's travel , it was an ideal place to lie low . when strangers arrived , locals would alert " @entity249 , " so he could disappear into the countryside until it was safe to return . @entity285 , @entity286 a vital part in developing the @entity288 , @entity285 was born in @entity289 , @entity290 , in 1906 but became famous for his role in the development of the @entity288 strip 40 years later . before moving to @entity286 , he spent years in @entity290 and @entity294 as a bootlegger and ruthless killer . the 1991 @entity298 film " @entity299 " depicted the mobster 's life in @entity294 and his rise to power in @entity288 . a lifelong gambler , it was @entity285 's dream to open a huge casino in the burgeoning @entity286 desert , and with funding from the @entity311 mob , he built the $ 6 million @entity312 in 1946 . when @entity285 's associate , @entity313 , discovered the high cost was due to @entity285 's theft and mismanagement , @entity285 was gunned down in his @entity318 home only one year after the casino opened . although @entity313 was never officially linked to the crime , it 's almost undoubtable that he ordered the hit . one of the first resorts to open on the strip , the @entity312 ( the earliest incarnation of the modern hotel standing today ) remains a popular destination in @entity288 . a bronze plaque memorial remains at the hotel , set in front of the wedding chapel , making for some very distinctive wedding photos . the @entity332 , @entity333 if you do n't have time to travel the country in search of outlaws , @entity333 's @entity332 holds one of the country 's largest collections of criminal artifacts . visitors can see relics of some of the most famous outlaws and gangsters , such as @entity18 's car and items from @entity199 's restaurant , @entity351 's . there are even galleries featuring the history of crime dating back to the @entity356 .	@entity273:Old Fort Sumner	@entity270:Billy the Kid Museum	@entity173:Outlaw Cave	@entity172:Old Trail Town	@entity179:Hole-in-the-Wall	@entity74:Wild West	@entity77:James gang	@entity72:Missouri	@entity220:Robert De Niro	@entity269:Fort Sumner	@entity268:Pat Garrett	@entity265:Lincoln County	@entity141:South	@entity142:Gibsland	@entity69:Indiana	@entity66:Tucson	@entity65:Hotel Congress	@entity250:New Mexico	@entity158:Parker	@entity258:Regulators	@entity150:Dallas	@entity154:Fort Worth	@entity311:East Coast	@entity313:Lansky	@entity312:Flamingo Hotel	@entity318:Beverly Hills	@entity51:Manitowish Waters	@entity50:Little Bohemia	@entity33:Arizona	@entity32:Wisconsin	@entity37:Johnny Depp	@entity38:Public Enemies	@entity126:Great Depression	@entity122:Texas	@entity123:Louisiana	@entity249:The Kid	@entity121:Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow	@entity46:FBI	@entity20:Jesse James	@entity333:Washington , D.C.	@entity332:Crime Museum	@entity130:Bienville Parish	@entity233:Park Avenue Block	@entity238:Mount Carmel Cemetery	@entity12:American	@entity5:Or	@entity18:John Dillinger	@entity105:Liberty	@entity106:Jesse James Bank Museum	@entity96:Kearney	@entity95:Jesse James Farm and Museum	@entity91:Robert Ford	@entity189:Old Trail Town Museum	@entity222:The Untouchables	@entity224:Eliot Ness	@entity227:Eastern State Penitentiary	@entity226:Philadelphia	@entity180:Big Horn Mountains	@entity183:Wild Bunch	@entity113:Jesse James Home Museum	@entity112:St. Joseph	@entity86:Brad Pitt	@entity87:The Assassination of Jesse James	@entity356:Middle Ages	@entity351:Colosimo	@entity0:CNN	@entity199:Al Capone	@entity195:Colorado	@entity191:Outlaw Cave Recreation Area	@entity190:Kaycee	@entity298:Warren Beatty	@entity299:Bugsy	@entity294:California	@entity290:New York	@entity201:Illinois	@entity200:Pennsylvania	@entity206:St. Valentine 's Day Massacre	@entity204:Chicago	@entity162:Sundance Kid	@entity163:Wyoming	@entity161:Butch Cassidy	@entity167:Paul Newman	@entity165:Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid	@entity168:Robert Redford	@entity169:Cody	@entity286:Nevada	@entity285:Siegel	@entity289:Brooklyn	@entity288:Las Vegas
pubs bolster staffs , as @placeholder plan to skip school , work for monday match	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- it 's no @entity2 . @entity4 , it 's no @entity5 , but for an @entity14 audience , monday 's @entity10 derby -- that is , the @entity7 club soccer game between @entity10 's two @entity9 teams -- is about as big as it gets stateside . sure , many @entity14 sports fans call the sport boring and complain there 's not enough scoring . it moves too slowly , they say , and is marred by @entity20 who flop to the ground if you breathe on them . haters aside , the @entity14 is taking notice . @entity26 moved the game from @entity26 to its flagship station , a first for a weekday @entity9 game . pubs across the nation are anticipating big crowds , and some @entity14 are doing something very @entity35 for match day : skipping out of work early . " you 'll definitely want to see this . it 's as high a stakes game as you 'll see in any soccer league in the world , " said @entity43 senior writer and soccer guru , @entity40 . @entity40 likened the match between no. 1 @entity49 and no. 2 @entity50 to the @entity52 and @entity53 playing in the @entity2 , or perhaps the @entity54 , which pits cross-state rivals @entity55 and @entity56 against each other at the end of the college football season . @entity61 experience key to @entity62 he 's never seen a @entity10 derby this important in the 15 years he 's been covering soccer , said @entity40 , who authored the book , " @entity66 : how the @entity68 tried to @entity69 . " @entity26 announced this week it moved the game to take advantage of the live edition of " sportscenter " that will lead into the game , which begins at 3 p.m. et. in an e-mail , spokesman @entity70 said the paid programming on @entity26 prior to the game typically draws about 221,000 viewers , where " @entity74 " will have an expected audience of 482,000 . the live lead - in is key to sports programming , he said . the network 's @entity9 offerings on @entity26 this year are 50 % percent higher than last year 's games , so @entity7 soccer 's popularity is increasing in the @entity14 , @entity70 said . " best matchup of the season , " @entity70 said of monday 's game . " so far , 20 teams have each played an average of 36 matches . and with two match - days to go , @entity9 has one game that is akin to a title game in a league series not decided by knockouts . " we 've come a long way @entity35 sports commentator @entity102 , who will be calling the game for @entity26 , predicts a " turbo - charged occasion " and said he has noticed @entity69 's growing interest in soccer since @entity106 hired him to call games for the @entity14 - hosted @entity108 in 1994 . " producers ( back then ) said to explain what offsides was and explain the laws of the game as we went along , " he recalled . " now , there 's been a complete change of emphasis . " today , more @entity14 -- many of whom played the sport in school and youth leagues -- have a better grasp on the basics , and commentators cover games in a more " authentic way , as if it were being broadcast for a @entity129 audience . " @entity26 is n't the only one sensing the game taking off in the states . @entity132 , a bartender at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135 , said that not so long ago @entity133 was the premier place to watch @entity7 soccer in the city . as the game has become more popular , more bars carry the matches and more people get the games at home , so the number of patrons coming to watch soccer at @entity133 has taken a hit . of the derby monday , @entity132 said he 's received calls from people asking if he 's showing it , and he expects a few more patrons than usual during the lunchtime rush . a @entity0 facebook page asking if fans were planning to skip work or school monday drew plenty of the aforementioned haters , but a handful of fans said they 'd be playing hooky . " will be skipping class at @entity165 and have already re-scheduled couple meetings already , " wrote @entity163 , a @entity49 fan . " work ? school ? bills ? life ? all of it stops when the @entity172 is in play ! " wrote fellow @entity170 . added @entity174 , " i 'm coming home very early from work . " continue the conversation on @entity178 here fado @entity180 pubs in @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183 say they 're expecting plenty of people to forsake their professors and employers . both are tripling their staff . @entity181 general manager @entity190 is expecting about 200 people for the game , which airs there at 2 p.m. in @entity183 , general manager @entity194 said he is expecting a similar crowd . though he 's bringing in the doorman who generally works only on weekends , he 's not anticipating any problems with the crowd , he said . " we 'll just make sure the volume is loud , the @entity202 are on and we have enough staff to get everyone food and drinks , " @entity194 said . what 's the big deal anyway ? so , the uninitiated may be asking , why all the fuss over this particular game ? well , there are many storylines . the first is that it 's a derby , so there 's the longstanding city rivalry in addition to the championship implications . @entity49 's @entity218 and @entity50 's @entity219 are separated by about five miles , so you can imagine how the game divides friends , family , coworkers and neighbors . @entity226 , assistant chief executive for the @entity227 , called it " one of the most anticipated derbies this city has seen for a decade " and said those not lucky enough to get tickets , which are commanding √Ç ¬£ 1,300 ( $ 2,115 ) online , will be filling up the city 's pubs or gathering around the tv at home . police are n't expecting problems , according to a statement from superintendent @entity241 , but they 've asked local businesses to " take extra safety measures such as using plastic glasses , employing more door staff and keeping an eye on the front of house . ... people will see extra patrols . this is not because we are expecting trouble ; it is to make sure people feel safe to come and watch the match . " @entity26 's @entity102 , who has been covering @entity7 derbies for almost 40 years , said he is expecting a rowdy and raucous atmosphere . " @entity10 's going to be quite a lively place , no matter the outcome . i might bring a tin helmet like the soldiers wear , " he said with a chuckle . another reason for the hullabaloo is that both teams are insanely wealthy . for @entity49 , the reigning @entity7 champs , this is nothing new . founded in 1878 , the team boasts 19 @entity7 championships and three @entity129 crowns . @entity50 , on the other hand , has n't won the @entity7 title since 1968 and played unremarkably for the better part of four decades until @entity275 of the @entity277 royal family bought the team in 2008 . @entity49 has always been the " glamour team " with the big players , where @entity50 have been the forgettable step - relatives , and " @entity50 fans are wearily philosophical about it , " @entity102 said . " @entity50 fans are sick to death of @entity49 ruling their roost , and here 's their chance , " he said . " they will celebrate like there 's no tomorrow if they pull it off . " both teams are now among the most loaded clubs in the world . the professional services firm , @entity294 , reported that with √¢ ‚Äö ¬¨ 367 million ( $ 487 million ) , @entity49 was no. 3 in revenues last year , behind @entity298 powerhouses @entity296 and @entity299 . @entity50 came in at 11th with √¢ ‚Äö ¬¨ 170 million ( $ 225 million ) . to give you an idea what these figures mean , @entity300 reported that average revenue among @entity307 teams in 2010 was $ 261 million . @entity50 and @entity49 have used their fortunes to acquire some of the biggest soccer names in the world : @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 among them . the five dozen players on the two teams represent stars from 23 countries . " ( @entity50 ) bought a lot of talent , " said @entity43 's @entity40 . " the question is whether they bought a great team . the questions are going to remain until they win a title . " @entity325 also stoking interest in the match is soap - opera - like drama surrounding it . not only has the injection of @entity331 cash made @entity50 more competitive , but the @entity332 thrashed the @entity14 - owned @entity49 6 - 1 during their first meeting , a result @entity40 called " the most shocking result we 've seen all year . " @entity50 stood atop the @entity9 for months until march , when @entity49 seemed to find its form and took the lead . from there , it seemed a @entity49 repeat was inevitable , but in recent weeks , the tables have turned again . @entity49 has a win , loss and tie in its last three matches , while @entity50 has three wins . each team 's coach has engaged in a bit of psychological banter ahead of the fixture . @entity49 's @entity61 has prohibited his team from making statements about the game , calling it the most important derby since he took over the club in 1986 . @entity50 's @entity357 cheekily fired back that the 6 - 1 drubbing earlier this year was more important . in a strange twist , he also said his team has no chance of winning the title and went so far as to congratulate @entity49 on its championship with three games remaining . @entity357 simply knows his team performed better as underdogs this season than they did when they sat atop the table , @entity102 said . " he knows how big this game is . everything he 's been saying in the last few days , he 's trying to take pressure off his players , " he said . " it 's the lousiest piece of psychological warfare ever . " @entity49 will have to go into @entity219 , where @entity50 has n't lost all season , and snatch three points to ensure their second championship in as many years . @entity50 is three points behind @entity49 , but with a win , can take the @entity9 lead . they 'll be tied with @entity49 in the points column but will take first place because they have scored one more goal than @entity49 and given up five fewer than the @entity382 this season . though @entity50 is the favorite in the betting houses , no one seemed comfortable offering a prediction . @entity102 said his thoughts on the outcome were meaningless . " anything could happen . i 'd just urge people to watch it , " he said .	@entity20:prima donnas	@entity163:Tejash Patel	@entity26:ESPN	@entity106:ABC	@entity183:Atlanta	@entity277:Abu Dhabi	@entity135:Oregon	@entity134:Portland	@entity331:Middle Eastern	@entity275:Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan	@entity357:Mancini	@entity133:Horse Brass	@entity132:Folkerth	@entity311:Wayne Rooney	@entity170:Red Devil Parker Smith	@entity313:David Silva	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:English	@entity174:Oladeji Thompson	@entity5:Monday Night Football	@entity4:Heck	@entity178:Facebook	@entity9:Premiership	@entity194:Russell	@entity218:Old Trafford	@entity219:Etihad	@entity190:John O'Brien	@entity53:New York Giants	@entity52:New York Jets	@entity10:Manchester	@entity50:City	@entity298:Spanish	@entity56:Alabama	@entity55:Auburn	@entity54:Iron Bowl	@entity294:Deloitte	@entity74:SportsCenter	@entity296:Real Madrid	@entity70:Nwulu	@entity299:Barcelona	@entity14:Americans	@entity35:British	@entity2:Super Bowl	@entity66:The Beckham Experiment	@entity43:Sports Illustrated	@entity172:Derby	@entity102:Darke	@entity312:Sergio Aguero	@entity241:John O'Hare	@entity129:European	@entity108:World Cup	@entity202:TVs	@entity332:Blues	@entity314:Rio Ferdinand	@entity325:Topsy-turvy	@entity300:Forbes	@entity307:NFL	@entity227:Manchester City Council	@entity226:Sara Tomkins	@entity180:Irish	@entity181:Austin	@entity182:Texas	@entity165:University	@entity40:Wahl	@entity68:World 's Most Famous Athlete	@entity69:America	@entity382:Reds	@entity62:Manchester derby	@entity49:United	@entity61:Alex Ferguson
patients in @placeholder clinical trial have neural stem cells injected into spinal cord	@entity23	a little more than two years ago , @entity0 felt his left leg weakening , and he found himself quickly running out of breath . doctors first thought he had asthma , but in may 2010 they told him he probably had @entity5 , or @entity7 's disease . in august 2010 , doctors confirmed @entity0 , then 38 , had the fatal disease , and he knew it was progressing . " every month they [ doctors ] could see deterioration , " @entity0 said . @entity5 patients lose muscle function in the lungs until they can no longer breathe . most people with @entity5 die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms , according to the @entity18 . the disease causes nerves to wither and the lungs to stop working . about 10 % of @entity5 patients live 10 years or longer . @entity0 joined a clinical trial at @entity23 in @entity24 , where doctors were injecting neural stem cells -- the precursors to nerve cells -- into the lower spinal cord of @entity5 patients . before the procedure , @entity0 walked with a cane and would get winded just by walking to the mailbox . he had to quit his job as a manager for a shredding company . he was so tired he could n't play with his three children . he was too weak to pick up his youngest child . he could n't even open a @entity39 bag . @entity0 hoped the treatment would help , but he did n't expect it to . however , two weeks after getting the stem cell injections in march , he says he started to feel better . " it 's been nothing short of miraculous , " he says . " i can not begin to explain the difference it has made . " he has n't touched his cane in months , he says , and his breathing has improved . " i was afraid i would wake up and the improvements would be gone , " @entity0 said . dr. @entity50 , who is overseeing the clinical trial at @entity23 , and dr. @entity52 , who invented the surgical procedure used to inject the stem cells , explained to patients that participation in the trial would not cure or even benefit them personally , but it would help doctors learn more about how to treat als in the future . the first phase of any clinical trial is to prove that a treatment wo n't injure patients , not that the treatment works , said dr. @entity65 , who designed the clinical trial at @entity23 . the first part of the @entity5 study , sponsored by the @entity69 - based biotech company @entity68 , is designed to show that the surgical procedure to inject the stem cells into the spine is safe , and that the patients ' bodies wo n't reject them . according to researchers , the cells did not harm any of the 12 patients in the @entity23 study , nor did they accelerate the progression of their als . " i need to temper my excitement because it 's a very small patient population , " said @entity65 , president of the @entity79 . but the facts are not discouraging . she presented early data from the study monday at the neurological group 's annual meeting in @entity87 . " we have cautious optimism that a few of the patients may have slowed in their progression of lower extremity weakness , and one patient may have improved , " her report said . of the 12 patients in the trial , two have died . @entity99 's disease had progressed further than @entity0 's by the time he received the stem cell injections in 2010 . he was already in a wheelchair , and he knew participating in the clinical trial would n't cure him . but he told @entity103 in april 2010 that the only way doctors were going to figure out how to cure @entity5 was to have people willing to participate in clinical trials . " for me it just seemed like the right thing to do , " he said . @entity99 died of @entity5 in may . another patient in the study , a 39 - year old man , died of a heart attack . @entity65 said the conditions of eight of the remaining 10 patients have not changed . based on these results , she and her team in @entity116 are asking the @entity118 to allow them to move to the next part of the trial : injecting stem cells higher on the spine - into the cervical spinal cord , which is in the neck . @entity0 is optimistic that research like this will give other patients hope and lead to treatments in the future . he realizes he has n't been cured , but it 's like his clock has been set back , he says . he feels like he did when symptoms first started to appear in 2009 .

this year 's @entity10 takes place in @placeholder in november	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- the world 's leading golfers have welcomed changes to the @entity4 which will see a greater number of players share one of the sport 's bumper prize funds . the @entity4 has announced the season - ending @entity10 will boast an increased jackpot of $ 5 million to be shared between the top 15 players . that 's an increase of $ 1.25m on last year 's total , which was shared between just 10 players . the @entity10 is the climax of the race to @entity18 , the @entity4 's equivalent of the @entity21 - based @entity20 . last year @entity22 became the first golfer to win both the race to @entity18 and the @entity20 , helping the @entity26 pocket a cool $ 20m in 2013 . the world no. 3 welcomed monday 's announcement , which is designed to encourage more players to participate in the @entity30 -- the four tournaments , culminating in the @entity32 , which bring the curtain down on the @entity4 season . " it 's good to evaluate and make tweaks to any system , " @entity22 said in a statement . " these changes are for the better and wo n't cut anyone out if they do n't want to play all of the @entity30 events . " it 's down to yourself , but if you do play in all of them you are giving yourself an even better chance of winning @entity46 to @entity18 . it 's always nice to see an increase in the @entity49 as well , so i think the announcement is a good move all round . " in order to play in last year 's @entity10 , played at @entity55 , golfers had to compete in at least two of the three events prior to the @entity18 finale . that requirement has now been scrapped , a move welcomed by former world no. 2 @entity60 . " i 'm very happy with the changes and i 'm looking forward to @entity63 , " said the @entity61 . " at the end of the day , we are all working together . i 'm very happy to see that we 've reached a middle ground which should help make us all happy . " the 2013 @entity30 starts with the @entity69 on october 30 and the @entity71 event on november 9 , both set to take place in @entity73 , @entity74 . the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 on november 13 will be the penultimate tournament of the season before the @entity18 decider on november 20 .	@entity22:Stenson	@entity20:FedEx Cup	@entity21:PGA Tour	@entity26:Swede	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:European Tour	@entity55:Jumeirah Golf Estates	@entity75:Turkish Airlines Open	@entity74:China	@entity77:Turkey	@entity76:Antalya	@entity71:WGC-HSBC Champions	@entity73:Shanghai	@entity30:Final Series	@entity32:DP World Tour Championships	@entity10:DP World Tour Championship	@entity18:Dubai	@entity63:The Final Series	@entity46:The Race	@entity69:BMW Masters	@entity49:Bonus Pool	@entity60:Sergio Garcia	@entity61:Spaniard

the decision to bring @placeholder into @entity0 homes is a political maneuver , some say	@entity1	when @entity1 becomes a major @entity0 cable channel , as it plans , some @entity0 are likely to click past it , recalling the alleged anti-american tone by the @entity6 network during the @entity8 war a decade ago . " my guess is that when people hear about @entity1 , they will not be paying attention to the news quality or correspondents , " said media analyst @entity9 , a retired professor at @entity11 at @entity12 . " they will just hear @entity20 , and say it 's an @entity22 country and it 's full of terrorists and ... therefore bias in the news , " he said . the @entity20 government owns @entity1 . others , however , may find any past political slants overshadowed by a newscast striving toward @entity0 standards . viewers may be curious just to hear @entity33 , which will have access to millions of @entity0 homes now that the traditional arabic - language network this week acquired current tv , once owned by former @entity0 vice president @entity38 and others . " i think it 's a very , very well - done news network , " said media expert and former @entity42 correspondent @entity41 of @entity43 in @entity44 , where he listens to a related network , @entity46 , now available in a tiny fraction of @entity0 markets . @entity46 also is live - streamed at no cost online and provides insight into what the bigger , new @entity33 will look like , he said . the emergence of @entity1 as a major @entity0 cable network has resurrected debate about past accusations of anti-american bias during the @entity8 invasion under president @entity59 . the @entity59 administration excoriated the @entity22 peninsula 's network for broadcasting @entity64 videos . today , evidence of @entity0 antipathy at the @entity69 network has dissipated significantly , though not entirely , several analysts say . " it has obviously been demonized by our politicians for almost a decade , " said @entity70 , a former @entity71 producer and a media expert . he noted how an @entity1 cameraman was detained for six years at the @entity77 prison camp at @entity78 , @entity79 . but @entity1 's current @entity81 broadcast is " excellent , " without the bias alleged by @entity0 politicians , said @entity70 , author of the roryoconnor.org blog and a contributor to @entity1 's website . he disputed conservatives ' portrayal of @entity1 as a " terror network " and propaganda outlet . other analysts , however , say @entity1 continues to telecast content that they deem to be anti-american . " surely they will be careful in the beginning . they will try to prove that they are a professional channel that 's objective , " said @entity94 , president of the @entity95 , which has gathered several @entity1 video clips in recent years that the institute says show anti-american bias . @entity94 is a former chief counterterrorism adviser to @entity103 prime ministers @entity102 and @entity104 . " it 's much less anti-american than in the past , and the @entity81 ( broadcast ) is a soft version " of the @entity69 telecast , @entity94 continued . " but this is the government of @entity20 . it 's to discuss the government of @entity20 . it 's a policy arm of the ruler of @entity20 . " spokesmen for @entity1 could n't be reached by @entity114 for comment . in language that will surely be open for debate once @entity33 enters @entity0 homes , @entity94 used strong words in describing the @entity20 government . " @entity20 , after all , is a dictatorship , and in a dictatorship , they use media as an arm of foreign policy , be it @entity22 or @entity129 foreign policy or an international one , " he said . the @entity20 government 's decision to bring @entity1 into @entity0 homes is a provocative political maneuver -- as well as an emerging business strategy now being pursued by other government - sponsored networks , experts said . " can i note the unusual nature or essential weirdness of a former vice president of the @entity0 selling his network to an @entity22 - based network that is owned by a foreign government ? " said media expert @entity138 , host of the weekly @entity114 program " @entity141 . " @entity1 has always been regarded as something of a vanity venture by the wealthy emir of @entity20 , which is home to the world 's third largest gas reserve and is spending billions of dollars on its public image profile by sponsoring sports events at home and in @entity158 , experts said . " @entity1 has been trying and failing for years to get on television here in the @entity0 , " media writer @entity159 of @entity160 told @entity114 . " for the most part , @entity1 is buying this for the real estate because it 's beachfront real estate . " @entity41 , of @entity43 , referred to how @entity1 reportedly paid $ 500 million to acquire current tv , whose access to 60 million households is now expected to be largely transferred to @entity33 . " if you have bottomless pockets , it does n't make any difference what you pay or how you go forward , " @entity41 said . " i think the assumed price of $ 500 million is absurd for what they got . on the other hand , it makes no difference to the emir of @entity20 because it 's chump change to him . " but one cable company has balked at carrying @entity33 : @entity184 stopped carrying @entity185 upon the announcement of the @entity1 deal . a @entity184 spokeswoman said that past bias allegations against @entity1 did n't factor into the firm 's decision . analysts agreed , saying the company could be leveraging @entity33 , seeking to get a per - subscriber payment for the cable firm in exchange for carrying the channel . " this has nothing to do with politics . we treat @entity1 like any other network , " said a @entity184 spokeswoman . " we will look to gauge our customer interest in @entity33 and assess whether it is a good value for our customers . " commentary : why @entity1 has set its sites on the @entity0 @entity33 is n't an isolated phenomenon . another government - sponsored media outlet that has ventured into @entity0 broadcasting is @entity214 's @entity213 , launched last year . " the @entity214 have about a similar coverage of the @entity0 media market as @entity1 does right now , " @entity41 said . " they are using a soft diplomacy and no one is saying it 's a propaganda outlet . their approach is very thoughtful , but it 's all @entity214 and that 's what people are hungry for . " @entity41 wondered why @entity33 would plan to produce 60 % of its content in the @entity0 , as it has said , when @entity1 has increasingly become renowned for its coverage of the @entity227 , especially during the recent @entity229 revolutions . politics aside , @entity33 will find @entity0 audiences to be tough customers . the @entity22 royal - family - owned network will be entering a tumultuous , fragmented marketplace for news programming where the top - ranked cable news shows garner ratings only in the hundreds of thousands at any one time , not millions , analysts said . furthermore , access to 60 million homes does n't guarantee that many people will be watching the program , analysts said . international newscasts in particular can also be a hard sell , experts said . " a lot will depend on how much appetite there is in the @entity0 market for international news . a lot of these organizations have cut back on that , " @entity138 said . carriers " are getting hate mail from some viewers who do n't want to see it on their cable lineup , " the @entity160 ' @entity159 said about @entity1 . " but money can change a lot of these problems and they have a lot of it .

@placeholder 's archbishop @entity107 condemns the attacks	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 's police chief said monday that violence directed at foreign nationals had killed 22 people over the past week . police carry an unidentified @entity9 national on an improvised stretcher after he was badly beaten in @entity12 township . the attacks have been concentrated in @entity0 's poorest areas , and many of the victims were @entity17 who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances . the @entity20 issued a statement condemning the " senseless violence " that police say was sparked a week ago in @entity0 's @entity24 . " we join the rest of @entity1 in deploring this violence , " said @entity25 , ceo of the @entity20 , according to a statement released on monday . " whatever the underlying causes they have to be addressed , but this senseless violence is not a solution . " police said those behind the attacks accused the foreigners of stealing jobs , carrying out criminal activities and benefiting from social services -- such as free housing -- meant to benefit @entity1 . ireport.com : are you there ? send photos , video police arrested more than 200 people during the violence for offenses including rape , murder , robbery and theft . police said at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend , while others had their houses torched , their shops looted and their possessions stolen . many have sought refuge at police stations . some women have told police they were raped as part of an effort to drive the immigrants out . @entity1 's police director @entity68 said 22 people had been killed in the past week . the @entity70 estimates some 3,000 more were displaced . the attacks were concentrated in some of the poorest parts of @entity1 where locals are jobless , hungry and in need of basic services such as clean water , sanitation and housing . @entity1 president @entity79 called for an investigation into the violence . he has been reluctant to describe it as xenophobic because many @entity1 have criticized his government for not doing enough to deal with the crisis in neighboring @entity17 . @entity17 is in the midst of an economic collapse , with nearly 80 percent unemployment and inflation estimated to be at 160,000 percent . in addition , it is also in a state of political limbo . a presidential runoff between long - time leader president @entity95 and his opposition challenger @entity96 is scheduled for june 27 -- three months after the initial vote . opposition leaders have accused the government of carrying out a campaign of political intimidation ahead of the runoff . the economic and political situation has seen an influx of @entity17 to @entity1 , seeking a better life . archbishop @entity107 also condemned the violence and urged @entity1 to remember the help that he and other anti-apartheid leaders received from neighboring countries . " although they were poor , they welcomed us @entity1 as refugees , and allowed our liberation movements to have bases in their territory even if it meant those countries were going to be attacked by the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , " @entity107 said .

@placeholder captain may face charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- the captain is still in charge . no matter how technologically advanced a cruise ship may be or how modern its safety procedures or how strict the web of international regulations , passenger safety still depends on the captain 's ability to make good decisions . it 's not clear what difference more stringent regulations would have played in the decisions of captain @entity15 , who allegedly deviated from a set route , abandoned ship after the disaster with passengers still aboard and did not return to the ship to lead rescue efforts when ordered by local port officials , according to transcripts between authorities and the captain . in light of the @entity15 disaster , the new head of the @entity29 -- the @entity31 agency responsible for shipping safety , security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships . " we should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and , if necessary , re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation , " @entity29 secretary - general @entity40 said in a statement released monday . " in the centenary year of the @entity49 , we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities . " passengers first , then crew , then captain in addition to the @entity31 agency , a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies , often called " flag administration . " the ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops . ( the @entity15 did n't stop in @entity67 ports carrying @entity67 passengers , which means it was n't subject to @entity70 regulations , according to @entity71 , senior marine inspector of the @entity70 's @entity72 . ) in the @entity15 case , the laws of @entity74 also apply . @entity77 may face charges including manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , chief prosecutor @entity76 said . abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity74 , according to @entity90 , a lawyer in @entity91 , although many other countries have long abandoned it . although @entity67 law does n't single out abandoning ship as a crime , it 's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship , according to maritime law professor @entity98 , visiting professor of law at @entity99 and the @entity100 . " if you 're going to be master of a ship , your responsibility is first to your passengers , second to your crew , then you look after yourself , " said @entity98 , a @entity98 veteran . " it 's shameless and dishonorable [ for the captain ] to take himself out of the mix like that . " current international regulation under current international regulations , each cruise company must have a safety plan , called a safety management system , that details responsibilities in the event of an emergency , @entity71 said . in the event of a fire on board , the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified " muster " stations , where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency . if the incident is contained , passengers might be allowed to resume their normal activities or be kept away from the damaged part of the ship until a return to port , or they might be required to abandon ship . " the call to abandon is made by the captain , " @entity71 said . " when the abandon ship signal is made , they have 30 minutes to get everyone off the ship , even though the general emergency could have started a day or hour before . " it 's not clear to @entity150 maritime attorney @entity149 why the captain did n't issue a mayday signal to call for outside help soon after the accident . " [ a captain needs ] to know your ship and what danger your ship is in , " he said . " @entity160 and listing is a pretty good sign " of distress . passengers can be prepared while passengers have little or no control over the abilities of their captain or crew , disasters like the @entity15 are rare . still , passengers can take steps to ensure a safe trip much of the time . @entity177 recommends that @entity67 citizens who are traveling internationally register with the @entity67 @entity180 's free @entity179 ( @entity181 ) at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at @entity67 embassies or @entity67 consulates , @entity176 spokeswoman @entity175 said . this will help the @entity180 better help them during an emergency . before you board , make a copy of your passport and have a bag with necessities like hard - to - replace medication , said @entity192 , head of the @entity194 's cruise department . as soon as you board your ship and arrive at your room , find your life vest and participate in the mandatory safety drill , called a muster drill . " if you 've been on a number of cruises , you do n't pay as close attention [ to the muster drill ] as you probably should , " said @entity200 , managing editor of @entity201 . though attendance is mandatory , he said , there are often a few people who skip the drill . find out where you 'll get a life jacket if an emergency keeps you from returning to your room for yours . during the cruise , place your purse and necessities in the same place in your room every time you enter . whatever went wrong to cause or exacerbate the @entity15 cruise ship disaster , most of the @entity15 crew and passengers safely made it off the ship . and though the images of the disaster may turn off many people to cruising , experts say it 's still one of the safest transportation methods available . @entity0 's @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .	@entity29:IMO	@entity88:Spain	@entity89:Greece	@entity150:Miami	@entity232:Marnie Hunter	@entity233:Barbie Latza Nadeau	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:Cynthia Brough	@entity177:AAA Travel	@entity176:AAA	@entity179:Smart Traveler Enrollment program	@entity194:Valerie Wilson Travel	@entity192:Kimberly Wilson Wetty	@entity74:Italy	@entity77:Schettino	@entity76:Francesco Verusio	@entity71:Schoenwald	@entity70:U.S. Coast Guard	@entity72:Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise	@entity31:United Nations	@entity15:Concordia	@entity100:U.S. Coast Guard Academy	@entity99:Yale University Law School	@entity98:Coast Guard	@entity201:CruiseCritic.com	@entity200:John Deiner	@entity91:Rome	@entity90:Alessandra Batassa	@entity160:Tilting	@entity234:Hada Messia	@entity180:U.S. State Department	@entity181:STEP	@entity149:Brett Rivkind	@entity40:Koji Sekimizu	@entity67:U.S.	@entity49:Titanic

" if we play our cards right , i think we will have turned the corner of this crisis , " he said . earlier this month , @entity19 president @entity18 announced a program to buy bonds of fiscally - frail countries such as @entity23 and @entity24 . a week later , the @entity26 constitutional court green - lighted the @entity27 -- the region 's 500 billion euro ( $ 651 billion ) permanent bailout fund -- to come into force in october this year . a victory for @entity33 parties in the @entity35 elections this month was also a sign that electorates in northern @entity3 countries have not lost faith in the 17 - nation currency bloc . @entity2 told @entity40 was stuck in a " vicious cycle " between politicians , the media and the markets , which was hindering the speed of economic recovery . he said the issue was : " politicians talking loose stuff , media interpreting that loose stuff and then markets reacting to what the media reports . " @entity55 boss : @entity3 's a concern for us all @entity2 said debt - ridden countries like @entity23 and @entity24 were taking the necessary steps to reform but reiterated the @entity19 's message of conditionality in exchange for aid . he added : " i have a lot of respect for the @entity23 government because they have taken a lot of tough decisions in the past few months . " the 44 - year - old is in favor of a banking union -- a proposal from @entity76 which would give the @entity19 a supervisory role for more than 6,000 eurozone banks . but , he said , " we can not be in a situation where those banks which have taken care of their funds , have a good balance sheet , would be paying for those banks which have n't done so well .

" " it 's going to be a clash of two great nations , " he told the official @entity7 website . " there 's going to be a lot of tension in the air but hopefully everything is going to go all right . " @entity52 , who lost in the first round at @entity87 , like @entity50 is at his best on the indoor hard court surface being used in @entity13 . they will need to be with @entity15 , newly installed as world number two , leading a @entity4 team boasting @entity92 , @entity49 and doubles world number one @entity93 . @entity15 is confident of victory but also wary of @entity2 's home advantage . " given the quality of our team , it is logical to expect victory , " he told his official website . " of course , it is hard to predict what will happen there , because being a host in @entity7 matches is an advantage . @entity15 wants top spot in rankings " but , as i said , we have quality , which we 've been confirming years back and we can challenge any team on any surface in any country . i am optimistic , " he added . @entity4 knocked out the @entity115 3 - 2 in their last 16 @entity7 tie to reach the quarterfinals for the first time but @entity15 wants them to go all the way . " we have a good chance to pass the @entity2 , and i think we can go all the way to the finals , " he concluded . @entity15 opens against @entity50 in the first singles match friday , with @entity52 then playing @entity92 . in saturday 's key doubles clash , @entity2 @entity125 and @entity126 are up against @entity49 and @entity93 . in other ties , defending champions @entity128 will be without world number one and @entity87 champion @entity132 as they take on @entity133 at @entity134 . @entity128 are bidding for a hat - trick of titles while @entity133 are hampered by the loss through injury of their top - ranked player @entity139 . another absentee this week is @entity87 finalist @entity142 who misses the @entity144 's visit to @entity145 in @entity146 . @entity147 have @entity148 back for their @entity150 tie against @entity152 , who are missing injured @entity155 champ @entity154 .	@entity21:Spaladium Arena	@entity26:Australian Open	@entity28:Croat	@entity115:United States	@entity139:Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	@entity87:Wimbledon	@entity134:Clermont-Ferrand	@entity150:Moscow	@entity155:U.S. Open	@entity154:Juan Martin del Potro	@entity2:Croatia	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Davis Cup	@entity4:Serbian	@entity52:Cilic	@entity51:Mario Ancic	@entity50:Ljubicic	@entity133:France	@entity132:Rafael Nadal	@entity15:Novak Djokovic	@entity13:Split	@entity11:Yugoslavia	@entity36:Balkan	@entity152:Argentina	@entity128:Spain	@entity126:Antonio Veic	@entity125:Ivan Dodik	@entity93:Zimonjic	@entity92:Troicki	@entity144:Czech Republic	@entity145:Chile	@entity146:Coquimbo	@entity147:Russia	@entity142:Tomas Berdych	@entity148:Nikolay Davydenko	@entity40:Open Court	@entity64:Ivo Karlovic	@entity49:Tipsarevic
@entity1 's @placeholder software runs two in ten smartphones , compared to @entity52 's seven out of ten	@entity48	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the world 's most valuable company , became definitively less valuable on monday after news the global tech giant halved its orders for screens for the @entity7 . according to @entity10 's @entity9 news service , @entity1 had originally ordered 65 million @entity7 screens for the 2013 january - to - march quarter from its suppliers which include @entity10 's @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14 @entity1 's share price plunged 3.57 % to $ 501.75 -- its lowest point in 11 months -- continuing its slide from september 19 when the company 's share price hit an all - time high of $ 702.10 . investors holding 100 shares of the company on that day would have lost more than $ 20,000 after monday 's close of trading . the reports of @entity1 's cuts for lcd screens , as well as other parts , now have many fearing that demand for the @entity7 have been weaker - than - expected , according to people with knowledge of the matter . just last month , @entity36 analyst @entity35 already cut his estimate for @entity7 shipment volumes for the first quarter of 2013 , saying @entity1 had to " balance excess inventory " by cutting orders to suppliers . in the global smartphone market , @entity1 has consistently trailed its biggest rival @entity44 . fewer than two in ten smartphones that shipped in the third quarter of 2012 ran on @entity1 's @entity48 operating software , according to researcher @entity49 . in the same quarter , @entity53 's @entity52 software , which serves as @entity44 's operating platform , ran more than seven in ten smartphones around the world . in the global tablet market , @entity49 expects @entity1 will have maintained its number one position in 2012 with a 53.8 % market share -- but that is a fall from a 56.3 % share in 2011 . at the same time , @entity52 's market share is predicted to have grown from 39.8 % in 2011 to 42.7 % for 2012 . " @entity52 tablets are gaining traction in the market thanks to solid products from @entity53 , @entity70 , @entity44 , and others , " said @entity49 in a press release . to shore up some support , @entity1 's ceo @entity72 last week traveled to @entity74 for the second time in ten months -- a visit interpreted by some as an effort to fight @entity1 's falling market share in the country . @entity1 fell from fourth to sixth place in market share in the third quarter of 2012 , according to @entity49 . in his same visit , @entity72 said he expects @entity74 will eventually surpass the @entity83 as its largest market , though he did not give a time frame . " we are continuing to invest in retail stores here and will open many more over the next several years , " said @entity72 . " we have some great sites selected , our manufacturing base is here , and we have incredible partners here . so it 's a very , very important country to us . " in addition to dispatching its ceo , @entity1 is also expected to dispatch new iterations of its @entity7 and @entity97 products , perhaps as early as june or july , which may propel the company 's stock price as past launches have in the past . in the near - term , @entity1 is set to reveal earnings for its first fiscal year on january 23 . that report will include profit numbers for the first full quarter in which the @entity7 was on sale .	@entity44:Samsung	@entity1:Apple	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Sharp Corp.	@entity10:Japan	@entity9:Nikkei	@entity36:Jefferies	@entity15:South Korea	@entity49:IDC	@entity53:Google	@entity52:Android	@entity83:United States	@entity7:iPhone 5	@entity74:China	@entity97:iPad	@entity35:Peter Misek	@entity14:LG Display Co.	@entity48:iOS	@entity70:Amazon	@entity72:Tim Cook
she says @placeholder wo n't see the @entity156 athlete who endured threats to keep her home	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- if you 've been mesmerized by the drama , like millions of other viewers watching coverage of the @entity5 , you have heard the most heroic , inspirational stories of athletes reaching the pinnacle of international competition . or , at least you think you have . the truth is @entity12 viewers are missing out on the best of the @entity5 . coverage of the @entity5 in the @entity12 understandably focuses on @entity12 athletes . that is as it should be , but not to this degree . by concentrating mainly on @entity12 ' stories , the @entity20 network is depriving @entity12 viewers of some of the most fascinating , moving and exciting aspects of the @entity5 . how much have you heard , for example , about @entity27 , who marched in the opening ceremony under the banner of " @entity30 " ? @entity27 became a marathoner after running for his life since he was a young boy in @entity33 , growing up in the middle of one of the deadliest wars of the 20th century . he learned to run as he fought to escape from those who killed his siblings and relatives and later kidnapped and enslaved him . imagine such a story of tragedy and redemption , from slavery to triumph . his life is a most unbelievable odyssey , culminating at the @entity5 . his parents live in a village with no electricity or running water . he has n't spoken to them in years and hopes someone will get word to them to try to get to a television to watch their son . it 's fine to cheer for the @entity12 , but how about a cheer for @entity59 ? there 's one who deserves to become a star -- and one who should have @entity20 's cameras following him . his is not the only fascinating story at these games . @entity12 viewers are interested in the performances of @entity12 competitors . there 's nothing wrong with that , and there 's nothing wrong with @entity20 producers offering profiles , even fawning ones , of the hometown athletes . but the @entity12 public is missing out on what truly makes the @entity5 special . the only time network viewers hear about other athletes , it seems , is when there are suspicions of doping or other violations , which could potentially help @entity12 . it would seem the rest of the world is there only to serve as the rivals @entity12 require to conquer the podium . no question , the @entity12 has brilliant , talented , exciting competitors ; everyone wants to see them . but in hundreds of hours of coverage , there should be room in the spotlight , time in the schedule , for the rest of the world . in @entity20 's telling , it 's all about @entity104 and @entity105 , about @entity12 gymnasts and swimmers , and soon enough about @entity12 track stars and , ultimately , about crowning the few who will grace the @entity111 box , who will sell us subway sandwiches and @entity115 , @entity117 sneakers and @entity119 chocolate bars . it 's about manufacturing heroes because , in a truth we all know , too much of it is about making money . behind the cynicism and the commercialism , however , the games really do have the power to inspire . there truly is a history of toil and drama behind every athlete . that 's because the @entity5 are full of heroes , but they 're hardly all @entity12 . ( although a remarkable number of them do make their home in the @entity12 . ) every athlete has a story , and there are almost 15,000 athletes at @entity144 . in addition to the rivalries at the pool and the very touching images of @entity12 athletes ' parents suffering and celebrating in the stands , we would all gain from hearing more about , say , @entity154 , the lone woman in the @entity156 delegation , who endured threats and taunts to keep her out of the @entity5 . because some people in some countries , including hers , are convinced that sports are no place for women . in @entity156 , people have been killed for helping girls learn to read and write . @entity154 deserves a gold medal just for making it to the @entity5 . criticism of @entity20 's @entity12 - centric coverage of the @entity5 is nothing new . overly nationalistic narratives and neglect of non-americans are chronic problems , which attract attention every time the @entity5 roll around . from the veteran sports writer @entity178 to everyday viewers , many complain . as one blogger says , " watching the @entity5 in the @entity12 is no fun because the only thing you can watch is @entity12 winning . " @entity12 viewers , i have no doubt , would cherish the opportunity to learn more about the first women to compete for @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , who represent a country where women are not only banned from participating in sports , they 're even banned from watching sports events in major stadiums . the @entity5 would have given @entity20 an unparalleled chance to receive permission for a glimpse into the secretive @entity201 . we could have learned about the mysteries of training in the @entity205 for the two @entity201 medal - winning weightlifters , @entity208 and @entity209 . learning about how many hundreds of hours @entity105 spent at the pool , or how many pairs of shoes he has in his collection is fine . but just think what more we could be discovering . does it have to be this way ? is @entity20 just doing what viewers want ? i do n't think so . i believe @entity12 would relish the opportunity to find out about many other fascinating individuals competing at the @entity5 . during my days at @entity0 , politics caused the @entity12 and the @entity223 to boycott each others ' olympics . @entity0 founder @entity226 , my former boss , decided to create his own @entity5 , staging the @entity227 over a span of 16 years . @entity0 producers and camera crews traveled the world to produce profiles of the men and women who would participate in @entity226 's most excellent sports adventure . the profiles were unforgettable . @entity12 may be missing out on some of the best of the @entity5 . fortunately , the rest of the world is not . as @entity156 's @entity154 said , " there are a lot of @entity156 girls and women [ who are ] watching me and they hope that one day they shall be [ in my place ] . and i am going to open a new way for the women of @entity156 . " one day , perhaps , @entity12 , too , will have the opportunity to gain inspiration from athletes like her , whose journey deserves more attention , even if she does not compete for the @entity12 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .	@entity20:NBC	@entity27:Marial	@entity117:Nike	@entity115:Gatorade	@entity255:Frida Ghitis	@entity111:Wheaties	@entity257:Frida Ghitis	@entity156:Afghan	@entity119:Snickers	@entity154:Kohistani	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Olympic	@entity178:Frank Deford	@entity191:Sarah Attar	@entity190:Wojdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani	@entity59:Marial	@entity30:Independent Olympic Athletes	@entity33:Sudanese	@entity12:Americans	@entity209:Om Yun Chol	@entity208:Kim Un Guk	@entity104:Michael Phelps	@entity105:Lochte	@entity201:North Korean	@entity261:Ghitis	@entity205:Hermit Kingdom	@entity144:London 2012	@entity189:Saudi Arabia	@entity223:Soviet Union	@entity227:Goodwill Games	@entity226:Ted
the result spoils the debut of new @placeholder manager @entity11 following his switch from @entity34	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 moved to within three points of leaders @entity4 at the top of the @entity6 after @entity7 inspired them to a 2 - 0 victory at @entity9 to spoil new manager @entity11 's first match in charge . captain @entity7 produced an impressive display on his return from a hamstring injury and scored his 10th league goal of the season in the 28th minute after a neat one - two with @entity18 . his surging run then led to substitute and fellow - @entity20 @entity19 scoring the second 12 minutes from time as former @entity22 player @entity11 's reign at the @entity23 got off to a losing start . with these two teams due to meet in the return fixture at the @entity29 on wednesday , @entity26 's side could well take over at the top of the table in the next few days . @entity9 remain second from bottom , with @entity11 having swapped one relegation battle with @entity34 for another . earlier in the day , @entity37 captain @entity36 put the seal on his side 's long - awaited return to winning ways as they overcame @entity42 2 - 0 at @entity43 . @entity36 applied the finish to @entity46 's 54th - minute free - kick to put rovers within touching distance of their first three - point haul since november . defender @entity51 had earlier settled the home side 's nerves with a fortuitous 24th - minute opener after he ricocheted home an attempted clearance by former @entity37 winger @entity57 . in the day 's other match , @entity58 failed to cash in on slip - ups by their @entity62 - chasing rivals after being held 0 - 0 at home by @entity64 . @entity58 could have closed the gap on the top four after @entity66 , beaten at @entity67 , and @entity68 , held at home by @entity70 , both dropped points on saturday . but a combination of a below - par performance and some fine saves by @entity76 meant they had to settle for their first goalless draw of the league campaign .	@entity22:Wanderers	@entity23:Reebok Stadium	@entity20:Spaniard	@entity26:Arsene Wenger	@entity29:Emirates Stadium	@entity42:Fulham	@entity1:Arsenal	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Cesc Fabregas	@entity6:English Premier League	@entity4:Chelsea	@entity9:Bolton	@entity51:Chris Samba	@entity57:Damien Duff	@entity76:Robert Green	@entity70:Hull	@entity34:Burnley	@entity11:Owen Coyle	@entity36:Nelsen	@entity19:Fran Merida	@entity18:Eduardo	@entity58:Villa	@entity37:Blackburn	@entity46:Benni McCarthy	@entity68:Tottenham	@entity43:Ewood Park	@entity66:Manchester City	@entity67:Everton	@entity64:West Ham	@entity62:Champions League

students harrassed her on @entity73 and started " @placeholder " online	@entity75	( @entity0 ) -- at age 13 , @entity1 struggled in middle school . not because her class work at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , was challenging , but because @entity7 was being bullied . her friend , @entity8 , told @entity0 that fellow students would " walk up to her and call her ' slut , ' ' whore , ' and they would sometimes , they would call her ' skank ' and just be really cruel to her . " another friend , @entity23 , said , " we had to make like a wall , we had people surrounding her , and she had to be in the middle because people would come by and try to hit her and push her into a locker or something . " she was afraid to walk alone , she was afraid someone would do something to her , like verbally attack her , so she would always have someone with her , " @entity23 added . this all started in the spring of 2009 during the last week of school . friends and family say @entity7 had " sexted " a picture of her breasts to her boyfriend . another girl from school , they say , got her hands on the photo and sent it to students at six different schools in the area . before @entity7 could do anything to stop it , that photo had gone viral . the school alerted @entity7 's parents . her mother , @entity47 , told @entity0 how she learned about the photo . " the assistant principal had a meeting with my husband and i and pretty much told us that he did not see the image but that he had heard that it was @entity7 and when he confronted @entity7 , @entity7 did not deny it . she was n't proud of it but she did n't lie , " @entity7 's mother said . mrs. @entity1 says she had warned her daughter about the dark side of technology , about " some of the pretty sexual images of young girls and guys . " she added , " @entity7 was very aware of that , of inappropriate dress and most definitely posing . " still , because of that photo , @entity7 had become a target for 11 - , 12 - , and 13 - year - old bullies . but she did n't share her pain with her parents . even when bullies wrote horrible things about @entity7 on a @entity73 page called the " @entity74 " and started a " @entity75 , " the young girl kept silent . @entity77 provided a bit of a break , but when the new school year began , the taunting was even worse . on saturday , september 12 , 2009 , @entity1 helped her father mow the lawn . they cooked a special seafood dinner together as a family . then @entity7 disappeared to her room upstairs . her parents stayed downstairs and watched tv . @entity47 will never forget the moment she went to say goodnight to her daughter . " i went upstairs to go in her room and kiss her goodnight . that was when i found her . i screamed for my husband . and started doing cpr . " it was too late . @entity7 was already dead . she had used her favorite scarves to hang herself from her canopy bed . after @entity7 died , her mother learned her daughter had been summoned to meet with a school social worker . a spokesperson for the school says the social worker was concerned @entity7 might have been trying to hurt herself , so she had @entity7 sign what 's called a " no harm " contract in which @entity7 agreed to talk to an adult if she wanted to harm herself . @entity7 's mother says she was never told about the contract , which she found crumpled up in the garbage in her daughter 's bedroom after she died . school officials told @entity0 they believed the social worker had tried calling @entity7 's mother to alert her but were n't sure if she had left a message . " the school dropped the ball , " @entity47 said . " the school did not call . we have the digital telephone ; we have the cell phones that indicate when there was an incoming call and what number was calling in . we have a house phone , i have a cell phone , my husband has a cell phone . we have emergency contact numbers at the school which was my sister - in - law and her husband . there was no indication that the school called any of those numbers , " @entity7 's mother said . days after @entity7 died , her older sister , @entity139 , discovered the bullying was still going on . even in death , @entity7 could not escape it . " i knew she had @entity73 and @entity144 . there were people putting comments on there : ' did @entity7 really kill herself ? ' ' i ca n't believe that whore did that . ' just obscene things that i would never expect from a 12 - year - old or a 13 - year - old , " said @entity139 . in the year or so that has passed since @entity1 took her own life , her mother has started a group called @entity7 's @entity158 . she hopes it will help combat bullying and save other moms from feeling the horrendous pain that she feels . @entity47 has a message for parents : " it happened to my daughter , it can happen to yours too . no one is untouchable . no one is untouchable .

@entity11 : time not on the side of @entity3 regime that 's suppressing @placeholder protesters	@entity27	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a new report saying that @entity3 could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon is a major development , but not one that should lead the @entity7 to consider a military strike against the @entity10 regime , according to analyst @entity11 . the draft report , obtained by @entity1 and not yet approved by the @entity14 's board of governors , is the @entity17 nuclear watchdog agency 's strongest warning yet that @entity3 could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb . @entity11 told @entity1 the report should spur @entity7 diplomacy to prevent @entity3 from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the @entity7 government of a potential military strike against @entity3 was wrongheaded . " to be casually talking about military action because we 're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous , " he said . @entity3 's @entity27 of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits , @entity11 said . " at the end of the day , time is not on the side of this regime . it 's a dysfunctional regime that has run the economy into the ground , taken a great and open and proud nation and turned it into a kind of paranoid and closed one and which is clearly losing the support of young @entity3 by the day . " @entity11 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity44 , " spoke to @entity1 on thursday . @entity1 : the @entity14 has done a report saying that @entity3 could be at work on building a nuclear weapon . what do you think that means ? @entity11 : that 's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether @entity3 has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons . we know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites . but it has always seemed as though there were two views within the @entity3 leadership . one was that @entity3 should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the @entity69 . there are clearly others in @entity3 who believe that @entity3 should simply have nuclear weapons . ... this would suggest that the harder line faction within @entity3 is winning out . we do n't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly . ... @entity1 : what 's happening with the negotiations ? @entity11 : the @entity3 have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith . ... they rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they 're playing games . @entity1 : what 's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions ? @entity11 : it probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with @entity3 and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere . i also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the @entity98 within the regime , which seems to be most powerful faction . and that 's the right approach to take . we know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average @entity3 , and that is entirely counterproductive . @entity1 : what 's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside @entity3 , including the protest movement ? @entity11 : nobody knows for sure , but it does seem to have confused the situation internally . [ @entity3 president @entity113 ] @entity112 had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue , which were then attacked by the opposition , and he retracted it , which suggests that he 's feeling the pressure . it suggests that there are divisions within the regime , there 's some sense of vulnerability . ... it just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them , but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in @entity3 . @entity1 : what do you think about the military option ? @entity11 : the problems with the military option remain what they 've always been , and it 's a little alarming to see the way in which people are gravitating toward a military option , out of a sort of frustration that there is n't some magical solution here . the military option is certainly not a magical solution . it 's a very risky strategy with many potentially large , unintended consequences . a military strike would be a pre-emptive invasion of another country by the @entity7 . it would not have any sanction in international law . it would not be supported by the vast majority of the world , and it would only delay rather than destroy the @entity3 program . i 've talked to many military experts , and we do not seem to have the ability to completely destroy a program like this , partly because nuclear technology is after all not some cutting - edge technology . this is 60 - year old technology , and there are lots of people in @entity3 who are trained scientists . it would also strengthen the hard - line elements within the regime , would weaken the @entity27 because they would have to come out in support of the regime , and against what would be a foreign attack on @entity3 soil . it would inflame the @entity183 and make tensions rise everywhere , including the two places where the @entity7 has a huge stake and tens of thousands of troops -- @entity188 and @entity189 -- and it would put the moderate @entity191 on the defense . it would have the effect of radicalizing the region . and those are pretty much the known consequences . ... then , there 's always in the business of war , the unknown consequences . what would @entity3 's reaction be ? ... what kind of militia operations could it fund in @entity189 and @entity188 that would directly kill @entity7 ? @entity1 : do you think the administration is seriously contemplating military action ? @entity11 : i do n't think the administration is seriously contemplating it , but i 'm struck by the degree to which many outside commentators are doing it , and the danger is ... that the administration places itself in a box where it says things which leave it no option but to keep taking a harder and harder line . i do n't think it 's likely , but i do worry that there is a train which is leaving the station , which might end up in a military strike . @entity1 : do you think secretary of state @entity228 has been sounding the right note ? @entity11 : absolutely . secretary @entity228 has been sounding the right note and being tough , making the point that they 're willing to engage with the @entity3 if they are serious . i also think this most recent declaration by @entity14 will make it easier for us to continue building a containment strategy against @entity3 , getting moderate @entity191 countries to ally with the @entity7 , tacitly with @entity237 and against @entity3 politically and militarily within the region , get the @entity239 even more strongly on board and most crucially get the @entity241 and the @entity242 on board for sanctions in the @entity17 -- further , tighter and tougher sanctions . @entity1 : aside from sanctions and watchful waiting , is there anything else that should be done ? @entity11 : i think we should be supporting the @entity27 in @entity3 . i do n't think we need to do it in a dramatic and overt kind of way , which would probably be counterproductive . but there are ways in word and deed that the @entity7 could make clear that we support the aspirations of those @entity3 who want a more normal @entity3 , a more open democratic @entity3 , more engaged with the world . that is not inconsistent with us saying we want to negotiate with @entity3 . we did that with the @entity263 . if there was a way for us to construct a containment strategy that at the same time left room for negotiations on the one hand and also left room for us to express our hopes and support for a different @entity3 in the future , that would be the best long - term strategy for us . ... it 's difficult to predict when and where things will change , but it 's difficult to imagine that 25 years from now @entity3 will still be run by this unholy alliance of a bunch of reactionary mullahs and power - hungry military leaders .	@entity27:Green Movement	@entity113:Mahmoud	@entity112:Ahmadinejad	@entity3:Iranian	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:New York	@entity7:United States	@entity237:Israel	@entity239:Europeans	@entity191:Arab	@entity17:U.N.	@entity14:IAEA	@entity11:Zakaria	@entity10:Tehran	@entity242:Chinese	@entity241:Russians	@entity98:Republican Guard	@entity263:Soviet Union	@entity188:Afghanistan	@entity189:Iraq	@entity228:Clinton	@entity183:Middle East	@entity44:Fareed Zakaria GPS	@entity69:Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
he says @placeholder thought education , health reform could stem social decline	@entity7	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- when people say the message of @entity7 ' " @entity6 " is as relevant today as it was in 1843 , they usually have in mind @entity9 's conversion . overnight , he 's transformed from a mean old skinflint who believes that those unable to support themselves had better die " and decrease the surplus population " to an almost riotously generous giver to charitable causes . they remember especially , perhaps , @entity9 's change of heart toward his poor , underpaid clerk @entity20 and how he promises to ensure that @entity20 will be able to afford the medical treatment that his beloved little son , the crippled @entity22 , will need if he is to survive -- a plot detail that resonates with particular strength in @entity25 today , where citizens struggle with health care costs . less often remembered , though , is an eerie interlude that can easily be taken as a mirror of our own times : @entity9 's appalled encounter with the two fearful children , a boy and a girl , " yellow , meagre , ragged , scowling , wolfish , " who emerge from the robes of the @entity39 . the boy 's name is @entity42 and the girl 's is want , and the ghost warns @entity9 to beware of them both -- but especially of the boy on whose brow is written " that which is @entity48 , unless the writing be erased . " these fearful apparitions were products of @entity53 's " @entity52 , " when there was widespread economic distress and great fear of social breakdown , but it is part of @entity7 ' genius that he was recognizing here a theme that plays out everywhere , in every time and in every culture . it certainly does in today 's @entity25 with unemployment running at 10 percent ( or even higher in some areas ) and fears that this could lead to increased crime , and arguably has led to a growing sense of intolerance -- for example , towards immigrant communities -- and political extremism . it may seem odd to include such grim reminders in a tale about @entity77 . but @entity7 knew about poverty : his own comfortable childhood was transformed when his father 's overspending landed him and most of his family in a debtors ' prison . as a boy , @entity7 worked long hours for about a year in a small - scale factory and later drew on this experience , to him deeply degrading , in the early chapters of " @entity88 . " when not working he wandered about the streets of @entity0 , which he was later so richly to describe in " @entity90 " and his other great novels . for @entity7 , building a system of national education ( something frustrated in his day by bitter disputes between the different religious denominations ) and reforming sanitary ( or public health ) laws were the two things needing urgent attention from the nation 's lawmakers . he continued to fear the danger represented by the boy @entity106 , who re-appears in the last of his @entity77 books , " @entity110 " ( 1848 ) , as the savage street - child whom @entity109 , the protagonist , tries vainly to help . of course , things gradually improved for @entity53 , as they eventually do in most big countries struggling to survive economic lows . in the 1850s and 1860s , as the country became more prosperous , the fear of chaos and revolution receded . @entity7 dropped @entity42 and want from his hugely popular public reading version of the " @entity120 " ( performed from 1858 onward ) , though he never stopped calling attention to the national scandal of the scavenging hordes of starving , uncared - for street children in @entity0 and @entity53 's other great cities ( the first @entity127 , which brought in compulsory state education at the elementary level for all working - class children , was passed in the year of his death ) . today , however , cities still confront gang activity and , as we witness a surge of political and religious extremism , we might wonder what @entity7 would make of the situation . as someone who sought in his own journals to fight against the depraving effect of cheap sensational literature produced by those he called " @entity146 to the basest passions of the lowest natures , " he would certainly have been alarmed and horrified by the level of pop culture violence and quasi-pornography -- on tv , in magazines and video games . he would have seen this primarily as a failure of public education , i believe . again , as someone who in his last novel , " @entity160 , " depicted a drug addict who turns to murder , he would have been equally appalled by the drug culture now so widespread among the young . the powerful presentation of @entity42 and want in the latest cinematic version of his immortal " @entity6 " would surely have struck him appropriate for our day . in the new @entity168 film a ferociously scowling @entity42 wields a lethal - looking knife , and want is a teenage prostitute driven crazy , presumably by drug abuse . @entity168 brilliantly demonstrates that the urgent social warning @entity7 sought to convey in the " @entity174 " in 1843 is quite as relevant to us today as is the story 's more personal message about the need for us to open our " shut - up hearts " to our fellow men and give generously to those less well off than ourselves . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184	@entity22:Tiny Tim	@entity20:Bob	@entity25:America	@entity110:The Haunted Man	@entity88:David Copperfield	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:England	@entity0:London	@entity7:Dickens	@entity174:Carol	@entity6:A Christmas Carol	@entity9:Scrooge	@entity53:Britain	@entity52:Hungry Forties	@entity77:Christmas	@entity39:Ghost of Christmas Present	@entity160:Edwin Drood	@entity106:Ignorance	@entity127:Education Act	@entity120:Carol	@entity90:Bleak House	@entity146:Panders	@entity168:Disney	@entity184:Slater	@entity42:Ignorance	@entity48:Doom	@entity109:Redlaw

@placeholder - born @entity10 designed @entity8 's new @entity13 , due to debut in 2017	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- what happens when you ask a super-car designer to create a super luxurious train ? @entity5 , judging by the above images released by @entity9 rail company @entity8 . @entity11 - born @entity10 , well known in automobile design circles , was brought in to style the company 's super slick new @entity13 , due to start chugging down the tracks in spring 2017 . holding a maximum of 34 passengers , the @entity13 will have 10 carriages made up of five suites , one deluxe suite , two glass - walled observation cars , a dining car and lounge . @entity10 has worked as a chief designer for @entity25 , a senior designer for @entity27 and design director for @entity29 , the company behind the @entity30 and @entity31 . according to his company , @entity33 , he wanted to create a train that would allow passengers " to appreciate the flow of the time and space , " while enjoying @entity9 's landscapes and culture throughout the journey . one of the more unique features is the observation carriage at the front of the train , which allows passengers to see onto the tracks ahead . the other observation car is at the end of the train . @entity50 says the train will be fitted with furniture that conveys the nobility of traditional @entity9 culture . @entity56 , for instance , is wrapped in graceful curves and features decor inspired by trees . all suites will have a private bathroom with a shower and toilet , but the top sleeping space is the split level deluxe suite , which sleeps four . on the bottom are two double beds , on the top a traditional @entity9 dining area , with seats on the floor . the train will be able to run on both electric and non-electric rails . ca n't wait till 2017 ? @entity8 's upcoming @entity13 wo n't be the first @entity9 train to take the super-luxury route . @entity79 's @entity78 train , which features @entity9 and @entity81 design elements , hit the tracks in the fall of 2013 . this one only travels through the island of @entity85 and has 14 luxury guest rooms , two deluxe suites , three presidential suites , a lounge car , dining car and bar . guests can choose either the two - or three - night experience . the name " @entity78 " represents the seven prefectures of @entity85 , the seven carriages of the train and the seven main tourist attractions of the island ( nature , cuisine , hot springs , history / culture , spiritual sites , local hospitality and sightseeing ) . those who want to take a @entity109 journey need to apply online . prices start from √Ç ¬• 180,000 ( $ 1,765 ) per person for the two - night trip . no first come first serve here . the company says that in the event that applications exceed available places , a lottery will be conducted to select participants .	@entity31:Maserati	@entity30:Ferrari	@entity33:Ken Okuyama Design	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Cruise Train	@entity11:Yamagata	@entity5:Magic	@entity25:General Motors	@entity9:Japanese	@entity10:Okuyama	@entity27:Porshe	@entity81:Western	@entity50:JR Rail	@entity79:JR Kyushu	@entity85:Kyushu	@entity29:Pininfarina	@entity109:Seven Stars	@entity8:JR East	@entity78:Seven Stars	@entity56:The Lounge
growing supply of consultants in @entity0 helping students apply to @placeholder schools	@entity17	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- how much would you pay to get your child into an @entity5 university ? for @entity7 and @entity8 , it seems the sky was the limit . in 2007 , the @entity0 couple enlisted harvard - lecturer - turned - admissions - consultant @entity12 to steer their two sons through elite @entity17 boarding schools into a top - ranked university -- preferably @entity19 . for a monthly $ 4000 fee per child , their " total education management " package included extensive admissions counseling , arranging homestays , private tutoring , and extra-curricular activities , whereby @entity12 and his team functioned as " parents away from parents " for their sons . the @entity34 later switched to a retainer of $ 1 million per child . but in 2010 , before their sons applied to university , the @entity34 sued @entity12 to recover their $ 2 million retainer , alleging fraud , breach of conduct , and unjust enrichment , according to court documents . @entity12 denied any wrongdoing to @entity1 , alleging the @entity34 sought to end their relationship after " poaching " one of his contract staff as a cheaper replacement . admissions consultants say the @entity52 case is an anomaly , both in terms of the amount the couple paid and the assurances @entity12 allegedly made . but it highlights the strong appetite among the wealthiest in @entity0 for elite @entity17 education and the nebulous role that a burgeoning flock of consultants play in the process . @entity0 is the 16th leading place of origin for international enrollment at @entity17 colleges and universities , according to the @entity70 , with its students increasing 1.3 % to 8,136 in the 2010 - 11 academic year . " when people are looking at the @entity17 education system , it 's seen as one of the best in the world , " said @entity72 , an @entity17 who moved to @entity0 in 2005 and quickly identified admissions consulting as a business opportunity . " everybody was talking about top @entity17 colleges -- it was clearly something that was very important to a lot of people , something that was very well - respected , " she added . " especially when you send your children to the @entity17 , you want them to develop critical and creative thinking skills , " she explained , adding that an @entity17 degree is seen by @entity91 as providing " increased opportunities for their children throughout the rest of their lives . " since setting up her firm , @entity72 said a wealth of new or expanded consultancies have cropped up , particularly ones offering comprehensive packages that not only encompass preparation for the standardized admission exam ( @entity103 ) , but also services like tutoring and debate training . some consultancies , such as @entity108 , begin grooming students as early as in eighth grade ( around ages 13 - 14 ) , giving them " a well - built resume that does n't spike in their final year ( before entering university ) , " said @entity108 's founder , @entity115 . " before as an admissions consultant ( in @entity0 ) , you could work part - time and do it out of @entity118 . now most companies have a full - time staff , they have their own offices , and it 's all - year - round support , " @entity115 said , citing his annual client base as growing from four to up to 40 students . affluent @entity125 families view elite @entity17 education as a form of conspicuous consumption and are willing to " throw money at it , " @entity12 said , describing his clients as " the 1 % of the 1 % . " case in point : @entity52 is a member of the family that owns the @entity136 jewelry empire in @entity0 . most parents who seek @entity108 's services are investment bank partners , lawyers , or entrepreneurs , @entity115 said , quoting fees of $ 6,450 - $ 19,350 for a one - year package . @entity72 said her clients have varying income backgrounds , but they all prioritize their children 's education . she quoted her average yearly fee as $ 3,225 - $ 7,750 . while international students may genuinely need help navigating the unfamiliar terrain of the @entity17 application process , the @entity52 case raises the specter of the unscrupulous consultant -- in an unregulated profession . the @entity17 - based @entity157 ( @entity157 ) denounced @entity12 as a " con artist , " describing the monthly $ 8,000 fees for the two @entity34 sons as approximating " what should be a single fee , over a multi-year period , to work comprehensively with a student . " it pointed out that @entity12 's communications with the @entity34 " were all about ' getting in , ' " saying that success should be measured by a student 's university experience , not admission . " the thing i worry about consultants is they can do a lot of work in terms of writing essays and it 's unethical , " said @entity170 , a lecturer at @entity171 in @entity172 who specializes in higher education admissions policy . " but it 's good if they 're helping students find a good fit and what they want in a college , rather than how can we game the system to get into the school we want ? " @entity19 was even less enthusiastic . " while it is certainly possible that in individual cases an admissions consultant can be helpful to an applicant , we have encountered no evidence to indicate that is the case generally , " said spokesperson @entity191 . @entity72 said competition for places at top schools had become fierce . " students , who ten years ago would have gotten into @entity19 , @entity203 , and @entity204 , might not be able to now , " she said . to gain an edge , some wealthy applicants offer donations to boarding schools and universities , consultants said . in their lawsuit , the @entity34 claim @entity12 convinced them that elite schools unofficially expected donations from foreign applicants . through their lawyer , the @entity34 declined to comment on the pending case . while donations are " not an absolute requirement , " @entity12 told @entity1 , they are a " common practice " that can pivotally influence boarding school and university admissions . e-mails submitted to the court reveal extensive discussions between @entity226 and @entity227 boarding school officials over the 2007 - 08 academic year , regarding the wealth and likelihood of donations from the @entity34 . boarding schools conduct " intensive screening of applicants so they can assess who has the potential to donate money once the child is admitted , and then the development directors work feverishly to court the constituencies , " @entity12 said . @entity227 denied conducting " financial screenings of any applicants except for those applying for financial aid , although on occasion we become aware of a prospective family 's history of or capacity for philanthropic support , " according to its director of development , @entity249 , who exchanged numerous e-mails with @entity12 . @entity12 said he also personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to @entity227 to " advance the prospects " of the @entity52 sons -- as well as his future clients . he added that these donations were factored into his $ 250,000 " extraordinary admission fee " charged in successful cases that required extensive lobbying . while @entity249 confirmed that @entity12 made several gifts to the school , he said they were unrelated to the @entity52 sons , adding that " no donation or promise of donation was made to @entity227 by the @entity34 or mr. @entity12 on their behalf , as part of the admission process . " he said donations were neither common nor pivotally influential in admissions decisions . in march 2008 , the @entity52 sons were admitted to @entity227 -- a decision @entity270 said was merited , given their " academic records , extracurricular involvement , and leadership potential . " @entity12 attributed their admission to his donations , saying that the sons ' secondary school admission test scores ( @entity279 ) were weak . he said he had stopped working with the @entity52 sons before they applied to university . @entity12 said his services can also include brokering introduction meetings between potential donors from @entity284 and development officials at @entity17 universities , adding that schools welcomed these introductions as a way of fielding multitudes of donation requests . in his view , " money is money , whether it 's coming from a random family in @entity0 or a fifth - generation @entity294 applying to @entity204 . " he added that donations have to be presented " in a way that does n't look like quid pro quo . " consultant @entity72 disagreed , saying she has heard of donations making a significant difference in admissions decisions only in " development cases , " which involve families with multiple generations of alumni that have made significant donations over the years . @entity19 declined to comment on whether donations influence admissions decisions . the @entity157 said " no educational consultant will act as a middleman for donations to a school , " adding that consultants " will put the family directly in touch with a university 's development office and donations would be made directly . " but the appetite among @entity0 's elite for getting their offspring into top universities is unlikely to fade . " the way to differentiate yourself is " that one line on your resume that says what university you came from , " @entity108 's @entity115 said . " that 's one of the few elements that sticks with you for the rest of your life professionally .

eleven months later , @entity25 destroys @placeholder 's @entity15	@entity0	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 . @entity3 keeps in his cabin a memento of the last time the storied @entity7 destroyer cruised into @entity8 . it was @entity10 2000 . sailors stood at the rails under a fluttering @entity14 flag . in the background , the @entity15 soared over a shimmering skyline . " it reminds me of why we go to sea , " @entity18 says of the keepsake photo . a few months later , on october 12 , 2000 , a pair of suicide bombers associated with @entity25 nearly sank the @entity26 as it refueled in @entity28 harbor in @entity29 . the attackers waved at the sailors . " it was presumed to be a trash boat , " @entity18 says . " it was n't . " resilient and strong the bombers sidled their explosives - laden fishing boat alongside the $ 1 billion warship and ripped a 40 - by - 60 - foot hole into its side , killing 17 sailors and wounding 37 more . heralded by @entity25 as one of its greatest military strikes , the attack foreshadowed the terror network 's destruction of the @entity15 in @entity48 less than a year later . " we took a hit 11 months before 9/11 , and we came back resilient , a strong force , " @entity18 says , " like the men and women of @entity0 . " the destroyer -- also known as @entity26 -- left @entity0 on tuesday at the close of @entity10 2014 . the @entity15 site , with its hulking @entity57 , once again houses the nation 's tallest building . on wednesday , the same day the @entity26 headed the @entity10 procession along the harbor , the long - awaited september 11 @entity62 opened to the public . a flotilla of smaller vessels , including @entity66 and @entity68 boats , welcomed the ships . " we 're so closely connected to the men and women of @entity0 , " says @entity18 , a native of @entity70 , @entity71 . " you see the outpouring of the emergency service members , the firefighters and the @entity66 . " in recent days , hundreds of schoolchildren and adults toured the @entity26 to learn about its history , weapons systems and return to duty two years and $ 250 million in repairs and upgrades after the attack . " right here is where the gash was , " says @entity7 @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 , standing near where 17 sailors having an early lunch were killed . victims remembered nearby , in the ship 's @entity98 , 17 gold stars are inlaid on the mess deck to commemorate each victim . " the sailors , you watch them when they 're getting their chow , they do n't step on those stars , " @entity18 says . " they walk around them . and sailors are assigned to clean those stars every day . they take that very seriously . " each victim is remembered on a plaque : -- @entity115 2nd @entity114 , 21 . -- electronics technician chief petty officer @entity116 , 35 . -- @entity118 @entity117 , 19 . -- information systems technician @entity119 , 21 . -- signalman seaman @entity121 , 22 . -- seaman @entity122 , 19 . -- engineman 2nd @entity124 @entity123 , 24 . -- @entity126 2nd @entity125 , 24 . -- seaman @entity127 , 22 . -- engineman fireman @entity128 , 19 . -- fireman @entity129 , 19 . -- @entity131 @entity130 , 30 . -- @entity133 3rd @entity132 , 22 . -- operations specialist 2nd @entity134 , 32 . -- fireman @entity135 , 26 . -- @entity88 @entity136 , 31 . -- seaman @entity137 , 19 . in addition , placards with photos and short biographies about the victims are displayed near their workstations . " every single day you remember what those sailors died for , " @entity88 says . in the dining hall , the attack is commemorated with three glass cases . one has the still blackened flag that flew the day of the attack . another , the flag that draped the coffins of the fallen crew members . a third holds the flag flown when the ship first returned to the @entity157 . courage and heroism in 2001 , the @entity160 issued a report on the @entity26 attack that cited significant shortcomings in security against terrorist attacks . " the investigation clearly shows that the commanding officer of @entity26 did not have the specific intelligence , focused training , appropriate equipment or on - scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined , preplanned assault , " the @entity166 , adm. @entity167 , said at the time . " in short , the system -- all of us -- did not equip this @entity177 for success in the environment he encountered in @entity28 harbor that fateful day . " the terror organization 's success against the @entity26 " galvanized @entity25 's recruitment efforts , " while the failure of the @entity14 to retaliate against group leaders in @entity187 motivated @entity189 to " launch something bigger , " said the @entity181 . still , those stationed on the @entity26 speak of the heroism of members of the former crew , who worked for days to save the ship and care for the injured . in intense heat , they toiled without electrical power and no shipboard communication . " on two occasions , it was very , very close to sinking , " @entity18 says . " the ship had to pull together everybody regardless of what their specialty was ... for damage control . " he added , " there is no question that this ship was saved by the men and women who were serving on the @entity26 in october 2000 . that 's not lost on me or any of my crew members . we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us . " all @entity7 recruits now undergo drills on the same type of ship as the @entity26 , putting out fires , dealing with flooding and tending to the wounded . exercises occur in a structural model of the damaged @entity26 mess deck . " we have a totally different mindset of how we do business , a totally different focus , " @entity18 says . said @entity88 , " there 's not really a drill that you can do for something that massive . even when you have an actual fire or flooding , it 's not nearly that bad . it would have taken a lot of courage and heroism to do what they did .

@placeholder manager unhappy with @entity2 's $ 114 million outlay on two players	@entity40	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's big spending on @entity4 's transfer deadline day has been criticized by one of the club 's @entity7 rivals , who questioned how the @entity11 champions can meet @entity4 's new financial fair - play rules . the @entity14 team announced a loss of $ 113 million on monday for the year ended june 30 , 2010 -- but then smashed the @entity17 transfer record with a reported $ 80 million acquisition of @entity20 striker @entity19 , and also laid out $ 34 million for @entity22 defender @entity21 . the @entity19 deal allowed his former club @entity24 to spend $ 55 million on @entity27 's relatively unproven @entity26 striker @entity25 , who is injured , and $ 36 million on @entity28 forward @entity29 . however , @entity31 football 's governing body @entity4 will take sanctions against clubs who can not balance their books by the end of the 2012 reporting period . the best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day @entity2 's @entity14 rivals @entity40 were again quiet in the january transfer window , and manager @entity42 questioned the tactics of the @entity47 ' billionaire @entity45 owner @entity44 . " @entity2 supported @entity4 's financial fair - play proposals but in the morning they announced a ¬£ 70 million loss and in the afternoon they buy ¬£ 75 million worth of players . where 's the logic in that ? " he told reporters after tuesday 's 2 - 1 @entity11 win over @entity54 . " it 's hard to guess . officially they vote for financial fair play , but they can explain why they have done this much better than i can . @entity44 can tell you why , but that 's how you can read it from the outside . " if you do n't invest for a while , it looks as if you 're not as involved in it anymore , that he does n't like it as much . but ¬£ 75 million means more will come . " @entity44 was a bit in no - man 's land where nobody could guess if he wanted to still invest or not . he has been like that for a long time , but that has changed . he has decided to put big money in again and that tells you in the summer more will come . he is back to full investment . " @entity82 , vice-president of @entity84 club @entity83 , also criticized the level of spending in @entity26 -- which reached a record $ 363 million . " everyone 's talking about balancing the books but then they spend like crazy people , " he told reporters . " @entity2 strengthened in an amazing way , spending 80 million euros . i just do n't know where financial sense will end up . " @entity2 sign @entity19 and @entity21 in frantic end to deadline day @entity2 dressed up the club 's financial results by saying they were " cash positive " with a net inflow of ¬£ 3.8 million compared to an outflow of ¬£ 16.9 million in 2008 - 09 . " the club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of @entity4 ' financial fair play ' initiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013 , " chief executive @entity102 told the @entity2 website . @entity4 released a statement saying that clubs " are increasingly aware of the nature of the financial fair - play rules , which aim to encourage clubs to balance their incomes and expenses over a period of time covering four to six transfer windows . " it refused to comment on individual clubs , but said the rules did not stop them from spending money on transfers as such -- the emphasis is on balancing books at the end of the season . " there is no doubt that transfers made now will impact on the break - even results of the financial years ending 2012 and 2013 -- the first financial years to be assessed under the break - even rule , " @entity4 said . " the clubs know the rules and also know that @entity4 is fully committed to implementing them with rigor . as from this summer , all payments due on transfers and to employees will be assessed by the @entity140 as part of the ' enhanced overdue payables ' rule .

@entity65 explores an @entity1 few @placeholder have visited since the 1980s	@entity6	( @entity0 ) words matter . especially in @entity1 , where what is permissible -- to say , to do , to be seen as saying or doing -- is an ever - changing thing . it took us many years of trying to finally be allowed into @entity1 , the country with whom the @entity6 has probably its most contentious relationship . at the time , we thought that perhaps our welcome was an indicator of a new attitude , an opening of a window . but as it turned out , that is probably not the case . the window appeared to slam shut in particularly ugly fashion shortly after our departure . what we saw , what we came back with , is a deeply confusing story . because the @entity1 you see from the inside , once you walk the streets of @entity28 , meet @entity1 , is a very different place than the @entity1 we know from the news . nowhere else i 've been has the disconnect been so extreme between what one sees and feels from the people and what one sees and hears from the government . @entity1 's official attitude toward @entity6 , its policies , its actions in the region , are a matter of record . how it treats its own citizens , as far as their personal behaviors , also is a matter of record . you do not want to be perceived as behaving inappropriately in @entity1 -- as we have seen with the recent video of kids dancing along to the song , " happy . " and what is inappropriate is an ever - shifting thing . what the " government " or the president says is ok one day might be deemed dangerous or unacceptable by the clergy or the " basij " , the roving , unofficial but official religious police , on another -- as we came to find out .	@entity1:Iran	@entity0:CNN	@entity65:Anthony Bourdain	@entity6:Americans	@entity28:Tehran

it allows @placeholder to protect the area 's environment	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 and @entity3 both must refrain from sending or maintaining civilians , security forces or police in a disputed border area , the @entity1 ordered tuesday , offering each side something it could claim as a victory . tensions between the two countries have flared over @entity14 , a parcel of land on the @entity18 coast , since last year . in november , @entity2 's foreign ministry said the country had filed a lawsuit in the court to end a situation that " threatens imminent and irreparable harm " to @entity2 . the suit asked the court to stop " the construction of a canal on @entity2 soil , " the ministry said then . @entity3 has claimed it has never entered @entity2 territory and has only worked on its land . the court 's order was a provisional measure while the case is before the judges . it may be several years before a final ruling is made . the barring of any persons from the disputed area was a unanimous decision . the court did not order @entity3 to refrain from dredging . by a 13 - 4 vote , the justices said that @entity2 could send personnel to the area to protect the environment , but only in a manner that wo n't escalate tensions . the judges also ordered @entity3 and @entity2 to " refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the court or make it more difficult to resolve . " finally , all the judges agreed that both countries will inform the court of their compliance with the order . the @entity1 is the @entity59 's high court , based in the @entity60 . @entity2 president @entity61 praised the court 's ruling , calling the decision " just .

" people with autism have unique talents , " explains @placeholder	@entity32	( @entity0 ) -- we hear a lot about children with autism . but adults on the spectrum face their own set of challenges . one of the big ones ? finding and getting a job that fits their unique talents and temperaments . @entity0 recently profiled @entity14 still , a woman with @entity17 's syndrome ( a high - functioning variant of autism ) who has had a tough time finding the right career environment . her story seemed to bring up as many questions as it answered , so we enlisted her , along with a couple of experts , to address them in a live @entity30 chat . joining still in the chat were @entity32 of @entity33 , who has worked with and managed employees with autism as well as having a son with @entity17 's , and @entity37 of @entity38 , which provides job training for those with disabilities and other barriers . you can read the full transcript of the chat on @entity30 , or scan through the highlights below to find out how people with autism can confront the challenges they face when finding a job . some responses have been edited for clarity . what is the no. 1 challenge you see with those on the spectrum trying to find employment ? @entity59 : the no. 1 challenge our agency faces when trying put someone with a disability to work is either lack of work experience or a gap in employment . with the job market being so competitive , it is difficult to sell people as the most qualified and capable when the work history does not reflect this . this is why our agency focuses on giving people that we serve an advantage over others by training them to be excellent employees to match local employers ' needs . still : the no. 1 challenge would be to find places that are not invading all the senses at one time : too many people , bright fluorescent lights and sudden chaotic noises , where there is no room to breathe and be yourself . those are major challenges . many ( people with autism ) are extremely sensitive and it gets to us much more than regular people . for me sudden and loud abrasive people and places really do not sit well . i have to leave really fast when it gets too overwhelming . i have to go be by myself and cover my ears often . what do you wish employers knew about those with autism and @entity17 's ? @entity32 : people with autism have unique talents and they can be some of your best employees . get to know them . they do n't need to be micro-managed or get special treatment . simply give them a challenge , the support that they need and then get out of the way . @entity59 : employers need to be flexible when working with people with all disabilities . most of the time , it is not as important how something is done as that it is done safely and correctly within the set time frame . our focus is to make sure that someone is equal and not " special " in the workplace . sometimes this takes some accommodations , but people with disabilities should be expected to be able to perform the essential functions of the job . i hired someone with @entity17 's -- now what ? are there careers that @entity17 excel in more than others ? @entity32 : one of the most important things is to pick the right career . sales and marketing may be a bigger challenge because those fields need people who are more socially adept , but mathematicians and engineers need a gift for logic and reason . just help them pick a field that is better suited for people on the spectrum . is there a list of " disability - friendly " employers ? @entity59 : usually agencies like mine develop those regionally . it 's all about relationships and supportive employers . there are some that are large national chains and some are mom and pop operations . we try to focus on finding a job for each person based on what they would like to do rather than trying to fit people into certain jobs / employers . as a person with autism , would it be safe to tell employers during the interview that you have autism ? @entity32 : i would wait to tell your employer . every employee is unique and has strengths and weaknesses . during the interview process , focus on your strengths and what it is you can offer your employer . once you land that job , build up trust with your manager , and then if you feel comfortable with sharing that you have autism , do so , but be prepared to help them understand what it means to have autism , including the opportunities . i have @entity17 's and i 'm just like you it 's hard enough to get a job , and @entity17 's does sometimes get in the way . any advice on how to get jobs ? @entity32 : there is no question that finding a job can be a challenge for any of us . for those with @entity17 's , my advice is that a little interview coaching can go a long way . one of the key things employers look for is someone that is a cultural fit to the company and team . it 's a hard process for everyone involved in the interviewing process . an interview coach can help with how to answer questions and present the best you that you can be . check with your local university or community college : schools often host interviewing workshops for the public , and you do n't need to be a student or a graduate . what can parents of those on the spectrum do to help prep their children for the workplace ? @entity59 : it is important for parents to realize that autism does not make it impossible to work , by any means . it may mean that someone will need a specific environment that fits their needs . it is also important for everyone to realize that employers ( as well as the general public ) will eventually expect someone with any disability to be able to function in the world . i think it is very natural for parents to want to protect or shield their child from anything unpleasant or uncomfortable , but it will be something that will happen eventually . having expectations of responsibility , chores , school work , etc. is important for any child to transition from school to work . @entity32 : one of the most important things is to help your child pick the right career . spend time exploring different careers . mathematics , computer science , graphic design are all great options for people on the spectrum . my brother always says i need to get my son into the best business school i can because of how he loves to organize things . growing up autistic have you found it important to speak out publicly on workplace issues ? @entity32 : yes , i feel that it has been very important to speak up . people can make harsh and often incorrect judgments about those on the autistic spectrum . if we , who understand the challenges of those living on the spectrum , do n't speak up now , then the day may come where we wish we had , but ca n't . @entity59 : i find it 's important to show success stories about people on the autism spectrum going to work and successfully keeping a job . if nothing else , it gives people hope .	@entity17:Asperger	@entity30:Facebook	@entity33:Myriad Genetics	@entity14:Sarah	@entity37:Becky Ketts	@entity38:Nobis Works	@entity0:CNN	@entity32:Dave Wellman	@entity59:Ketts

" and commandeering the mike from her director , @entity45 . she provided a classic moment of @entity3 craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes . @entity38 seemed boorish , sure . but that does n't necessarily make her wrong . the @entity54 certainly faced a dilemma this year : vote for the future , or make up for the past . years from now , it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that " @entity67 , " one of the biggest movies ever -- and , more importantly , the one that indicates where movies are going -- did n't win the top prize when @entity65 had a chance to bestow it . instead , the @entity3 gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize . what helped make it all so complicated was not that there 's been a long , long history of overlooked genius female directors that the @entity3 had to atone for . the sin at stake was -- and is -- that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct . predictably , @entity4 did n't have to be as good as the boys , she had to be better . and she was . but earning your oscars and actually getting them are two different things . fortunately for @entity4 , she had history on her side last night . @entity91 did n't . the billions being made by " avatar " will probably be some consolation , but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy , which is what the @entity54 voters like . in fact , the big - hearted , sentimental acceptance by best actor @entity99 ( " @entity103 " ) , and the rather elegant , funny remarks by best actress @entity101 ( " @entity102 " ) , are exactly what we all want @entity3 night to be . that , and a few good jokes , which is what @entity10 and @entity2 provided , arriving on stage after a musical extravaganza starring @entity112 that seemed ready to recall the bad old days of producer @entity113 and the notorious @entity116 / @entity115 musical overture of 1989 . looking back on @entity3 's ' train wreck ' nothing so ghastly reared its ugly head last night , although there were a few moments of bad choices , bad manners and a strategy that was , at best , elusive . for all the changing characters and categories on oscar - watchers ' betting pool ballots , there are certain things we bet on no matter what : one , that the show will be interminable ; two , that it will last at least until midnight ( et ) no matter how they try to contain it ; and , three , that there will be moments in the show itself that , although planned by seemingly sane individuals , will be inexplicable , if not grotesque . last night did not disappoint . while someone like poor @entity149 got drowned out by the orchestra ( after he and @entity145 won best live action short for " @entity147 " ) , the show 's producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable , unspeakable interpretive dance number , this one devoted to the evening 's musical scores . more painful , at least to this viewer 's eyes , was an overlong salute to the late director @entity162 , featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players , a few of whom -- @entity167 , for instance , and @entity169 -- looked positively shell shocked . the only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category : the @entity178 " @entity177 , " beat out the favored " @entity179 , " thus continuing the @entity3 tradition of giving the foreign - film prize to something few have even seen ( a foreign - film @entity3 does n't do much good , one should remember , for a movie that 's already opened and closed ) . the other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer @entity182 accepted her " @entity183 " @entity3 . " i 've already got two of these , " she said , before dissing her coworkers and , by extension , the @entity54 in toto . @entity191 dismissal is not a quality @entity3 tolerates very well and it 's not likely ms. @entity182 will be back , unlike @entity10 and @entity2 , who were the funniest @entity3 hosts ever , proving there 's power in numbers , the sum often can be more than the parts , and that it 's always good to have an extra pair of hands , as long as they stay off @entity4 's butt . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .	@entity23:Hurt Locker	@entity169:Judd Nelson	@entity26:I Am Woman	@entity25:Helen Reddy	@entity28:Zoe Saldana	@entity29:Carey Mulligan	@entity116:Rob Lowe	@entity115:Snow White	@entity113:Alan Carr	@entity112:Neil Patrick Harris	@entity3:Oscar	@entity2:Alec Baldwin	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:New York	@entity7:Ladies ' Night	@entity177:El Secreto de Sus Ojos	@entity4:Kathryn Bigelow	@entity179:White Ribbon	@entity178:Argentine	@entity8:Boys ' Town	@entity191:Brusque	@entity54:Academy	@entity33:Thank Heaven For Little Girls	@entity32:Best Original Song	@entity10:Steve Martin	@entity38:Burkett	@entity101:Sandra Bullock	@entity102:The Blind Side	@entity103:Crazy Heart	@entity99:Jeff Bridges	@entity91:James Cameron	@entity204:Anderson	@entity162:John Hughes	@entity145:Joachim Back	@entity147:The New Tenants	@entity167:Molly Ringwald	@entity182:Powell	@entity183:Young Victoria	@entity149:Tivi Magnusson	@entity45:Roger Ross Williams	@entity41:Music by Prudence	@entity67:Avatar	@entity65:Hollywood
@entity41 top - scores with 85 as @entity1 beat @entity7 in semifinals in @placeholder	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 reached the final of the @entity3 for the third time after beating fierce rivals and neighbors @entity7 by 29 runs in @entity9 on wednesday . @entity11 's team will play fellow co-hosts @entity13 in saturday 's final in @entity14 , with both teams seeking to win the 50 - over tournament for the second occasion in the first all - asia title match . the semifinal in @entity21 province was @entity7 's first match in @entity1 since the 2008 @entity14 terrorist attacks which further strained relations between the two sub-continent nations . cricket fans in both countries abandoned work to watch the match on television and giant screens in stadiums , while respective prime ministers @entity34 of @entity1 and @entity7 's @entity35 attended the game in a show of diplomacy . when cricket means more than just a match veteran batsman @entity41 top - scored with a fortuitous 85 as @entity1 posted a total of 260 - 9 in their allotted overs , while @entity45 claimed five wickets for @entity7 to give his team a reasonable total to chase . but @entity1 took vital wickets at regular intervals , as 1992 champions @entity7 were bowled out for 231 off the penultimate delivery with @entity53 top - scoring on 56 . the victory sparked scenes of jubilation among @entity1 fans in @entity9 , @entity0 correspondent @entity58 reported . " the main roads are blocked by cars . people are sitting on top of them , beating drums and dancing on the roads . men have taken their t - shirts off and are screaming and shouting . a really electric atmosphere ! " @entity58 said . " some people are hanging out of car windows -- some are standing on top of cars and waving the @entity73 flag . " @entity7 prime minister in @entity1 for cricket diplomacy @entity41 , who scored 98 when @entity1 beat @entity7 in the group stages of the 2003 tournament , survived a strong appeal for leg before wicket and was dropped four times before becoming the fifth man to fall with the total at 187 . the 37 - year - old , the world 's highest run - scorer in both limited - overs and test formats , hit 11 fours from 115 balls faced until he was finally caught by @entity7 captain @entity91 to be the first of two wickets for @entity94 . it put him second behind @entity13 's @entity96 as the tournament 's leading scorer , with 464 from eight innings , and earned him the man - of - the - match award . " it 's always memorable to play against @entity7 , and to be on the winning side five times against them is a memory i will always cherish , " he told @entity101 . " but it was a brilliant effort in the field and by the bowlers today . when we batted we had to make sure we got a fighting total . i thought 310 or 315 would have been a good par score . then the ball started stopping and spinning and something closer to 270 was par. " @entity45 , playing just his 18th one - day international , had taken three of those first five wickets including dangerous big - hitter @entity120 for a first - ball duck immediately after he dismissed @entity122 ( 9 ) . the 25 - year - old left - arm fast bowler was unable to get rid of @entity11 and claim a memorable hat - trick , but he later trapped the @entity1 skipper lbw for 25 and finished with career - best figures of 5 - 46 . @entity45 also helped to run out tailend batsman @entity127 as @entity1 scored only 60 runs in the final 10 overs . @entity7 made a solid start in reply with 44 on the board before @entity133 fell to @entity134 with the final ball of the ninth over , becoming the left - armer 's 18th wicket of the tournament . @entity133 made a brisk 19 off 21 balls faced , while his fellow opener @entity142 scored 43 from 59 before being second man out . at 102 - 2 the match was still in the balance , but spinner @entity120 dismissed @entity146 ( 30 ) and veteran batsman @entity147 ( 13 ) to turn the tide in @entity1 's favor . @entity150 tried to get @entity7 's run - rate back to the required level with a quickfire 29 off 24 balls , including two sixes , but when he was bowled by @entity156 it left his team needing 119 runs from 16.5 overs . @entity53 was the last man out , caught in the deep by @entity122 off @entity134 , but his runs came off a pedestrian 76 deliveries and he was not able to force the pace until @entity7 's victory bid became almost a lost cause . all the @entity73 bowlers ended with two wickets each , with @entity134 moving above @entity169 's @entity168 into second place in the overall standings behind @entity91 , who has 21 in total for the tournament .	@entity21:Punjab	@entity127:Ashish Nehra	@entity35:Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani	@entity150:Umar Akmal	@entity156:Harbhajan Singh	@entity133:Akmal	@entity3:Cricket World Cup	@entity1:India	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Pakistan	@entity177:Asia	@entity9:Mohali	@entity53:Misbah	@entity91:Afridi	@entity58:Kapur	@entity73:Indian	@entity14:Mumbai	@entity13:Sri Lanka	@entity34:Manmohan Singh	@entity11:Dhoni	@entity101:AFP	@entity96:Tillakaratne Dilshan	@entity94:Saeed Ajmal	@entity122:Kohli	@entity120:Yuvraj	@entity146:Asad Shafiq	@entity147:Younis Khan	@entity142:Mohammad Hafeez	@entity168:Tim Southee	@entity169:New Zealand	@entity134:Zaheer	@entity45:Riaz	@entity41:Sachin Tendulkar
@entity19 hopes to be a player on the @placeholder continent and blunt @entity25 's influence	@entity147	by any measure it 's historic : the vast majority of @entity4 's leaders flying to @entity5 at the invite of the president , whose father was born on the continent , to mark what the @entity10 hopes is a new era of cooperation . while plans for the first @entity16 this week in the nation 's capital are ambitious , the reality is the @entity19 still has strides to make on the kind of political and economic relationships in @entity4 that can benefit both sides . other nations , namely @entity25 , have turned their focus to the continent as a trade partner . terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries , most notably in @entity31 , where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year . and while @entity19 - backed efforts have helped slow the spread of @entity36 , countries there rate among the lowest in life expectancy and infant mortality . " the importance of this for @entity19 needs to be understood , " president @entity39 said on friday about the summit . he added later that @entity4 " happens to be one of the continents where @entity19 is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life . " here are five reasons that the @entity19 - @entity51 , which kicked off on monday , is important : 1 . health scare : the health problems in @entity4 were underscored this week when an @entity55 outbreak prompted leaders of two nations to cancel their trips to @entity5 . @entity61 president @entity60 , a @entity63 winner , and @entity64 , the leader of @entity65 , both said they would remain in their countries . @entity55 has killed more than 700 people in three nations : @entity69 , @entity61 and @entity70 . summit leaders , and even @entity39 , have stressed there is no risk to @entity74 from those arriving from @entity4 this week . @entity39 said anyone who might have been exposed to the virus would be screened both in their home countries and upon arrival in the @entity19 . but worry over the worsening outbreak only highlighted challenges @entity4 faces in combating disease and poverty , despite the billions in @entity19 aid over the years . " this is an uphill challenge for them , " said @entity85 , @entity39 's senior director for development and @entity87 , noting both @entity61 and @entity65 had recently emerged from periods of civil war . @entity39 hopes to move past the traditional elements of humanitarian aid to @entity4 , focusing instead on potential trade . but promoting commercial ties with countries engulfed in @entity55 outbreaks could prove to be difficult . the @entity98 warned against non-essential travel to @entity65 and @entity100 last week , and some schools and businesses have closed . " the timing is very unfortunate , and no one would have wished for this , " said @entity103 , an associate professor of international affairs at @entity105 . " having high - level discussions between the @entity19 and @entity4 on business and investment are infrequent . so to the extent that this distracts from that i think will be regretted all around . " 2 . security challenges : another potential barrier to @entity19 investment in @entity4 : growing extremism on the continent , which has overwhelmed certain governments . the most flagrant example came earlier this summer , when the group @entity122 kidnapped more than 200 school girls in @entity31 . the incident prompted international outrage and so far , a @entity19 - backed team has not located them . @entity31 - based @entity122 opposes western - style education , and there are fears the group 's influence could be crossing borders . last month , armed gunman suspected to be @entity122 militants abducted the wife of @entity138 's deputy prime minister . intra-country sniping has followed . @entity31 has expressed frustration with @entity138 for not doing enough to fight @entity122 on its side of the border , a charge @entity138 has denied . the unrest has inflicted damage on @entity147 economies , including @entity31 's , the largest on the continent . other @entity147 nations combating violent extremism , like @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , are also tough sells for @entity19 investment . many of those nations want more @entity19 assistance to counter militants , sentiments likely to be expressed at this week 's summit . " we are concerned about efforts by terrorist groups to gain a foothold in @entity4 , " said @entity161 , @entity39 's deputy national security adviser . he pointed to @entity19 counterterror efforts that aim to partner with nations in stemming unrest . " we 're looking at how do we get at the broader issue of countering violent extremism in @entity4 so that these groups , like @entity122 , like @entity171 , like @entity172 , are not able to prey on young people with disinformation and intimidation , " he said . 3 . countering @entity25 : the @entity19 has some catching up to do in @entity4 when it comes to trade and investment . @entity25 's imports of @entity147 oil and natural minerals have skyrocketed over the past two decades . alongside have come massive @entity25 investments in @entity147 infrastructure and construction projects , manned by waves of @entity25 workers who ended up remaining in @entity4 . more than a million @entity25 citizens now live there . " @entity4 is in a very particular moment , economically speaking , " said @entity103 during an interview with @entity190 from @entity191 . " the continent has been growing very fast . demographically , there 's a bulge in terms of it 's youth population . and @entity4 needs partnerships . " @entity39 wants to make sure the @entity19 is one of those partners , and a more attractive one than @entity25 . " my advice to @entity147 leaders is to make sure that if , in fact , @entity25 is putting in roads and bridges , number one , that they 're hiring @entity147 workers ; number two , that the roads do n't just lead from the mine to the port to @entity213 , but that there 's an ability for the @entity147 governments to shape how this infrastructure is going to benefit them in the long term , " @entity39 told @entity208 last week . 4 . cementing legacy : @entity39 's two predecessors both secured legacy achievements in @entity4 -- @entity223 through his @entity224 , and @entity225 through his program combating @entity227 . @entity39 similarly hopes for a way to leave his mark on the continent after he leaves office , though his status as the first president of @entity147 descent has already made history . that fact led some @entity147 to regard @entity39 with outsized expectations when he took office in 2009 , leading to some disappointment that he has n't focused more on shoring up @entity19 - @entity4 ties . during his time in office , @entity39 has focused on terrorism , uprisings in the @entity246 world , @entity248 provocations , and the much - awaited pivot to @entity250 . @entity39 made his first presidential trip to @entity4 in 2009 when he visited @entity252 . he did n't return again until 2013 with tour of @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 . he 's embarked upon an initiative that aims to bring electricity to more @entity147 , and a program supporting young leaders working toward @entity262 governments . both are elements to a legacy designed to shore up conditions for individuals on the continent . and the summit itself , while not expected to produce any large - scale trade agreements , is meant to signal a shift from purely humanitarian assistance to a two - way partnership . " we believe it can be a game - changer in the @entity19 - @entity4 relationship , " @entity161 said of the summit . 5 . not invited : while the bulk of @entity4 's leaders will be in @entity5 , the continent 's most reviled leaders wo n't be attending . they include @entity284 's @entity283 and @entity286 's @entity285 . they were n't invited because of their alleged human rights abuses . other controversial leaders -- like @entity152 's @entity291 , accused of crimes at the @entity293 -- will attend . like any major diplomatic gathering , the @entity294 has been an exercise in protocol and careful planning . instead of meeting with leaders separately , @entity39 has been scheduled for larger group discussions , to the disappointment of some who wanted to talk to him one - on - one . " we just would n't be able to do bilats with everybody , and so the simplest thing is for the president to devote his time to engaging broadly with all the leaders . that way we 're not singling out individuals at the expense of the other leaders , " @entity161 said . he noted @entity39 would speak with each leader individually during a dinner at the @entity10 on tuesday . that event has taken on state dinner - type proportions , with a large tent constructed on the @entity319 . organizers have the added stress of accommodating leaders of 50 nations , all with varied religious and cultural sensitivities that must be respected . for example , servers must know who drinks alcohol and who abstains for religious reasons . it 's a reflection of just how diverse @entity4 is , and how high the stakes are for @entity39 as he forges new relationships there .	@entity25:China	@entity147:African	@entity250:Asia	@entity252:Ghana	@entity254:Senegal	@entity85:Gayle Smith	@entity256:South Africa	@entity87:Democracy	@entity153:Somalia	@entity152:Kenya	@entity151:Mali	@entity171:al-Shabaab	@entity172:al-Qaeda	@entity5:Washington	@entity4:Africa	@entity319:South Lawn	@entity10:White House	@entity191:Nairobi	@entity190:CNNI	@entity51:Africa Leader 's Summit	@entity55:Ebola	@entity294:Africa Leaders Summit	@entity74:Washingtonians	@entity248:Russian	@entity70:Sierra	@entity293:International Criminal Court	@entity31:Nigeria	@entity16:African Leaders Summit	@entity36:HIV / AIDS in Africa	@entity39:Obama	@entity69:Guinea	@entity19:U.S.	@entity100:Libera	@entity246:Arab	@entity103:French	@entity105:Columbia University	@entity98:State Department	@entity122:Boko Haram	@entity262:Democratic	@entity223:Bill Clinton	@entity161:Rhodes	@entity225:George W.

@entity97 gives hosts @entity1 a record 14 golds in @placeholder	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 reserved the best to last as its ice hockey heroes beat arch - rivals the @entity4 3 - 2 with an overtime goal from @entity6 to claim the final gold of the @entity8 . @entity6 , @entity1 's star player , broke @entity4 hearts with his goal seven minutes and 40 seconds into added time to give the hosts its 14th gold of a triumphant @entity14 . @entity1 looked headed for a comfortable victory as @entity16 scored in the first period and teammate @entity18 followed up to make it 2 - 0 early in the second . but @entity20 pulled one back later in the second period to set up a frantic finale . @entity1 's much - vaunted @entity24 hero @entity6 missed a breakaway chance to seal the gold for his side but with the clock counting down it seemed not to matter . that was until the @entity4 threw caution to the wind and @entity33 forced overtime with just 25 seconds remaining , his fourth goal of the @entity36 for the previously unbeaten in five @entity4 squad . the momentum now appeared to be with the @entity4 , who had beaten @entity1 5 - 3 in a preliminary round match . but they reckoned without @entity6 , who had not been a significant factor in the final until he came good as he received a pass from @entity45 and slid his winning shot under @entity4 goaltender @entity46 . he was immediately mobbed by teammates who had finally lived up to the expectations of an ice hockey - mad nation . " i just shot it , " @entity6 told gathered reporters . " it does n't even feel real . it feels like a dream . " it 's the first victory for a host country in @entity59 ice hockey since the famous @entity4 triumph at @entity61 in 1980 . but their 2010 counterparts were unable to match their golden feat and it clearly hurt . " we only came here for one thing we wanted that gold medal , it 's really a tough feeling right now . it stings you a lot , said @entity75 . the other gold decided on the 17th and final day of action in @entity78 went to @entity80 's @entity79 who won the men 's 50km cross country title . he beat @entity85 's @entity84 in a two - up sprint with @entity87 of @entity88 taking the bronze .	@entity20:Ryan Kesler	@entity24:Stanley Cup	@entity80:Norway	@entity84:Axel Teichmann	@entity85:Germany	@entity87:Johan Olsson	@entity88:Sweden	@entity1:Canada	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Sidney Crosby	@entity4:United States	@entity8:Winter Games	@entity79:Petter Northug	@entity78:Vancouver	@entity75:Patrick Kane	@entity59:Olympic	@entity16:Jonathan Toews	@entity33:Zach Parise	@entity14:Vancouver Games	@entity36:Games	@entity18:Corey Perry	@entity97:Victory	@entity45:Jarome Iginla	@entity46:Ryan Miller	@entity61:Lake Placid
@placeholder , one of @entity13 's most violent militant groups , has pledged allegiance to @entity22	@entity15	a vehicle explodes . two trucks full of armed men race closer to the resulting crater at the @entity5 army camp in @entity6 . the black - clad militants chase the survivors , killing all the soldiers . all of it is captured on video . at least 31 @entity13 soldiers were killed in the october attack , the deadliest to date committed by the @entity6 - based militant group @entity15 ( champions of @entity17 ) . @entity15 militants released video of the ambush in mid-november -- just days after pledging allegiance to @entity22 , the @entity23 terror group that now controls large parts of @entity25 and @entity26 . the footage , which also shows a number of drive - by shootings and roadside bomb blasts , suggests that the group 's firepower and strategic planning is becoming more sophisticated . @entity15 operates primarily in @entity34 , an area where rolling sand dunes butt up against the @entity36 and stretch to rocky mountains in the center of the @entity39 . for years this corner has been dubbed " the most dangerous part of @entity13 . " since 2011 , the group has been attacking @entity44 interests in @entity6 by repeatedly blowing up a gas pipeline leading from the @entity13 @entity46 to @entity44 . the group stepped up the frequency of its raids after @entity13 's army overthrew president @entity50 -- a former @entity51 leader -- following a popular uprising in july 2013 . hundreds of @entity13 troops have since been slaughtered in this low - level insurgency . in the two months leading up to the october 24 massacre at @entity5 , the group more than doubled its attacks in @entity6 -- killing 62 police officers and soldiers , according to @entity59 , an @entity13 @entity61 affiliate . while looting weapons from @entity5 , a militant proclaimed to the camera : " tell the leader of @entity22 , [ @entity64 ] @entity65 , the leader of the faithful , that you are coming here and we are your soldiers . " the group has changed its logo and its name to @entity73 -- " the @entity74 " -- positioning itself as part of the bigger @entity22 " caliphate " that extends from northern @entity25 to central @entity26 . several other militant groups from the region have also pledged allegiance to @entity22 , including in @entity80 , which shares a long porous border with @entity13 that is known for being an arms - smuggling route . these pledges benefit @entity22 , whose territorial expansions have already peaked and are now stagnant , explains @entity86 , from the @entity87 at @entity88 . " it may well be very possible that @entity15 decided that in order for it to maintain its own type of momentum , to become part of a broader transnational group , would be in its own interest , " @entity86 told @entity90 . observers note the scarcity of verified information coming from @entity6 ; the military limits access to the wild terrain believed to be the group 's home and the surrounding towns and villages . most concerns about @entity15 's recent pledge of allegiance to @entity22 are focused on the possible increase in recruitment and expertise . " first thing it means is that any @entity13 currently fighting with @entity22 and @entity115 in @entity25 or @entity26 have a second arena to go and fight in without leaving the group , " @entity86 said . " they 'll add that expertise , they 'll add that training to the capacity of [ @entity15 ] . " unlike @entity22 , @entity15 mostly refrains from targeting civilians . the group has almost exclusively attacked the government , aside from one recent @entity15 video purporting to show the beheading of four civilian men who were accused of spying for @entity44 . in a video claiming responsibility for the attempted assassination in 2013 of @entity13 's minister of interior , @entity15 said it chose the site of the suicide bombing to minimize @entity51 civilian casualties . it pits itself as a defender of the people against what it calls the " apostate " army . its statements often cite videos of @entity13 's army attacking protesters in 2011 , the killing of more than one thousand @entity50 supporters in august 2013 and , most recently , a leaked video of @entity13 soldiers torturing two @entity148 . @entity15 also cites pictures of militants killed by security forces in @entity6 as further proof of abuses . " you all saw what [ security forces ] did to @entity157 in @entity13 and in all squares . this army has crossed all lines . this army did what the @entity164 did n't do with his people , " warns an unidentifiable militant in one @entity15 video . " we will kill you all , you apostates . " sitting in front of a cache of weapons supposedly taken from the @entity5 camp , @entity15 's presumed leader said he would free the " prisoners of war " held by authorities . " we told you before , the war has n't started yet . and what 's coming is worse and bitter . this is only the beginning . you opened a door you wo n't be able to close , " he said , clad in black clothing with his face blurred . following the october attack , the government ordered the evacuation of houses along the @entity13 - @entity187 border , creating a one - kilometer - wide buffer zone , in a bid to curtail smuggling of arms through the @entity187 tunnels . in a video showcasing its capabilities under the banner of " a fierce military operation to purge @entity39 from the grip of terrorism and criminals " , @entity13 's army also included interviews with evacuees assuring the public that they did so willingly and received proper compensations . the residents of northern @entity6 have long complained of being neglected by @entity207 . the lack of job opportunities and development -- along with a general mistrust between @entity213 peoples and the government -- has created fertile ground for the rise of @entity15 . " this is collective punishment by the army and the police , " said @entity217 , a counter-terrorism researcher at the @entity219 . " the army has been destroying houses of the people and burning their cars and motorcycles for the past two years . " terrorist attacks have only increased as the government has stepped up operations since july 2013 , observed @entity217 , who argues that the that the narrow focus on security is counterproductive and is only making the situation worse . " it 's very complicated . it has a lot of dimensions , economic and political . we are dealing with a regime that since july 2013 has been saying ' it 's me and only me , no parliament or elections , ' " said @entity217 . opening the public sphere for competing viewpoints , he argued , would help curb terrorism . but defeating @entity15 will take more than establishing security . @entity217 says the government first needs to improve the lives of the civilians in the area . in the meantime , @entity15 is no longer confined to @entity6 . it has launched attacks in the @entity253 , in @entity207 , and against @entity44 -- the group 's original enemy . in @entity207 , observers worry that the heavy hand of security services in cracking down on dissent is fueling the violence . it provides grounds for recruitment for groups like @entity15 and is reflected in the spike in number of improvised explosive devices ( @entity267 ) defused or detonated in the @entity268 . @entity15 has only claimed responsibility for a few of these attacks . but despite the rise in number and sophistication of attacks , @entity217 believes @entity13 is safe for tourists and civilians -- at least for now . " now , @entity15 is not targeting civilians , " he told @entity90 . " but if it gets worse and they do n't see hope , then maybe . " the government sees the threat within a regional context . @entity13 president @entity285 has expressed support for the global war on @entity22 . and at home , he remains resolute . " they assume that we are incapable of confronting them . they started the fire . we were very careful that no blood is shed . but unfortunately , they wanted the exact opposite , " the former defense minister , elected president last summer , said 10 days after the october attack . @entity285 said he was n't shaken by the attack -- and refused to direct his anger at military leadership , as some voices critical of security failures have called for . he ridiculed @entity15 's attempts to create an " emirate " out of @entity6 , pledging that no one would crack the enduring unity of @entity13 . it 's impossible for @entity15 to eliminate the @entity311 world 's largest military . yet until there is a victor , the death toll will continue to rise . as the group declared in one video , it seems more determined than ever to expand : " we will eliminate borders . no passports , no visas and no borders . it 's not just about @entity6 .

@placeholder : no working @entity4 government , country willing to detain , try accused pirates	@entity13	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- piracy off the coast of @entity4 ca n't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice , according to the commander of the @entity11 's @entity10 , based in @entity12 . @entity14 vice admiral @entity13 : need to hold pirates off @entity17 's east coast accountable . because there is no working government in @entity4 and no country is willing to take captured pirates , bring them to trial and detain them , there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships , vice admiral @entity13 said at a @entity29 briefing thursday . " the problem is there 's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [ to hold them ] accountable and try them for their actions , there 's no way to -- to finish the problem , " @entity13 said . the @entity14 is making a deal with a country in the eastern @entity17 region to hold and try pirates captured by the @entity14 - led @entity47 , a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month . he said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official . in the past three months , piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of @entity17 . as of mid-january , the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months , according to @entity13 . " that [ number ] should tell you that we 're not -- we 're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt . and that 's where we have to go after , " @entity13 said . the @entity14 is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force , but at the moment , the @entity14 is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of @entity4 . there are ships from some @entity70 and @entity71 countries patrolling the waters independently as well , primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries . pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of @entity4 in 2008 , according to the @entity79 . see how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 ¬ª pirating off of @entity4 has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from @entity4 realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing . additionally , pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country . @entity13 said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of @entity4 less than one percent , but it wo n't be stopped until piracy is " disincentivized .

see a 14th - century @placeholder in @entity37	@entity334	( @entity0 ) -- ever dreamed of driving through a traffic - free @entity1 ? it 's possible when you step outside the typical summer season . in fact , winter 's embrace means a slackened tourist pace in many popular warm - weather destinations , so this is an ideal time to explore @entity10 's open roads . witness @entity11 grow an icy exoskeleton as the river persists out of sight . in @entity18 's @entity17 , the low winter sun creates optimum conditions for photographing the mighty sandstone sculptures , even prettier with a dusting of snow . out east , the @entity23 and @entity24 compensate for southerly latitude with frosty altitude and leafless , ice - glistened forests . just remember , winter driving brings its own set of cautions : the more majestic the conditions , often the more dangerous the road , especially when tooling along unfamiliar routes . from @entity35 fjords to @entity37 's high desert pueblos and covered - bridge country in @entity39 , here are @entity10 's top winter drives you 'll want to experience before spring . @entity17 , @entity18 starting point : @entity44 , @entity18 the @entity45 : 36 miles on the park 's @entity46 what to expect : beautiful any time of year , @entity17 's natural sandstone sculptures assume an ethereal quality when covered in a layer of snow and bathed in soft winter light ‚Äî best for desert photography . the scenic drive is paved , and even after a storm , snow usually melts off quickly . where to stop : @entity60 daytime temperatures ( usually in the mid- 40s ; dress in layers ) invite a walk along the @entity64 , a stroll right through the @entity66 , and a pause to marvel at @entity68 . @entity69 , @entity70 starting point : @entity72 , @entity46 the route : 40 miles on @entity74 what to expect : the temperatures may hover around zero , but the striking , stratified land formations that draw summer thousands remain steadfast ‚Äî and look even more photo - worthy in a dusting of seasonally light snow . you wo n't find many other travelers poking about , so it may just be you , the park rangers , and a whole bunch of bighorn sheep . where to stop : any of the 14 scenic overlooks to watch the sun and shadows play tag on the badlands , even if it is a wee bit nippy out there . @entity96 : most romantic winter destinations @entity98 , @entity99 starting point : @entity101 , @entity99 the route : 60 miles on @entity103 what to expect : few @entity10 beaches compare to @entity106 in winter , where the snow filters through the dune grass and gathers on the beach like a monk 's mandala . @entity113 hopping out , but if you want to stick to your car , a brief one - mile stretch between @entity115 and @entity116 offers the most scenic views . where to stop : at any beach access point , massive black - and - white eiders ( sea ducks ) floating aloft the breakers and gulls battling head down into the bracing wind inspire us to dig into the sand and forge forward . @entity130 strolls through @entity131 and @entity132 offer additional protection for the birds ‚Äî and you . @entity136 , @entity39 starting point : @entity138 , in the route : 24 miles on the @entity45 ( looping through @entity140 and @entity141 via @entity142 and @entity143 ) what to expect : @entity136 's vibrantly red , covered bridges contrast sublimely with its snow - filled meadows , especially when reflected in the ice that stalls the river below . thirty - one covered bridges cross the rivers and streams here , and this being @entity154 country , seeing horse - drawn carriages trot through them only adds to the atmosphere . each of five well - known driving circuits takes in at least half a dozen of the photo ops . where to stop : the @entity164 is haunted ‚Äî a young girl and her uncle heard horse hooves approaching on the bridge , but the buggy never materialized , so it 's said ‚Äî which makes for a spooky stop on a full - moon night . @entity96 : compare cruise ships @entity174 , @entity175 starting point : @entity177 , @entity175 the route : 40 miles on @entity179 what to expect : @entity174 provides the @entity181 with its own @entity98 experience , a series of coastal towns , local shops , and individually - owned restaurants that invite winter escape . like those who dive headfirst into the @entity106 , the bravest winter adventurers make it all the way to @entity192 at the top of the peninsula . where to stop : @entity196 contains 38 miles of trails , many of which are groomed for cross-country skiing . @entity201 , @entity202 starting point : @entity204 , @entity202 the route : 27 miles on @entity206 and @entity207 - 50 what to expect : mountains reflect off one of @entity10 's deepest lakes , filling the glassy surface with otherworldly imagery during any season , but especially resplendent in winter . bring your camera and your skis , be they @entity217 or alpine . you 'll also find plenty of beaches from which to look upon some of the planet 's clearest water . where to stop : @entity226 , part of the 14,300 - acre @entity228 , is an ideal place to dip your hands in the icy lake ( it never freezes but does get as low as 37 degrees ) , before hitting the trails for a winter walk , snowshoe , or ski . @entity96 : @entity10 's most scenic roads lakes to @entity238 , @entity239 starting point : @entity241 , @entity239 the @entity45 : 190 miles on @entity242 what to expect : following the @entity245 from the confluence of the @entity247 and lesser - known @entity248 , through historic @entity249 and a score of other @entity252 villages , this @entity244 provides plenty of history and scenery before arriving at the @entity256 and @entity257 . where to stop : history buffs make a point to stop at @entity249 , among the most impressive structures that remain from the 18th century . though widely associated with the @entity263 , the fort was actually built by the @entity264 during the @entity265 in the 1750s . @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 starting point : @entity271 , @entity268 the @entity45 : 81 miles on @entity207 and @entity272 what to expect : as you drive toward @entity276 , @entity252 , @entity274 provides a wintry window into the southern alpine wilderness , with ( often snowy ) trails leading through stands of leafless frost - glistened forests . best to keep two hands on the wheel and pull over to admire the subtle 4,928 feet of @entity284 . where to stop : few people from outside the @entity70 will believe you went skiing in @entity268 , so seize the opportunity at @entity271 resort . short on time ? the 2.1 - mile - long @entity289 up there is a scenic treat in itself . @entity292 , @entity293 starting point : @entity295 , @entity293 the @entity45 : 52 miles on the @entity296 what to expect : @entity292 's summer traffic jams thin out to lightly populated wolf - spotting groups and the occasional bachelor bison ( older males that have left the herd ) that may have you applying the brakes . you can drive into the @entity305 to look for wolves , but bisecting the park to @entity308 requires booking space on a snowcoach ( reserve early ) . where to stop : the geysers look more impressive during winter than any other season so prioritize a stay in @entity316 . ski , snowshoe , or walk upon miles of trails through the @entity320 . the @entity321 to @entity322 , @entity37 starting point : @entity324 , @entity37 the @entity45 : 52 miles on six state highways ( 503 to 520 , 76 , 75 , 518 , and finally 68 ) what to expect : a two - hour journey into high desert beauty begins when you turn off @entity207 - 285/84 about 17 miles north of @entity330 : dry snowflakes hang on junipers and pi√±on pines as you travel past the 14th - century @entity334 and wood - carving village of @entity336 . later , the snowcapped @entity337 rise in the eastern distance , more than 13,000 feet in height , as the valley spreads below . where to stop : @entity342 , located in @entity343 , offers a prime example of a mid- 18th - century adobe church , one of several along @entity347 . see all of @entity10 's best winter drives at @entity349 . planning a getaway ? do n't miss @entity96 's guide to the @entity353 's @entity352 copyright 2012 @entity354 . all rights reserved .	@entity99:MA	@entity349:travelandleisure.com	@entity96:Travel + Leisure	@entity276:Asheville	@entity274:Great Smoky Mountains National Park	@entity272:I-40E	@entity271:Ober Gatlinburg	@entity175:WI	@entity174:Northern Door County	@entity177:Sturgeon Bay	@entity179:Wisconsin Highway 57	@entity74:South Dakota Highway 240	@entity70:South	@entity72:Wall	@entity269:North Carolina	@entity268:Tennessee	@entity265:French and Indian War	@entity264:French	@entity267:Great Smoky National Park	@entity263:American Revolution	@entity140:Montezuma	@entity141:Mecca	@entity142:Howard Avenue	@entity305:Lamar Valley	@entity308:Old Faithful	@entity143:Strawberry Road	@entity68:Balanced Rock	@entity181:Upper Midwest	@entity66:Windows	@entity64:Park Avenue Trail	@entity60:Moderate	@entity252:NC	@entity256:St. Lawrence River	@entity257:Quebec	@entity154:Amish	@entity136:Parke County	@entity316:Old Faithful Snow Lodge	@entity337:Truchas Peaks	@entity130:Boardwalk	@entity132:Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary	@entity35:Alaskan	@entity37:New Mexico	@entity39:Indiana	@entity69:Badlands Loop Road	@entity247:Erie	@entity245:Champlain Trail	@entity244:National Scenic Byway	@entity242:I-87	@entity241:Waterford	@entity249:Fort Ticonderoga	@entity248:Champlain Canals	@entity324:Pojoaque	@entity320:Upper Geyser Basin	@entity321:High Road	@entity322:Taos	@entity44:Moab	@entity45:Route	@entity46:SD	@entity23:Great Smoky	@entity24:Shenandoah National Parks	@entity138:Rockville	@entity330:Santa Fe	@entity131:Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve	@entity336:Cordova	@entity334:Namb√© Pueblo	@entity238:Locks Passage	@entity239:NY	@entity17:Arches National Park	@entity11:Yellowstone Falls	@entity10:America	@entity18:UT	@entity101:Hyannis	@entity103:Massachusetts Highway 6A	@entity106:National Seashore	@entity98:Cape Cod	@entity347:The High Road	@entity342:San Jos√© de Gracia	@entity343:Las Trampas	@entity226:Sand Harbor	@entity228:Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park	@entity116:Provincetown	@entity115:Truro	@entity113:Worth	@entity354:American Express Publishing Corporation	@entity353:World	@entity352:Best Hotels	@entity1:Yosemite National Park	@entity0:CNN	@entity196:Newport State Beach	@entity192:Gills Rock	@entity295:Mammoth Hot Springs	@entity296:Grand Loop Road	@entity292:Yellowstone	@entity293:WY	@entity362:Snow	@entity217:Nordic	@entity202:NV	@entity201:Lake Tahoe	@entity207:US	@entity206:Nevada Highway 28-E	@entity204:Incline Village	@entity164:Sim Smith Bridge	@entity284:Mount Cammerer	@entity289:Aerial Tramway
perhaps the greatest challenge facing a @placeholder administration would be the nation 's debt	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- during the course of his long run for the presidency , @entity3 has consistently presented himself to voters as a " turnaround " artist , or as his supporters have taken to calling him recently , a " mr. fix - it . " in making his closing argument to voters that he should have that chance to take his government tool belt to @entity16 , @entity3 has vowed to " bring people together , " to govern as president . " i 've got be able to reach across the aisle and get good @entity25 and good @entity26 to work together , " the former @entity20 governor told a crowd in @entity22 , @entity23 , on wednesday . if @entity27 wins a second term ... " my legislature was about 85 % @entity30 and it was not lost on me that to get anything done at all , and even to have my veto upheld , i had to have people across the aisle i could work with , " he continued . @entity3 's critics insist the @entity26 candidate 's bipartisan overtures are in need of a serious reality check . they look no farther than his statement to last february 's gathering of the @entity42 in @entity16 . " i fought long odds in a deep blue state . but i was a severely conservative @entity26 governor , " @entity3 told the conference . @entity3 defends his ' severely conservative ' record the words " severely " and " conservative " are no longer part of @entity3 pitch with the campaign in the home stretch . asked how @entity3 's promises of bipartisanship align with what quickly became a @entity57 moment at @entity42 last winter , a senior campaign adviser argued the two claims are not mutually exclusive . " as governor , he brought people together to deal with health care . he 's brought people together to deal with a very big deficit that he had when he came into office , " said @entity62 , one of @entity3 's top strategists . @entity3 : my vision for @entity71 trying to bring together competing ideas , philosophies " the governor has made a point that he is going to try to bring together all of the competing ideas and philosophies in @entity16 in order to tackle some of the big challenges . does he recognize there is going to be opposition ? sure , " @entity62 added . in fact , @entity3 's aides have quietly begun laying the groundwork for a presidential transition , should he win the @entity87 . dubbed the " @entity92 " and led by former @entity91 gov. @entity90 , the transition team has already had at least one meeting with senior @entity26 lawmakers , a top congressional source told @entity2 . what would a @entity95 @entity87 look like ? " they 're interested in recommendations for @entity101 posts , " the congressional source , who was not authorized to speak about the subject publicly , said . the advance legwork could enable @entity3 to sidestep some of the problems he encountered nearly a decade ago when he entered the governor 's office in @entity106 . @entity107 , a government watchdog with the non-partisan @entity109 , said @entity3 's experience in the business world left him ill - prepared for the unwieldy mix of liberal lawmakers , advocacy groups and news media that confronted him . who might serve on @entity3 's national security team " it was a rude awakening for the @entity3 administration , " @entity119 said . " early on , the legislature and the @entity3 administration were at loggerheads . " but his passage of health care reform in the state demonstrated the self - styled " chief executive " governor was able to find his way and work across party lines . " there was a spirit of bipartisanship around health reform , " @entity119 said . the spirit was hard to miss. at the signing ceremony for his signature legislative achievement , @entity3 had none other than an old political nemesis and liberal icon , the late sen. @entity142 , at his side . after overcoming a @entity26 primary season in which @entity3 's health care reform plan was mocked as " @entity148 , " aides to the former governor now dub the initiative " successful . " where candidates stand on key issues different environment than governor 's office if elected president , however , @entity3 would inherit a dramatically different political environment . sandwiched between tea party @entity26 who have little patience for compromise and a potentially vengeful contingent of defeated @entity25 , a president @entity3 would have no shortage of challenges . @entity27 : my vision for @entity71 adding to the potential for gridlock , a longtime aide to senate majority leader @entity167 said the @entity25 leader from @entity171 hardly knows @entity3 . earlier this year , @entity167 outraged conservatives when he falsely accused @entity3 of failing to pay income taxes for a decade . @entity167 hits @entity3 over taxes , ' 47 % ' comments " when he looks at @entity3 , he sees a weak candidate , a poll - driven politician , someone who lacks any core conviction , " @entity167 's former spokesman @entity176 said . one potential flashpoint could be any attempt by @entity3 to make good on a campaign promise to partially privatize the nation 's @entity183 system for future seniors . " if he tries to go at core @entity25 priorities , like @entity187 tried to do with his proposal to privatize @entity191 , @entity167 will go at him hammer and tong , just like he and ( @entity194 ) @entity193 did with @entity187 , " @entity176 said of former president @entity187 's second term initiative to transform the federal retirement program . perhaps the greatest challenge facing a potential @entity3 administration would be the nation 's mounting debt . it remains unclear whether the upcoming lame - duck @entity200 will have the political will necessary to avert what is a largely unspoken campaign issue , the looming fiscal cliff in @entity16 . republicans and @entity25 in @entity200 , along with the president , set the nation on the perilous legislative course when they passed the @entity209 , which mandates both tax increases and massive spending cuts that take effect at the end of the year , unless a compromise is reached . candidates mum on fiscal cliff if a solution is not found , @entity3 could enter the @entity87 with a country that is reeling from what many economists agree would be a massive jolt to the economy . facing resistance from tea party on more revenue back in @entity20 , the then - governor solved his own fiscal crisis with a mixture of spending cuts and fee increases . but to conservative @entity26 in @entity16 , revenue enhancers are viewed as deal - breakers . " the tea party is not going to let him do that . the tea party is going to resist that mightily , " @entity119 said . but @entity3 made clear in the presidential debates he is comfortable shifting back to the center when it is politically advantageous . what @entity25 label " etch - a - sketching " and " @entity242 , " one @entity3 aide said the candidate is simply articulating his positions in a way that would make them more palatable to " swing voters . " @entity3 's @entity249 makeover after a sometimes painful , yet eventually successful wooing of tea party conservatives , @entity3 now openly embraces more centrist views on regulation .

the theme park has faced criticism in the wake of the @entity0 doc , " @placeholder "	@entity37	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 said friday that he felt he had no choice but cancel a gig at @entity4 , given public pressure and his own conviction that the way the aquatic entertainment giant operates is not acceptable . " i do n't agree with the way they treat their animals , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity9 . " it was n't that hard a deal for me . " the country music legend 's comments come one day after @entity18 spokesman @entity17 said @entity1 would not be part of next year bands , @entity21 & bbq events " due to scheduling conflicts . " but the 80 - year - old crooner did n't mention scheduling having played any part in his rationale . rather he nixed the show because he does not agree with @entity4 's treatment of its orca , or killer , whales and other sea creatures -- a sentiment that has spread among those who have seen " @entity37 " documentary that aired on @entity0 on the topic . he is n't alone . the @entity40 rock band @entity39 also pulled the plug on their show at the @entity44 theme park for similar reasons , a decision made two days after drummer @entity46 tweeted the group was " looking at options " after seeing " @entity37 " and after an online petition urged them to do so . @entity4 responds to questions about captive orcas , ' @entity37 ' film @entity1 pointed to similar efforts asking him to follow suit . the most meaningful , even if it had just a few hundred signatures , may have come from one of @entity1 's grandchildren , with " people she knew asking me not to play this venue . " another petition had 9,000 names attached to it on @entity66 , with author @entity67 writing that @entity1 's " activism for animals , the environment and other good causes " made it imperative that he cancel his show , in light of the documentary . when his decision became public , @entity67 declared " victory " and said she hoped his and the @entity39 ' decisions " will inspire other artists to stay away from performing at @entity4 because at least they 've got the choice -- unlike the animals trapped there . " such public pressure was n't insignificant , but @entity1 said he acted because he felt it was the right thing to do . many zoos can be considered " cruel " for how they hold animals , the singer said , adding that he would n't blame a captive monkey " for wanting to throw stuff at you .

police : @placeholder pleaded guilty in plot to kill an @entity35 - @entity14 dissident	@entity34	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- it 's the kind of @entity1 town made for daydreaming : quiet streets and sunny skies , a place where tranquility seems rarely to be disturbed . but according to police , as well as classified @entity14 diplomatic cables published by @entity15 , the @entity11 suburb of @entity0 was the scene of an international assassination plot . the scheme involved would - be killers hiding out in a low - budget motel and an elaborate plan that , at first , involved shooting the victim , but later centered on running him over with a van , police documents disclose . " i 've been a police officer here for more than 20 years , and i 've never investigated anything like this , " said @entity0 police lt. @entity26 . it all unraveled on a late summer day in 2009 , when a would - be hit man hired by an @entity35 national named @entity34 got cold feet and called police from a local gas station . " this person went on to tell us that for the past four days , they together had been scheming how to assassinate , how to kill another @entity0 resident , " @entity26 said . police said the target in @entity0 was @entity45 , an @entity35 - @entity14 dissident who is the radio voice of a small group called @entity48 , devoted to the overthrow of the @entity35 government . the @entity35 government calls tondar a terrorist group , but the @entity52 says it is only a propaganda outlet . according to police reports , the informant offered proof : the purchase of a cheap van from a used - car dealer that would be used to run down and kill the target . he told detectives he had been paid $ 5,000 to kill @entity45 , with another $ 27,000 delivered to his mother back in @entity35 . the plotters decided to use a van after deciding that buying a gun would be too risky , the reports state . the informant told police that @entity34 , the mastermind , had fled @entity0 and was about to leave @entity11 on a plane . @entity26 said @entity0 detectives found him in an airport hotel under his own name and arrested him in his room . along with his laptop computer , police seized $ 2,100 in cash . " they were crisp $ 100 bills . there was a stack of them . and around it was a bank wrapping , and they were all written in @entity84 , " he said . according to those leaked @entity14 diplomatic cables , this was n't the first time @entity34 had been implicated in an assassination attempt . a prominent @entity35 dissident in @entity91 , @entity92 , " had been targeted by @entity35 intelligence , " according to one cable . @entity92 is a prominent @entity94 commentator based in @entity91 , and @entity34 had contacted him several months before his @entity1 arrest , claiming to be a " big fan , " the january 2010 account states . but @entity92 became suspicious of @entity34 after he took large numbers of pictures -- photos that later turned up in the office of a deputy intelligence minister in @entity103 , the cable states . he stopped taking @entity34 's calls " and heard nothing more about the matter until he was visited by @entity112 anti-terror police january 14 , " according to the cable . according to the cable , @entity34 had tracked the @entity91 dissident at the same time he was making plans to assassinate the @entity1 dissident . the arrest by @entity0 police brought a halt to both plans . " @entity92 is a well - known figure both inside and outside @entity35 , and is an outspoken critic of the @entity35 regime , so it is unsurprising that the regime would want to keep a close eye on him , " the document states . " if , however , the regime has targeted @entity92 for assassination , as it appears to have done with @entity45 , it marks a clear escalation in the regime 's attempts to intimidate critics outside its borders , and could have a chilling effect on journalists , academics and others in the @entity138 who until recently felt little physical threat from the regime . " @entity45 said there was " no doubt " that the plot against him involved the @entity35 government . he said the motive was not only to kill him , but also to replace both @entity48 's website and its radio broadcasts with fakes in an attempt to hijack the movement . @entity34 ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of solicitation of murder and was jailed for eight months . but the story does n't end there . after he was released from prison in 2010 , @entity34 applied for permission to leave the @entity14 while he was on five years ' probation and visit @entity35 for one month " to visit his dying father , " according to probation reports . his first application was denied , but a second request was granted a few weeks later on the condition that he return no later than october 27 . he has not been seen in the @entity14 since . probation officials would not comment on the decision . meanwhile , another @entity166 -- a 71 - year - old @entity1 businessman named @entity168 -- was being held in an @entity35 prison . he had been jailed for more than two years after @entity35 authorities said he had given $ 200 to an @entity35 dissident group : @entity48 , the same group based in @entity0 . @entity168 denied any association with @entity48 . the money , he said , was to be given to a friend of a friend . within weeks of @entity34 's arrival in @entity35 , @entity168 walked out of @entity179 . @entity168 said he believes there was " no connection " between his release and @entity34 's arrival . his attorney , a former @entity185 administration ambassador , @entity184 , said he does n't think there 's a link , either . " but it 's an interesting coincidence , is n't it ? " @entity184 said in a telephone interview . the @entity52 told @entity2 that there was no link between @entity34 's return to @entity35 and @entity168 's release . but back in @entity0 , @entity45 said there 's no doubt in his mind that there was a swap in which the @entity14 traded the man who orchestrated his attempted murder to @entity35 in exchange for the jailed businessman . " you give my man back . i give you your man back , " he said . watch @entity207 weeknights 8pm et. for the latest from @entity207 click here .	@entity26:Staab	@entity84:Farsi	@entity112:UK	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:California	@entity0:Glendora	@entity179:Evin Prison	@entity52:State Department	@entity15:WikiLeaks	@entity14:U.S.	@entity35:Iran	@entity34:Sadeghnia	@entity11:Los Angeles	@entity103:Tehran	@entity94:Voice of America	@entity207:Parker Spitzer	@entity92:Nourizadeh	@entity91:London	@entity166:Iranian-American	@entity168:Taghavi	@entity184:Prosper	@entity185:Bush	@entity45:Sharmahd	@entity48:Tondar	@entity138:West
" the actors work well together , as did @entity12 and @placeholder , " one @entity12 says	@entity23	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- certain groups of die - hard fans are protective of the characters they hold on a pedestal . " @entity11 " has its trekkies and " @entity10 " has the @entity9 religion . @entity12 has the @entity13 , scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author sir @entity18 . many @entity13 are members of the invitation - only literary society , the @entity19 . group members have historically been critical of on - screen adaptations of their beloved consulting detective and his faithful sidekick , dr. @entity23 . while they , by nature of their adoration , saw flaws in the @entity30 " @entity12 , " which opened in theaters friday , the consensus among these experts was that the film is a fun -- and even occasionally faithful -- romp through sherlock lore that the author himself would have enjoyed . " i liked it a lot more than i thought i would , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 magistrate judge . " what i particularly liked was the @entity45 relationship . the movie really showed @entity23 as a trusted companion to @entity12 , coming to @entity12 ' aid in times of need . the @entity23 of the books is a military man who played rugby and sports in college . he is tough . he is observant on his own and @entity12 wants him around , not as a bumbling fool but as a trusted aide . " @entity23 has historically been portrayed in films as a bumbling sidekick , most famously by @entity60 actor @entity59 in a series of films from the 1940s . but director @entity30 's imagining of @entity23 is as the quick - footed , sharpshooting contemporary of @entity12 , with a rapier - sharp wit that can match the detective in the tongue - lashing department . " the movie did an excellent job in portraying the relationship between the two . the actors work well together , as did @entity12 and @entity23 . the movie shows @entity23 as intelligent , able to be a good assistant ; @entity23 , the doctor , concerned about his friend 's well - being ; and it shows his reasonable frustration with his friend 's often thoughtless ways , " said @entity75 , a @entity19 since 1981 and co-author of " dining with @entity12 . " @entity85 editor @entity84 founded the @entity19 in 1934 . the group has included mystery writers @entity87 and @entity89 and science fiction writer @entity90 . honorary members have included presidents @entity92 and @entity94 . the plot of the new @entity12 movie , starring @entity97 , as @entity12 and @entity98 as @entity23 , is n't based on an actual @entity18 story . the action centers on ritualistic murders and black magic , all leading to a case that has all of @entity104 in danger . @entity39 saw " @entity12 " at an early screening of the film on tuesday in @entity0 with a dozen other @entity13 . @entity39 has been a member of the @entity19 for 37 years , but has been a lover of the @entity12 detective stories since he was in junior high . " certain lines of dialogue were lifted the from the books , which we as @entity13 enjoyed . they got laughs from the 13 folks in the theater who were familiar with the stories , while everyone else was quiet . other than that , it was all made up except for bringing in certain character names and the supporting characters , " @entity39 noted . because they are so familiar with the entire canon of four novels and 56 short stories written by @entity18 , @entity13 naturally nitpicked some minor details . for instance , in this film , @entity23 introduces his fiancee , @entity133 , to @entity12 for the first time . " but we know @entity23 met @entity133 because she came to @entity12 for help in ' @entity137 . ' @entity12 already knew her , " @entity39 explained . and @entity12 ' love interest in the film , @entity138 , the con woman played by @entity139 , was in only one of @entity18 's stories , " a scandal in @entity145 . " " while she was called an adventuress in the story , she was not a criminal by any means , as she is portrayed in this movie , " @entity39 said . @entity18 himself would have appreciated the newest on - screen display of his hero , says @entity154 , a @entity19 and retired appeals court judge . " @entity18 was not without a sense of humor and might have been amused by this film . he did n't care enough about @entity12 to insist on canonical accuracy , " @entity75 said . " when @entity162 , working on a @entity12 play , asked @entity18 if it was ok for @entity12 to marry , @entity18 is said to have replied , ' you may marry him , or murder him , or do anything you like to him . ' " so if this portrayal is a combination of @entity12 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , " he added , " it just rolls along with the times and with the current film genre dominated by brilliant , spectacular special effects , explosions , violence , and more explosions .

@entity263 : it 's good for @placeholder to discuss balance between liberty and security	@entity28	( @entity0 ) -- as @entity2 prepares to return from its august recess , @entity1 is gearing up for a national conversation on the balance between security and liberty , between necessary surveillance and necessary privacy . that 's a good thing . it would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing . a quick review of recent commentary suggests that may not be likely . for example , @entity20 seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header " @entity26 , " a lead that brings with it its own conclusion . a prominent @entity28 senator recently opined that , " they ( the @entity30 ) basically i believe probably are looking at all the cell phone calls in @entity28 every day . " another lawmaker has already concluded that the @entity30 is " an agency out of control . " and a former congressman on a sunday talk show added to the sum total of human knowledge with this : " @entity39 ! hello ! i mean we have a @entity39 . what 's the @entity30 really about ? " i fear that the coming debate will have all the characteristics of a mob -- thoughtless action driven by artificial urgency , unreasoning fear , emotion and misinformation . and that 's a pity since the heart of this issue has been around for years and deserves serious discussion . as far back as at least 2000 , the @entity30 tried to hit the real question head - on . the agency knew that past targets of its surveillance largely communicated on their own dedicated networks . there was hardly a civil libertarian alive who would be concerned about trying to intercept communications between the @entity64 high command in @entity65 and intercontinental ballistic missile silos beyond the @entity67 . but the threats of the 21st century do not communicate on their own networks . terrorists , drug traffickers , arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the @entity30 is committed to protecting . it was clear even pre- 9/11 that the @entity30 could not do its mission without working aggressively on this common grid . it was also clear that the agency would not have the power to do so -- legally , financially or technologically -- unless the @entity28 people were convinced that this power would be limited to its intended purpose , that even as constitutionally protected communications mingled with and were sorted from targeted communications , they would still be protected . and that basically is the issue of the moment , whether the headline is @entity93 , @entity94 , metadata , " upstream " communications , @entity97 or an alleged @entity30 secret room at an @entity100 facility in @entity101 -- all of which have been featured in recent coverage . @entity28 will have to decide what constitutes a " reasonable " expectation of privacy and what running room they will give their government to search for the signals almost everyone agrees should be captured even as those signals co-exist with their own . although @entity2 , the courts and two administrations have authorized what the @entity30 is doing today , these are not easy issues . resolution will hinge on how much trust people have in their government , or at least this part of it . it will also hinge on how much danger with which people are willing to live . and if this is to be a fact - based discussion , resolution will also hinge on how well citizens understand a few basics of what exactly is being done . unfortunately , much of the public discourse is confused to the point of incoherence . take the question of authorities . how does the @entity30 get the power to do any of this ? in most instances , since this is about foreign intelligence , authority comes from the president and is codified in @entity140 . only when a @entity28 person is involved or for certain kinds of collection in the @entity28 does the agency have to rely on the @entity145 and the court it established . this is important . most intelligence collection -- by the @entity30 , @entity39 or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court . oversight comes from the president and the @entity2 . but it is still oversight . breathless claims that some things are done without court review could well be true -- and not very relevant . then there is collection involving @entity28 . most casual commentators simply assert that anytime the @entity30 is listening to an @entity28 , the agency must have a warrant . indeed , trying to calm current concerns , president @entity163 told @entity165 that , absent a warrant , " what i can say unequivocally is that if you are a @entity28 person , the @entity30 can not listen to your telephone calls . ... " actually , that 's not quite correct -- and never has been . as the president suggested later in the interview , the @entity30 can not target the communications of a @entity28 person . if it is tracking the communications of a legitimate foreign intelligence target and that target talks to an @entity28 , the @entity30 indeed covers it -- and always has . this simply makes sense . picture a known terrorist who makes a series of operational calls to confederates in say @entity185 , @entity186 and the @entity187 . to suggest that the @entity30 has to stop coverage of the last call is ludicrous . this is what the @entity30 calls incidental collection of information to , from or about a @entity28 person . when this occurs -- and it is not rare -- the agency is required to keep its focus on the foreign intelligence in the communication and minimize or mask the @entity28 identity unless the identity is essential to the intelligence ( as it would be in the example above ) . keep this in mind when commentators claim that the @entity30 has collected the content of @entity28 e-mails or phone calls . that may be , but the @entity30 is not targeting them without a warrant . and then there are the numbers . like the @entity218 's august 15 headline screaming , " @entity30 broke privacy rules thousands of times per year , audit finds . " you have to dig deeper to learn ( as i pointed out in another piece ) that all of the incidents were inadvertent ; no one is claiming that any rules were intentionally violated ; and all of the incidents were discovered , reported and corrected by the @entity30 itself . in one example , the @entity218 referred to " large numbers of data base query incidents . " the @entity30 later confirmed that in one quarter there indeed were 115 incidents of @entity30 queries being incorrectly entered , mistakes such as mistyping or using overly broad search criteria . that 's 115 out of more than 61 million inquiries made in that quarter , a compliance rate of .999998 . in this , as in most issues , facts ( and context ) matter . understanding beyond the accusatory headline or the facile quip is needed , or we will be just tossing slogans at one another , slinging volleys of hyperbole , stoking fears and anger and distrust , all of which will make it even more difficult to resolve an already very difficult question . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .	@entity20:Fox News	@entity26:NSA Scandal	@entity28:Americans	@entity2:Congress	@entity1:Washington	@entity0:CNN	@entity218:Post	@entity30:NSA	@entity145:Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act	@entity39:CIA	@entity100:AT&T	@entity101:San Francisco	@entity97:Blarney	@entity94:XKeyscore	@entity93:PRISM	@entity263:Hayden	@entity163:Barack Obama	@entity140:Executive Order 12333	@entity165:Charlie Rose	@entity185:Paris	@entity186:London	@entity187:Bronx	@entity67:Urals	@entity64:Soviet	@entity65:Moscow
the shooting of @entity12 was " lawful self - defense , " district attorney @placeholder says	@entity16	( @entity0 ) -- a sheriff 's deputy who shot and killed a 13 - year - old @entity4 boy last year when he mistook a toy gun for a real rifle did not break the law , a prosecutor said monday . the investigation concluded that since deputy @entity14 " honestly and reasonably believed " his life was in danger , the shooting of @entity12 was " lawful self - defense , " said @entity15 , @entity4 , district attorney @entity16 . the @entity15 deputy said he thought @entity12 was armed with an @entity18 , but it was actually a replica . @entity14 said that when he yelled at the boy , whose back was turned to him , to put the weapon down , the boy turned toward him , according to a sheriff 's statement issued after the october 22 , 2013 , shooting in @entity26 , @entity4 . as @entity12 turned " toward him , the barrel of the assault rifle was rising up and turning in his direction , " the statement said .

" it 's ridiculous that these cops can be on our streets and think it 's ok to use the excuse that they feared for their life when they kill our children , when they kill our youth , when they kill anybody , " @entity12 supporter @entity50 said after the announcement .

@placeholder : @entity6 and @entity13 audiences " not that different "	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- from " @entity4 " to " @entity3 , " @entity2 's movies have entranced audiences in @entity6 and the @entity7 . @entity0 spoke to the director of " @entity9 " and " @entity10 ! " at the @entity11 in @entity12 about filmmaking in @entity6 and @entity13 and her adaptation of @entity17 's novel about loss and family , " @entity16 . " ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . film director @entity2 @entity0 : what inspired you to make " @entity16 " ? @entity2 : i happened to read " @entity16 " on a plane in early 2004 , when i traveled from @entity25 to @entity26 to finish the filming of " @entity3 . " i read " @entity16 " while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [ @entity2 's mother in law ] . it was at that state of mourning that i picked up this novel , and in it @entity17 writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country , and i thought i had been understood by someone . it was also a story that linked the two cities in which i had grown up -- @entity44 and @entity25 -- and it was almost certainly the road that i had traveled . it just spoke to me and i felt compelled to do this film . a few months later we were shooting it . @entity0 : it 's filmed in both @entity6 and @entity25 , such different cultures . tell us about the universal themes involved during the film . @entity2 : well , the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills . it 's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another , and tried to find out who we are through these places . then when we have children , life gets more interesting . it is about growing up through our adult lives and our children 's lives . it is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who do n't send roses and diamonds for love ; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other . it 's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another , versus the clang and hustle of young @entity89 who is 15 and grows up in an @entity13 world because he wishes to be @entity13 . that flow -- that see - saw between parents and children , that 's what " @entity16 " is about . @entity0 : tell us about casting the role of @entity89 . @entity2 : well , @entity98 plays @entity89 and he 's known as a comic star , but i had no idea that he existed until my 15 - year - old son said , " this has to be your @entity89 . " i did n't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home : " tell me in the morning it 's @entity98 ! " he would say . and then @entity98 wrote to me and told me he became an actor because he had seen " @entity4 " when he was eight years old and realized people on the screen could look like him , and other such seductive things . he came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing , and so much the real thing , that i cast him as @entity89 . @entity0 : how have @entity6 audiences reacted to your heavily western - influenced films ? @entity2 : it 's not that different a kind of audience , that 's what pleases me . " @entity10 ! " we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that @entity127 stuff , and also with " @entity128 , " which ran for 27 weeks . " @entity9 " was also a big hit in @entity6 . but no , they do n't come to my films for @entity127 fare ; it 's a completely alternative thing . in terms of audiences on both sides , i 've been blessed : the films have been really well received and highly anticipated . @entity0 : " @entity16 " was filmed in @entity13 and @entity6 . what differences were there in the two locations ? @entity2 : in @entity6 it is more about orchestrating chaos , and it 's about sifting the chaos , but i get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on , and in @entity13 it 's about paying for the chaos , you know every head has to be placed there and paid for . @entity0 : " @entity16 " is about not losing the identity of @entity6 culture . was that a challenge ? @entity2 : i am at home in many cultures . i live actively in three continents and i 've done that for most of my life , so i just make films as i see the world , and that happens to speak to people . i do things that i want to do . it so happens because i am fluent in both worlds that my films enter both worlds , perhaps . @entity0 : do @entity6 and @entity13 audiences behave differently ? @entity2 : no , not really . i think films have to reach people and really grab them . that 's what i hope to do when i make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something , and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere . e-mail to a friend	@entity3:Vanity Fair	@entity2:Nair	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:West	@entity6:Indian	@entity11:Bollywood Movie Awards	@entity4:Mississippi Masala	@entity16:The Namesake	@entity9:Monsoon Wedding	@entity17:Jhumpa Lahiri	@entity44:Calcutta	@entity10:Salaam Bombay	@entity128:Deeply Alternative	@entity98:Kal	@entity13:American	@entity26:Jo'berg	@entity89:Gogol	@entity25:New York	@entity127:Bollywood	@entity12:Long Island
deeper frost line means they 're common in the @placeholder	@entity179	( @entity0 ) -- it 's one of the most familiar pieces of advice from authorities to people in the path of a tornado : get into your basement . yet few homes in the @entity12 area have them -- even though that state is hit by far more powerful tornadoes than most others . " probably less than one tenth of one percent " of the houses in @entity20 are built with basements , said @entity21 , president of @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity12 . " there 's just such a misconception that you can not do it . " why ? @entity21 cited the area 's high groundwater levels and heavy clay as among the reasons some people believe -- wrongly , he said -- that basements are tough to construct . but improved waterproofing methods can obviate the first ; and the second , too , is surmountable , according to @entity21 , who said he has built more than 600 basements in the @entity12 area over the past 15 years . " we do ' em all day long , " he said . " i 've got 32 basements to put in the ground right now . " the city of @entity20 was the epicenter of an @entity44 tornado monday that decimated neighborhoods in the @entity12 area , leaving at least 24 dead . inside a tornado - ravaged school in @entity20 , other issues can dissuade new home buyers from investing in basements , @entity21 said . one is that there are so few other such houses that comparable values are tough to estimate , " so appraisers do n't give you any credit . " in fact , basements are so rare in the area that real estate listings do not include " basement " as an option under foundation types , he said . " you can list it in the comments section , but that 's not a foundation type . " that means it 's hard for house hunters to narrow their searches to houses with basements , which makes it harder still for sellers who have built houses with basements to recoup their investments , he said . @entity20 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why @entity82 , a custom homebuilder in the area for 37 years , estimated that some 2 % of residents have basements , and 10 % to 15 % " have some kind of cellar . " none of the homes in his partially completed , 51 - house development , called @entity93 , has a basement , he said . though it was spared monday 's storms , " a block north of us it looks like @entity100 , " he said . he plans to build a community shelter that would accommodate all of its residents . alternatives exist : an above - ground shelter runs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 ; a small basement would cost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 ; and a concrete cellar built during new - house construction would cost as little as $ 2,200 , said @entity82 . tornado prediction is improving , scientists say accessibility an important element basements provide good protection if equipped with a suitable door and a concrete roof , but basements of pier - beam houses would leave their occupants exposed and vulnerable if the structure above them were blown away , said @entity121 , a former professor of civil engineering at @entity123 @entity121 created the concept of the above - ground storm shelter after a tornado swept through @entity127 , @entity128 , in 1970 , killing 26 people and demolishing scores of homes . @entity44 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms in addition , it is difficult to make basements compliant with the @entity137 , said @entity121 , who is on the research faculty at the school 's @entity139 . above - ground storm shelters are easy to make accessible to those who are physically challenged , " and i would say that accessibility is a very important element , " @entity121 said . specially reinforced safe rooms provide " near absolute occupant protection from even the worst - case tornado , " he said . opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? other products include steel , concrete and plastic shelters ; above - ground and below - ground shelters ; indoor and outdoor shelters ; and shelters that fit underneath the garage slab . the extra cost of incorporating a basement into plans for a house depends on where it is being built . " if you 're in the colder climates , then one has to put the foundation walls several feet deep to get below the frost line , " @entity121 said . a region 's frost line marks where the ground no longer freezes and is an important variable when installing pipes . the added cost of digging down the extra couple of feet needed to make a basement for a house in the @entity179 is relatively small , he said . " if you 're that deep , you 're pretty well along forming the shell for the basement . " but in the @entity184 , where the frost line is only about 18 inches below ground , the added incremental cost of digging out a basement would be far steeper , said the @entity128 . " here , houses are typically built by placing a slab on the surface and building above it . " opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado lessons to be learned @entity121 is also executive director of the @entity194 , a nonprofit group that focuses on improving the quality of storm shelters . he was planning tuesday to organize teams to travel to @entity20 to study which structures failed and which performed well . " there 's a lot of lessons we can learn from this , " he said . @entity121 said he had heard news reports citing underground shelters as the only safe places monday in @entity20 . " that causes my blood to curdle , because i 've spent my career developing safe places above ground , " he said . monday 's disaster is expected to lead to renewed calls to ensure that new houses are equipped with some sort of protection , said @entity218 , president and ceo of the @entity220 . but do n't count on them to effect change . " what happens is that time and fading memories are the worst enemies , " she said . " people think it ca n't happen twice , but in the case of @entity20 , @entity232 , the tragedy here is this is the third strike -- 1999 to 2003 . " after each of those strikes , homebuilders pledged never again to build homes without including safe rooms , she said . though many followed through on their vows , more work remains , she noted . opinion : we love and fear the @entity232 skies	@entity22:Basement Contractors	@entity23:Edmond	@entity20:Moore	@entity21:Hancock	@entity82:Barnett	@entity139:National Wind Institute	@entity137:Americans with Disabilities Act	@entity232:Oklahoma	@entity0:CNN	@entity179:Northeast	@entity194:National Storm Shelter Association	@entity218:Leslie Chapman-Henderson	@entity12:Oklahoma City	@entity100:Bosnia	@entity128:Texan	@entity127:Lubbock	@entity93:Autumn Oaks	@entity123:Texas Tech.	@entity121:Kiesling	@entity220:Federal Alliance for Safe Homes	@entity184:Southwest	@entity44:EF5
protesters say they will collect 1,000 liters of blood tuesday to throw at @placeholder	@entity60	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- prime minister @entity3 rejected protesters ' demands monday that he call an early election and dissolve parliament , saying on national television that he would listen to the protesters but would not be forced to accede to their demands . the rejection came after another largely peaceful day of demonstration during which thousands of red - shirted protesters called for a blood bath of sorts -- organizing a blood drive and threatening to spatter hundreds of liters of donated blood over government buildings and the prime minister 's residence . @entity3 spent much of monday morning holed up in a safe house in a military compound , which was surrounded by protesters . he left by helicopter in order to survey the situation , after which the protesters left the site . the protests , which were expected to continue tuesday , have hurt the economy . the nation 's tourism minister estimated the demonstrations might have resulted in a 20 percent drop in tourists . the impact on @entity38 visitors appears to have been greater , with the @entity38 @entity39 reporting a 50 percent cancellation rate . " red shirts " rally in @entity0 : share your photos the protesters , who are trying to bring down the prime minister 's administration , announced the blood drive an hour after @entity3 ignored a demand by the " red shirts " -- named for their clothing -- to dissolve parliament by noon monday . @entity53 -- one of the leaders of the anti-government @entity55 -- said the protesters will collect 1,000 liters ( 1 million cubic centimeters ) of blood tuesday and then throw it on the grounds of the @entity60 , which houses ministerial offices . if @entity3 still refuses to dissolve parliament , the demonstrators said , they will collect another 1,000 liters of blood the next day and splash it on the headquarters of the ruling party . the next day , they will collect 1,000 more liters and target the prime minister 's residence , the demonstrators said . the anti-government demonstrations began friday . by sunday , tens of thousands of protesters had poured into the center of @entity0 . the rallies have been largely peaceful . @entity3 said monday that his government will not use force to quell the demonstrations . army col. @entity78 said a number of grenades were tossed from a side street into the 11th @entity83 headquarters , where the @entity84 for the @entity85 is coordinating the government response to the protests . two soldiers were hurt , the colonel said . the protesters are supporters of former prime minister @entity91 , who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006 . @entity91 was the only @entity1 prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular . he fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated . the protesters say @entity3 was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections . about 50,000 security forces were mobilized ahead of the protests and additional soldiers were guarding @entity3 . since @entity91 's ouster , @entity1 has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted @entity91 loyalists against @entity3 supporters . two people were killed and at least 135 wounded in riots in april 2009 when protesters clashed with demonstrators supporting the government . @entity2 's @entity112 contributed to this report	@entity3:Abhisit Vejjajiva	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Thailand	@entity0:Bangkok	@entity39:Chamber of Commerce	@entity38:Chinese	@entity60:Government House	@entity53:Nattawut Saikua	@entity83:Infantry	@entity84:Center	@entity78:Sansern Kaewkumnerd	@entity55:United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship	@entity85:Administration of Peace and Order	@entity123:Infantry Headquarters	@entity91:Thaksin Shinawatra	@entity112:Kocha Olarn
@entity1 was n't taken seriously until he won acquittals at @placeholder 's murder trial	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the workhorse lawyer who won acquittals for @entity3 at the most - watched murder trial in years , may be either the best criminal defense attorney in @entity5 -- or the luckiest . it took him eight years to convince the @entity9 @entity8 to let him practice law , and he 'd been trying cases for just three years when the @entity13 case came along . many observers of the seven - week murder trial said he was in over his head and predicted doom . the judge scolded him so often he became the bad boy of @entity20 . bloggers and trial watchers took to calling him " @entity23 . " in the end , none of the digs mattered because @entity1 got results . convicted and pilloried in the court of public opinion , @entity13 was cleared of all murder - related charges in a court of law . whether by luck or by skill , @entity1 suddenly is looking less like a clown and more like the @entity37 version of late legal legend @entity38 . they 're calling him " @entity40 . " in a lengthy interview with " in session " in april , the 42 - year - old @entity1 recalled being in law school and ducking out of class to watch @entity46 's televised murder trial . @entity38 became one of his heroes . " i could win this case and i could win several more , and i still could n't accomplish what @entity38 did in his time practicing law , " @entity1 said . " i do n't like the comparison , because i do n't deserve it . " @entity1 entered the @entity13 case as an unknown , but his status skyrocketed overnight after her acquittal . now , he has an agent to field calls from @entity61 and invitations to sail on @entity64 's yacht . the new darling of the cable chat circuit is remarkably ordinary , the type of low - budget , constantly hustling defense attorney found in courthouses everywhere -- working the calendar calls , the jails , the bail bondsmen in a constant search for clients . that 's how he came to meet @entity3 . " apparently there were a couple of people in the jail that gave her my name , referred me to her , " he said . " i 've built up a hard reputation of fighting for my clients . 100 % of my business comes from referrals . i do n't advertise , i do n't have television ads or billboards or anything like that and i never have . " @entity13 recalled her decision during a recorded jailhouse visit with her parents . the recording was played at the trial : " it kind of happened at random in booking , " she said . " i heard a couple of people talking about attorneys . his name came up and i said , ' if he 's good , can you do me a favor and pass my name along ? ' " @entity1 had to listen in court as the parents expressed their doubts about him in another recorded visit . " i just hope that the compassion that he says he has is genuine , " said @entity13 , an ex-cop . " i hope he 's not building a reputation for himself . " here 's how @entity1 bills himself on his law firm 's web site : " aggressive , experienced , @entity119 . " but the site does n't let visitors read his biography or the cases it highlights : " high profile murder trial ; " " taking on the mayor ; " " @entity126 accused of kidnapping ; " and " state trooper cleared . " click on any of them , and you are returned to the top of the home page . " i relate to people , " he said in the " @entity135 " interview , conducted before the trial began . " people make mistakes . we all have erasers on our pencils . we 've all done some stupid things in life that should not define us . " like his clients , @entity1 has acquired a few scuffs and dings . he was born in @entity147 in 1969 and raised by a single mother in @entity149 and the @entity150 . he dropped out of @entity149 's @entity151 his freshman year and married at 17 when he learned he would be a father . " when i found out i was going to be a father , i decided i had to man up and accept responsibility and take care of my child . so at 17 , i joined the @entity157 , " he said . " it 's amazing what a child does to you . " he earned his ged and later attended @entity162 and @entity163 . law school was almost an afterthought . asked why he decided to go law school at @entity167 , he responded , " a girl . " he had to wait eight years for admission to @entity170 , according to public records . a @entity9 @entity8 ruling in 2000 highlights the @entity170 's concerns about " @entity176 's " character and finances , citing his failure to pay child support and other debts and expenditures such as signing up for a gym membership he could n't afford . ( all bar matters refer to the candidates by their initials , and @entity1 's struggle with the @entity170 has been widely reported . he declined to discuss the incident in detail with " @entity135 . " ) while he waited for admission to the bar , he worked as an intern for the @entity192 , taught lawyers to conduct research and launched four companies , including two that sold bathing suits ; @entity199 bikinis and @entity200 . " there 's no better place for a young lawyer to learn how to be a lawyer than the @entity192 , " he said . " i was surrounded by great lawyers ... there is a culture there of really learning how to fight for your client and if you 're not a fighter , then you do n't belong there . " he finally was admitted to the bar in 2005 , and began to practice in @entity214 and nearby @entity215 , where he lives in a gated community overlooking a golf course and a lake . before the @entity13 case , @entity1 said , he tried more than 45 cases , including four alleging murder . none of his clients had been convicted of first - degree murder , he boasted . he is most confident about his ability to outwork the opposition . " if i can do that , then i stand a chance and that is my goal , " he said during the " @entity135 " interview . though he has been criticized for the celebratory nature of the defense team 's gathering after the verdict -- cameras caught members dancing and drinking champagne -- @entity1 has mostly avoided the white light of fame . when he first took on the @entity13 case and camera crews began staking out his office , he made them park across the street . he said he does n't watch news reports about his cases anymore . " you 're one day practicing law and you 're occasionally on the 11 o'clock news . the next day you 're in the middle of this blood sport , " he said . " and you become a story . " a lot of times , he added , that story is exaggerated or simply not true . " i had a stomachache once , " he recalled . " i went to the hospital , and it was on the national news the next day that i was freaking out or something along those lines . i think ( the reports said ) i was caving under pressure and i might be quitting and things like that , and it really was just bad @entity266 food . " it is not clear how much he has been paid to represent @entity13 , although he could be in line for a percentage of any book or movie deals stemming from the case . suffice it to say that given the time he has put into the case , his hourly rate dips well below the minimum wage . but he ca n't put a price on the satisfaction he felt after @entity3 was acquitted of murdering her daughter . " when i get home tonight and my daughter asked what i did today , i can say i saved a life , " @entity1 told reporters after the verdict . " my driving force the last three years has been to make sure there has been justice for @entity3 and @entity288 , because @entity288 did not murder @entity3 . it 's that simple .

@placeholder is the most successful manager in @entity0 football	@entity3	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- having won 24 trophies in 23 seasons , @entity3 has established himself as the most successful manager in @entity8 football history . sir @entity3 : @entity0 football 's most successful manager with 24 titles but the 67 - year - old @entity13 manager , who has brought 10 league titles to the @entity15 in his time there , established his name in football long before he moved to the @entity21 club in 1986 . born @entity3 in @entity22 on @entity23 1941 , @entity3 started his playing career as an amateur at @entity27 side @entity28 when he was just 16 , while working as an apprentice tool - worker at the local shipyards . his first move as a player was to @entity33 , where he secured his big break . @entity3 scored a hat - trick in an unlikely win against top side @entity37 and in the summer of 1964 @entity38 offered him his first professional contract . @entity3 went on to score 66 goals for @entity38 before a move to @entity37 . in 1969 he was blamed for a goal through which @entity37 lost the @entity43 . he eventually left and ended his playing career with stints at @entity46 and @entity47 . at just 32 , @entity3 secured his first coaching contract with @entity49 . he managed to bring an improvement in the team 's results and soon moved to @entity53 -- where he would enjoy his first major success . @entity3 brought the struggling second division team into the top flight , where they claimed the first division title in 1977 . @entity58 was the next challenge for @entity3 -- and it was here that he established himself as a world - class manager . see top moments from @entity3 's management career ¬ª in 1980 he claimed the @entity27 league crown with @entity58 -- the first time in 15 years it had not been won by @entity37 or @entity65 . @entity66 continued , and in the 1982 - 83 season he remarkably took @entity58 to @entity68 glory , beating @entity70 giants @entity69 2 - 1 in the final . @entity3 joined @entity13 in 1986 where , in his 23 years at the club , he has won the @entity73 10 times , the @entity75 five times , the @entity78 twice and the @entity77 once . despite some low points -- particularly in late 1989 , when many believed he might be sacked after a terrible start to the season -- @entity3 has managed a team which has enjoyed consistent success through a period of rapid change in football . he has also nurtured players like @entity89 and @entity90 , bringing them to the top of their game . his success has not gone unnoticed off the field either . he has won the @entity96 accolade on four occasions and was knighted by @entity98 in 1999 , following his induction as both an officer and @entity101 . on a personal note , he has been married to wife @entity103 since 1966 and they have three sons . @entity106 is the current manager of @entity0 third - tier club @entity107 . at 67 , it is not certain how much longer @entity3 has left in the game and has hinted in recent years that he might step down . but , as he steers his team towards potentially another @entity73 title this season , there is no doubting how he will be remembered : one of the greatest football managers ever .	@entity22:Glasgow	@entity23:New Year 's Eve	@entity21:Old Trafford	@entity27:Scottish	@entity28:Queen 's Park	@entity98:Queen Elizabeth	@entity15:Red Devils	@entity89:David Beckham	@entity3:Ferguson	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:LONDON	@entity0:English	@entity8:British	@entity53:St. Mirren	@entity78:European Champions League	@entity75:FA Cup	@entity77:FIFA Club World Cup	@entity58:Aberdeen	@entity70:Spanish	@entity73:Premier League	@entity33:St Johnstone	@entity13:Manchester United	@entity37:Rangers	@entity38:Dunfermline	@entity43:Scottish Cup Final	@entity101:Commander of the Order of the British Empire	@entity103:Cathy	@entity106:Darren	@entity107:Peterborough	@entity96:World Soccer Magazine World Manager of the Year	@entity90:Cristiano Ronaldo	@entity46:Falkirk	@entity47:Ayr United	@entity68:European Cup Winners ' Cup	@entity69:Real Madrid	@entity66:Success	@entity65:Celtic	@entity49:East Stirlingshire
moons @entity48 , @placeholder , and @entity50 are covered with solid water ice	@entity49	( @entity0 ) -- as the curiosity rover begins its exciting trek across the surface of @entity4 and up the dramatic peak of @entity6 . @entity8 it is important to realize that the plans for this great success were incubated and acted upon more than 10 years ago . exploration like this is not for the faint of heart -- it takes time and persistence . so what 's next ? what is in the funded pipeline now that will be revolutionizing our understanding of life in the solar system 10 or even 20 years from now ? the short answer is -- nothing . curiosity is it . after @entity28 there is , at present , no other mission in production that will explore potentially habitable worlds beyond @entity33 . but where do we want to go ? where do we hope we 'll be ? along with continuing our exploration of @entity4 there are several moons of @entity40 and @entity41 that we think might be good places for life . these moons -- worlds with names like @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 -- are covered with solid water ice , beneath which we have very good reason to believe that vast liquid water oceans exist . and when i say liquid water i mean good old - fashioned @entity59 ; if you drank this stuff it would probably taste similar to a big gulp of salty ocean water from our ocean here on @entity33 . these are oceans that exist today and have likely been in existence for much of the history of the solar system . why is this important ? well , if we 've learned anything about life on @entity33 it 's that where you find liquid water you generally find life . these moons have lots and lots of water and they could be great homes for alien ecosystems ( note that when i say " alien ecosystems " i 'm referring primarily to microbes and simple life forms . as much as i 'd love to discover creatures like those seen in the movie @entity85 , i 'll be happy just to find a considerable speck of a microbe ! ) one moon in particular -- @entity40 's @entity92 -- may have the perfect combination of liquid water and the chemistry needed for life . @entity48 is about the size of our @entity98 and beneath its icy shell @entity92 harbors a global liquid water ocean of roughly 100 km in depth ( by comparison , @entity33 's ocean has an average depth of 4 km and a maximum depth of 11 km ) . the ocean of @entity48 contains about 2 - 3 times the volume of all the liquid water on @entity33 . it 's an ocean that 's there today and has likely been in existence for much of the 4.6 billion years of our @entity115 's history . as such , @entity48 provides an incredibly compelling place to go to search for a second , independent origin of life and it 's a place where we might find lifeforms that are alive now , today . this is important for two reasons . first , we need to know if the origin of life is easy or hard . does life arise wherever the conditions are right or is it a rare occurrence in our @entity126 ? second , all life on @entity33 -- from microbes to man -- runs on the same fundamental biochemistry of @entity131 , @entity132 , and proteins . see also : the search for dark matter we want to probe the question of whether or not there exists another way to get the " business " of life done . is there another game in town beyond the biochemistry we see here on @entity33 ? by going to @entity48 we can address both of these fundamental questions . @entity4 may have once been habitable but on @entity4 we are looking for signs of life trapped in the rocks ( essentially molecular fossils of microbes ) . in addition , @entity4 and the @entity33 are so close that asteroid impacts in the past might have seeded either world with life from the other . @entity48 is likely too far away for this kind of interplanetary " seeding . " more : what we 've done on @entity4 , and what 's next why do we even think that life could exist on @entity48 ? here 's where the exploration of our own ocean serves as an important guide . for much of human history we have focused on discovering new lands and exploring continents . for the most part , we 've only skimmed across the top of the ocean . but in the spring of 1977 explorers cruising the dark depths of our ocean discovered that active geological regions on the ocean 's floor -- known as hydrothermal vents -- were home to vibrant ecosystems of organisms large and small . these are ecosystems that thrive despite the tremendous pressure , and despite the lack of energy directly from the @entity191 the base of the foodchain down there is not photosynthesis but rather chemosynthesis , since the microbes are deriving energy from the chemistry of the hydrothermal vents fluid . the discovery of ecosystems in the deepest parts of our ocean is continuing to change our understanding of habitable environments here on @entity33 , and also of potentially habitable environments beyond @entity33 . on @entity48 we expect that the temperature , pressure , and chemistry of the seafloor might not be that different from our own ocean 's seafloor . in the decades to come our pipeline of exploration must include rigorous exploration of our own ocean so as to better understand the fundamental geological and biological cycles here on @entity33 . this research has the added benefit of feeding forward into our efforts to explore potentially habitable oceans in the far reaches of our solar system . but some may ask : why ? why do these things ? granted , this is not going to change the way you make your coffee in the morning . sure , there are spinoff technologies and many jobs created but that is not at the heart of why we do these things . the drumbeat of human civilization is the pursuit of new knowledge . we explore , we discover , and we advance . from fundamental research on cancer to revolutionizing our understanding of the universe , it is not an either / or : we must do it all . anything less is a sign that our priorities as a race have been hijacked by agendas beneath our potential . as has become a refrain in my community , the drumbeat continues and we echo the wise words of @entity257 : dare mighty things . read more about space and science on @entity0 's @entity262 blog the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .	@entity28:Curiosity	@entity265:Hand	@entity115:Solar System	@entity85:The Abyss	@entity257:Teddy Roosevelt	@entity131:DNA	@entity132:RNA	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Mt	@entity4:Mars	@entity8:Sharp	@entity191:Sun.	@entity50:Titan	@entity59:H2O	@entity33:Earth	@entity98:Moon	@entity126:Universe	@entity92:Europa	@entity262:Light Years	@entity40:Jupiter	@entity41:Saturn	@entity48:Europa	@entity49:Enceladus
formula one world champion @placeholder extends his deal with @entity4	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- three - time formula one world champion @entity1 has extended his deal with @entity4 through to the end of the 2015 season . the @entity7 is on course for a fourth straight drivers ' championship title after victory at the @entity13 @entity12 on sunday saw him extend his lead at the top of the standings to 36 points . @entity1 has reigned supreme over the sport since landing his first title in 2010 and has now added an extra 12 months onto his current deal . the 25 - year - old had been linked with rival marques such as @entity23 and @entity24 but has put an end to the speculation by signing a new contract .

in addition to 1 killed , 5 are injured in @entity44 , @placeholder , the state says	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- a powerful storm system rumbled through @entity2 and other parts of the @entity4 on thursday , spawning a tornado that killed one person and injured others . at least seven counties in @entity2 and four in @entity9 suffered damage as storms from the system rolled through and damaged homes and businesses , according to officials in those states . @entity18 's emergency management agency also reported trees down in several counties in that state on thursday night . this occurred hours after a weak tornado snapped large limbs and caused power outages around @entity26 on @entity28 's @entity27 , according to the @entity29 . a slew of tornado warnings and watches were issued and , in due time , expired over the course of the day thursday . still , some watches -- portending a threat of large hail and damaging wind -- remained in effect through friday morning in parts of @entity18 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity9 and @entity42 . the area that suffered the most thursday was @entity44 , @entity2 , on the @entity9 border . that 's where one person died after strong winds destroyed a steel building along @entity50 , the @entity29 reported . the @entity51 later reported that five people were injured and several homes were damaged in that county . in neighboring @entity56 , the weather agency said , a " violent and extremely dangerous " tornado was spotted near the city of @entity59 . city clerk @entity60 said electricity had been knocked out in @entity59 . there were reports of damaged homes and businesses about 10 miles south in @entity66 , a town of about 500 people . across the border in @entity70 , @entity9 , radar indicated a tornado set down and the county emergency management director , @entity73 , said a path of damage had been left behind in the northwestern part of the county , which borders @entity2 . of course , such hazardous springtime weather is hardly an anomaly in many of these areas . a cool march meant that there had been significantly fewer tornadoes this year compared with previous ones , @entity0 's weather unit noted . but that does n't mean storms will be less powerful , or that the rest of the season will be slow . just ask the people of @entity92 , @entity93 , where at least 24 homes sustained severe damage from storms wednesday night , the @entity90 said . is severe weather happening near you ? share your story one tornado touched down in the @entity90 suburb , ripping the roofs off of several homes , @entity100 @entity99 said . no serious injuries were immediately reported . watch as tornado approaches @entity92 resident @entity107 spent the night in her bathroom as the storm moved through . when she woke up thursday , " it was pitch black and i started having a panic attack , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity112 . " i looked outside , and it got worse . " what she saw were downed trees and power lines . her home was without electricity or water . " it looks like a war zone , it does n't look like my home , " she told @entity112 . @entity107 walked half a mile to an elementary school where the @entity124 had set up . after the warning sirens went off wednesday night , @entity125 decided to walk to the back of his house , where he thought he would be safe , but the tornado beat him to it . as he was walking through the house , there was a loud pop , then flying glass before he rose off the ground and was thrown on his kitchen floor . debris from the ceiling fell , and then it was quiet , he told @entity112 . " the wind just picked me up and moved me that far across my kitchen , " he said . gov. @entity142 declared a state of emergency in @entity93 after the series of storms pummeled the @entity90 area and elsewhere across the state . @entity148 was also hard hit , prompting gov. @entity149 to declare 15 counties as state disaster areas . the damage in @entity148 included some 15 homes damaged in @entity154 , said state emergency management official @entity155 , and overturned vehicles spotted along @entity158 65 , north of @entity159 . one tornado touched down in @entity161 , about 75 miles north of @entity162 , damaging at least 33 homes and injuring three people . the twister demolished the sanctuary , a fellowship area , classrooms and a pavilion at @entity172 , its pastor said . " if the tornado would have come an hour and a half later , we would have been caught in it , " said senior pastor @entity173 , referring to wednesday night services . no members of the church were injured . but a passing motorist who parked his truck in the church 's covered driveway to get out of the dangerous weather had a close call when the storm struck . " it shook the truck and just lifted the roof right off the drive - through , " said @entity173 . " he was all right . " @entity173 , 63 , said his congregation of about 100 was left stunned . " it is just devastating . my wife and i are just torn , " he said . " we put a lot of sweat and hard work and it was paying off . the church was growing . " as church leaders prepared to meet with their insurance adjuster , the pastor was thankful for a loyal membership . " they will be with me , " he said . " they are ready to buckle down and do what we have to . with the @entity210 's help , we are going to rebuild .

call comes from leading anti-apartheid activist @placeholder	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- its record on dealing with racist abuse has been mixed and now @entity4 has been urged by a leading anti-apartheid activist to show a tougher approach to the issue ahead of hosting the 2018 @entity8 . the man who led @entity12 's successful @entity8 bid in 2010 , @entity9 wants @entity4 to start implementing life bans for any players or individuals found guilty of racism within football . " given our own history as @entity12 as a country and given our struggle against apartheid and racism ... this is an issue that @entity4 must give serious attention to , " @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity18 . in the past , @entity29 sports minister @entity28 has insisted there is no major racism problem in the country , though earlier this month @entity34 coach @entity33 said he did want to sign a @entity35 because the club has " enough dark - skinned players , we 've got six of the things . " @entity33 , who apologized for his comments , was given a five - game ban . during this season 's @entity41 leading @entity29 club @entity40 has had to play its games behind closed doors because of fan abuse toward black players . that punishment was handed out by @entity49 governing body @entity48 . and in an interview with the @entity54 , @entity52 anti-racism adviser @entity50 suggested black players might even boycott the 2018 @entity8 , saying " there are certain parts [ of @entity57 where ] if you are my color it 's unsafe . " @entity9 , who began to campaign against apartheid in the 1970s , argued there should be " no compromise " on the issue of racism in football . " you 've already seen the response from some of the leading players on the @entity71 continent , " said @entity9 . " we will certainly , at the level of the @entity73 and @entity52 , raise these issues because we can not see the same teams there that will be subjected to racial abuse and threats . " @entity9 pointed to the @entity80 's leadership in dealing with @entity82 co-owner @entity81 , banning him for life after privately taped racist remarks were leaked to celebrity website @entity87 . " in our own country we opposed both legislation and the conduct of racists in our country -- they must be confronted , " added @entity9 , referring to his own country 's history in dealing with apartheid . " it must be dealt with severely . there must be decisive and very strong action . " such individuals certainly have no right to take charge of human - beings if the understanding is not that every human - being has equal worth . there are no players and things in the same team -- it 's just unacceptable .

" " we in @entity14 await tangible and urgent measures in the near future , " he said . similar sentiments were voiced in @entity37 by @entity39 foreign minister @entity38 after his recent visit to @entity5 . he told reporters in a televised news conference he had asked that the @entity3 military end operations immediately , withdraw from cities and meet the democratic demands of the people . " @entity3 people should know that we are on their side with regard to their legitimate democratic rights , " he said . " we hope our voice is heard and these operations are stopped . " in @entity57 , @entity56 , @entity39 president @entity55 met monday with @entity58 and both " underscored the significance of halting the violence the @entity3 administration is resorting to against people , " @entity55 's office said in a statement . last week , @entity58 called for an end to the bloodshed in @entity3 and recalled the @entity56 ambassador from @entity5 . @entity67 and @entity68 also have recalled their ambassadors from @entity3 and called on @entity3 president @entity71 to end the crackdowns . the @entity73 has stopped short of explicit calls for @entity71 to step down , but @entity75 has said @entity3 would be better off without him . the @entity73 slapped sanctions on @entity3 's largest mobile phone company and a bank , while calling for an oil and gas embargo . the international entreaties and condemnations came as more than 5,000 @entity83 were reported to have fled a @entity85 refugee camp in the port city of @entity87 after the camp came under fire from @entity3 security forces . some of the refugees had been asked to leave by the @entity3 security forces , and some left on their own because they were afraid for their lives , said @entity94 , spokesman for the @entity95 . the agency had had no communication with the refugees , and was not sure where they had gone , he said . " we are asking the @entity3 government for immediate access to the @entity83 , as their well - being is our responsibility , " @entity94 told @entity0 . " we need to get in there to assess the situation . " the refugee camp in @entity87 normally holds 10,000 people . " reports from various sources indicate deaths and casualties among the @entity83 refugee population , although poor communications make it impossible to confirm the exact number of dead and injured , " the agency said sunday . it demanded access to the area so that humanitarian workers can take care of the casualties . also monday , a day after opposition groups told @entity0 that @entity3 security forces backed by gunships killed at least 25 people in a crackdown on protesters in @entity87 , security forces began urging residents to evacuate or risk being arrested or killed , an activist there told @entity0 . gunfire and explosions could be heard monday , said the resident , who lives outside the @entity137 neighborhood , which has been the focus of the military campaign . monday was the third consecutive day that the area has had neither power nor water , he said . at one checkpoint , security forces shot at fleeing residents , killing six , the @entity143 said . another man was killed monday by sniper fire in the @entity151 province town of @entity152 , which was besieged by tanks on all sides , and pro-regime " thugs " entered surrounding villages , it said . government - run media have denied the claims of civilian casualties . the @entity143 also said monday that it had learned that in the city of @entity151 , relatives of a detained man received his body , which had been tortured . there have been at least 10 such deaths since the beginning of the holy month of @entity168 on august 1 , the agency said . " the observatory holds the security forces officials who held them responsible for their death under torture and calls for their trial so they can be punished for the crimes they have committed against the @entity3 people , " it said in a statement . it said more than 700 people have been taken into custody in " random " arrest campaigns since @entity168 got under way . violence countrywide took at least 42 lives sunday , said one anti-government activist group , which collects lists of victims ' names . @entity0 can not independently verify opposition or government claims , because @entity3 has restricted international journalists from reporting inside the country . the crackdown in @entity87 is the latest in a series of military actions , coinciding with the @entity197 holy month of @entity168 , that are targeting protesters calling for free elections and the ouster of @entity71 . the @entity202 also reported deaths in the cities of @entity205 and @entity206 . in all , 2,530 people have died since the uprising began in march , according to the @entity209 of @entity3 . most were civilians , while 391 belonged to @entity3 's security forces , it says . @entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .	@entity25:Safar	@entity83:Palestinian	@entity85:U.N.	@entity87:Latakia	@entity152:Al Houla	@entity137:al-Ramel	@entity151:Homs	@entity3:Syria	@entity215:Nada Husseini	@entity216:Yesim Comert	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Damascus	@entity213:Amir Ahmed	@entity197:Muslim	@entity57:Jeddah	@entity56:Saudi	@entity55:Gul	@entity75:Washington	@entity58:King Abdullah	@entity71:al-Assad	@entity73:United States	@entity16:Adel Safar	@entity15:Al Bakhit	@entity14:Jordan	@entity12:Petra News Agency	@entity37:Ankara	@entity39:Turkish	@entity38:Ahmet Davutoglu	@entity209:Local Coordinating Committees	@entity214:Arwa Damon	@entity202:Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union	@entity95:U.N.

one @placeholder dog sled race is available to novices and experienced competitors alike	@entity50	( @entity0 ) yeah , yeah , we know that hot cocoa 's great ( hello , brandy hot chocolate is a thing ) , but winter is the only season when you can jump around in snow like a little kid and not look like a drunken fool . turn off the " @entity13 " reruns , put on your marshmallowy - est puffy jacket , and go outside ! here are our six recommendations for snowy competitions to watch or compete in , if you 're brave enough to try . @entity18 , @entity19 ( january 22 - 25 ) shaping and carving snow is one thing , but actually dealing with the thick blankets covering the ground is an art in and of itself . at the fifth annual @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity19 , the event coordinators have cleverly made a competition that is actually exciting and entertaining out of just cleaning up snow . competitors -- often college students -- design , develop and build their own snowplows . and if that is n't impressive enough , the machines must be controlled electronically during the competition . each snowplow navigates a course and clears a designated path in the snow . visitors can watch in awe ( and maybe with just a teensy bit of jealousy ) as the teams are judged on their creations ' designs , presentations and performances . @entity49 , @entity50 ( january 24 - 25 ) the @entity51 are the perfect event for any snow lover or dog lover . if you prefer to keep the beasts at a safe distance , you can appreciate their power and agility while watching them speed through the snow . if giving plenty of cuddles and kisses is more your speed , head over to the petting zoo for a more personal experience . the @entity70 race is open to everyone : professional racers , kids and teams with mixed breed dogs . if this show of speed and control still does n't impress you , watch the skijoring races , where people must not only balance on skis but be simultaneously pulled across the snow by dogs . it 's very impressive to those of us who ca n't even manage to get the knack of " normal " skiing . @entity90 @entity89 , @entity91 ( january 26 - 31 ) if you see a blank sheet of snow as merely fodder for a massive snowball fight , the 2015 @entity90 @entity89 in @entity92 , @entity91 , will blow your mind . at this prestigious event , artists showcase their ability to tame blocks of snow into stunning masterpieces . they work with ladders and scaffolds to gently carve and smooth their blocks until the image within shines through . the single - block sculptures are larger than life , often standing even taller than the artist , but they must fit within a 12 - foot circle . these sculptors are the best of the best . the winners of each state competition come to @entity92 to vie for the winning title . the winner also receives an invitation to compete in the @entity120 sur @entity121 - sanctioned @entity89 . @entity122 , @entity123 ( february 2 - 15 ) if you 're one of those @entity127 fans who has to catch each mogul and every exhilarating run down the slopes , just imagine how incredible it would be to watch it all in person . at the 2015 @entity122 , you will be able to admire every snowflake and gasp along with the crowd -- and every devastating wipeout -- as the world 's most talented skiers navigate the slopes . even if skiing is n't really your thing , the town of @entity140 will be the perfect winter wonderland during early february . musical phenoms @entity144 & @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity90 authors will all be performing during the championships . spend your free moments sampling @entity152 beers at the @entity153 or checking out the @entity154 , where each new day brings a whole new spread of international food and drinks . @entity158 , @entity159 ( february 6 - 8 ) at the @entity158 , the competitive tobogganing is a far cry from what most of us did sliding down our driveways on old cardboard boxes . here , the competition is fierce , and many of the sleek toboggans are handcrafted to ensure the fastest runs possible . although watching other people whiz down steep hills on small wooden planks is certainly entertainment enough , the town of @entity171 is offering a bevy of other kinds of entertainment during the weekend of the championship . test your culinary prowess at the @entity182 , show your creative talents during the @entity185 parade , and snuggle around the bonfire . for older guests , the 2nd @entity187 is the perfect way to mix the magic of snow and the magic of alcohol . taste a cornucopia of beers and wines , and vote for your favorite brewer as the alcohol keeps you from feeling the snow 's frosty bite . @entity201 , @entity202 ( february 6 - 13 ) perhaps you 've watched curling teams compete in the @entity127 and thought to yourself , " really ? that 's a sport ? " but just add a wheelchair into the equation , and the whole thing gets infinitely more impressive and more captivating . at the @entity209 in @entity202 , that 's just what you 'll see . only one new rule sets the wheelchair athletes apart from the traditional curling competitors : no sweeping . besides that , every skill and strategy is the same .	@entity26:ION Autonomous Snowplow Competition	@entity27:St. Paul	@entity159:Maine	@entity158:U.S. National Toboggan Championships	@entity152:Sierra Nevada	@entity153:Winter Beer Camp	@entity89:Snow Sculpting Competition	@entity201:World Wheelchair Curling Championship	@entity154:International Experience Celebration	@entity171:Camden	@entity0:CNN	@entity123:Colorado	@entity51:Cannington Dog Sled Races	@entity50:Canadian	@entity120:Association International de Sculpture	@entity121:Neige et Glace	@entity70:Ontario	@entity13:Law & Order	@entity19:Minnesota	@entity18:Autonomous Snowplow Competition	@entity209:World Wheelchair Curling Championship	@entity202:Finland	@entity127:Winter Olympics	@entity122:FIS Alpine World Ski Championships	@entity92:Lake Geneva	@entity91:Wisconsin	@entity90:American	@entity144:Michael Franti	@entity146:Spearhead	@entity147:Phillip Phillips	@entity140:Vail	@entity182:Chili Challenge	@entity185:Costume Contest	@entity187:Eva Down the Chute Beer & Wine Tasting	@entity49:Cannington Dog Sled Races
he says the agency had to broaden its role after @placeholder was attacked on 9/11	@entity35	( @entity0 ) -- on a hot summer day in early august , 2008 , the secure @entity3 phone in my office at @entity6 was lighting up with calls from national security adviser @entity8 . the @entity9 had invaded the @entity10 in the @entity12 mountain region . @entity10 president @entity13 was frantic about his country 's safety and desperate for information on @entity18 forces and @entity18 's intent . i promised @entity8 some answers , hung up the phone and walked to my outer office to direct my executive assistants to " get our @entity10 people up here right away . " as they busily dialed phones and typed e-mails , i remember turning to my chief of staff and only half jokingly asking him , " we 've got @entity10 people , right ? " i recall that day now as a debate has begun about the focus of the @entity35 intelligence community and especially of the @entity6 . in discussing his new book , " the way of the knife , " @entity37 national security correspondent @entity36 suggests that @entity6 's obsession with fighting terrorism might have blinded it to the inevitability , imminence and rapid spread of the @entity44 . in march , press reports said the president 's @entity48 , a panel of senior outside advisers , had come to much the same conclusion , accusing the intelligence community of too much focus on military operations and drone strikes at the expense of other targets such as @entity57 and the @entity58 . back in august 2008 , we did indeed have " @entity10 people , " and they were quite good . within a few days , the entire team was gathered around a conference table at @entity6 headquarters giving president @entity64 their personal appreciation of the situation . but precise tactical intelligence was hard to come by ( questions such as where exactly was the front line of @entity18 troops ) . recent technical collection systems had been developed and deployed for the counterterrorism target , not for tracking the successor to the @entity75 . and the fact that i had asked my half - joking question should suggest that neither the topic of @entity10 nor the " @entity10 people " were frequent visitors to my office . more broadly , when asked what were the priorities of the agency during my time there , i would respond with a bit of @entity87 - insider alphabet soup , " @entity90 , @entity89 , row . " translation : counterterrorism , counterproliferation ( mostly @entity94 ) , the rest of the world . the @entity35 intelligence community works hard against a variety of tough targets every day , but questions about current balance and emphasis are as understandable as they are inevitable . the demands of more than a decade of constant war have clearly had their impact . much of what passes for analysis today is really targeting : targeting an individual for direct action , targeting an individual for increased collection , targeting an individual to make sure he does n't board an aircraft en route to the @entity35 . the @entity115 has always had two sides to its personality : a national enterprise that meets the needs of policymakers across the @entity35 government and one that serves as a combat support agency for the @entity123 of which it remains a part . even with a substantially increased budget , after more than a decade of combat , it should be clear that the battlefield support side of the agency 's personality has become increasingly dominant . since 2001 , @entity6 case officers have routinely been sent to war zones as their first operational assignment . they have performed magnificently . but the skills they have honed there are often different from the skills required for classical espionage and many are frankly bored when they return to more routine work where @entity141 and a personal weapon are not required equipment . @entity35 's singular focus on counterterrorism has also affected intelligence cooperation with allies . many simply do not agree with our legal position that this is a war and others object to tactics such as targeted killings and extraordinary renditions . although most appreciate that @entity35 actions have made them safer , the potential uses to which we could put their information strains intimacy and limits sharing . we occasionally have to pull our own punches . to what degree , for example , did we limit contacts ( intelligence or otherwise ) with the @entity164 in @entity166 's @entity165 so as not to risk the solid counterterrorism partnership with the regime ? some are now calling these actions a distortion of @entity35 intelligence , but none of these steps was inappropriate for the circumstances in which we found ourselves after 9/11 . indeed , i initiated some of them and supported all of them while in government . many of them need to continue . @entity184 's threat is diminished , not eliminated . @entity185 , former @entity186 official and head of the @entity188 , may have put it best when he suggested that what we need here is a dial , not a switch . and this is more than just an intelligence question . collection and analysis usually chase after the things that policymakers hold most dear . if their view is immediate and tactical , much of their intelligence will follow . my " @entity10 people " were great . i should have paid more attention to them before august 2008 . priorities being what they were , i did n't . i was reflecting on this when , a few weeks before his confirmation hearing , i had breakfast with @entity215 . as we were leaving the table , i suggested that the @entity6 had never looked more like its wartime predecessor , @entity219 , than it did right then . that had made @entity35 safer , but i reminded the eneral that the @entity6 was not the @entity219 . it was the nation 's leading espionage and analytic service and that -- much as i did -- he would have to struggle to remember that every day . all this means that tough choices lie ahead , all of them fraught with risk , as the community deals with current dangers while also embracing broader and more enduring tasks . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .	@entity115:National Security Agency	@entity35:U.S.	@entity87:Washington	@entity89:CP	@entity3:Red Switch	@entity215:Dave Petraeus	@entity0:CNN	@entity236:Hayden	@entity6:CIA	@entity9:Russian Army	@entity8:Steve	@entity219:OSS	@entity10:Georgia	@entity57:China	@entity75:Red Army	@entity58:Middle East	@entity13:Mikheil Saakashvili	@entity12:Caucasus	@entity37:New York Times	@entity36:Mark Mazzetti	@entity18:Russian	@entity94:Iran	@entity123:Department of Defense	@entity90:CT	@entity188:Council on Foreign Relations	@entity166:Hosni Mubarak	@entity141:Kevlar	@entity164:Muslim Brotherhood	@entity165:Egypt	@entity184:Al Qaeda	@entity185:Richard Haass	@entity186:State Department	@entity44:Arab Awakening	@entity64:George W.

a camera inside a @placeholder car tapes the seven - minute , 12 - mile chase	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity3 police officer in a marked squad car has been charged with reckless driving , accused of zigzagging through @entity7 traffic at more than 120 miles an hour so that he could be on time for his off - duty job , the @entity1 said saturday . officer @entity10 , 35 , of @entity3 was handcuffed at gunpoint earlier this month and charged with second - degree reckless driving , a misdemeanor , according to the highway patrol 's offense report . @entity10 was eventually released , authorities said . in a pursuit videotaped on the trooper 's in - car camera , @entity10 led @entity7 highway patrol officer @entity21 on a seven - minute , almost 12 - mile chase in pre-dawn darkness on tuesday , october 11 , the report said . the state patrol officer was driving on the turnpike when the white marked @entity3 police car blew by at a high rate of speed and " crossed over all lanes of traffic , " the report said . the highway patrol officer could n't even overtake the @entity3 police car " due to the unit traveling extremely reckless , in and out of traffic at high rates of speed , in excess of 120 mph , " according to the report . the @entity3 cop ignored the state patrol officer 's siren and lights -- and even " accelerated " at times and continued changing lanes . at one point , the @entity3 officer slowed to 78 miles an hour , but sped up again , the highway patrol said . finally , the @entity3 officer , wearing his uniform , pulled over his squad car at 6:35 a.m. in @entity47 . a state highway patrol video shows the state trooper pulling out her service handgun as she approached the @entity3 police car with the officer seated behind the wheel . the @entity3 police officer " stated that he was en route to an off - duty work detail and that he had to be there by 7:00 a.m. , " @entity21 wrote in her report . on the @entity1 offense report , the document lists @entity10 's occupation as " police officer " whose employer is " @entity64 ( t ) " and lists the style of automobile as " police car , " a white 2008 @entity68 . a @entity3 police spokesman could n't be reached immediately for comment saturday . but @entity3 police detective @entity72 told @entity0 affiliate @entity73 in @entity3 that the department will determine whether to take any action against @entity10 after a judge rules on his case . the @entity7 is also designated as @entity78 91 , and the turnpike 's website nicknames the highway " the @entity82 .

@entity245 : gun rampages , like the one in @placeholder , have become routine	@entity24	( @entity0 ) -- how is it possible that @entity2 has not managed to come together and build an effective response to gun massacres ? how can that be ? if another country had sent a killer who massacred people at random in the streets of an @entity2 city , @entity5 would have rushed to emergency session and the public would have thrown its support behind forceful action . politicians , news media , community groups , everyone would be working in solidarity to combat the evil facing the nation . just imagine if it happened again and again . in @entity24 , @entity25 , a mass killing has shaken the nation . but every time we hear of another gunman 's rampage , @entity2 go straight into their comfort zone . for a few days , advocates of gun rights stiffen their spines and vehemently defend their turf . on the other side , gun control advocates brandish their arguments while relatives of the latest victims cry out in pain and despair . the discussion combusts and burns itself off with the usual ingredients : is the problem too many guns ? is it mental health ? is it guns in the hands of the wrong people ? yes , yes , yes to all of the above . each killing spree triggers other discussions . is it hatred for women , a breakdown of societal norms , too many video games , violence in movies ? by all means we should study , debate and analyze the many factors that contribute to violence . but first , it 's time to take the urgent action needed to stanch the bleeding , to at least slow the hemorrhage . opinion : i 'm a gun owner and i want gun control how can a country become accustomed to the idea that children may go to school one morning and never come home ? it happens over and over and over again . how can it become routine that anyone , anywhere , for no reason at all , can get killed by a mentally disturbed person ? at times , the entire country 's response to the endless stream of killings resembles the embarrassing stagnation of politicians in @entity91 . each side self - righteously preaches , firing up its own supporters , and nothing changes . politicians , by the way , have become useless in tackling the crisis . talking about guns is too risky . in 1999 , when two killers massacred more than a dozen , mostly teenagers , at @entity102 , the entire world was in shock . since then , the shootings have kept coming . at @entity106 , 32 people were killed . in @entity108 , @entity109 , 12 people were shot dead , 70 were injured . at @entity112 , 20 children and six staff members were killed . at a parking lot in @entity115 , @entity116 , a congresswoman was shot in the head . luckily , she survived , but others nearby were killed . there are two common denominators : guns and mental illness . can @entity2 set aside their differences and try to work out an agreement that will address this crisis ? can the two sides recognize the sorrow and pain that are spreading as they shout past one another ? gun enthusiasts do n't support mass murder . nobody does . that 's the fundamental common ground . can we have a moment to set aside strategic long - term political objectives -- just a brief interlude -- and work together to try to prevent more people with mental illness from arming themselves and killing the innocent ? here 's what i suggest . might the @entity143 , with all its political power , announce it is willing to speak with mental health specialists , law enforcement officials and gun control advocates to focus sharply on just this issue ? hold a summit , form a high - level committee , take the first step on the road to a solution . consider a few recent killing sprees . the @entity112 killer had serious mental health issues . the man who shot rep. @entity159 had dropped out of school after his college required a mental health evaluation . the @entity164 killer had been investigated by the university for stalking and had been declared mentally ill by a @entity106 special justice . the @entity24 shooter also had a history of mental illness . like many others mass shooters , he had given clear signs that he was extremely dangerous , planning to kill . he had had several encounters with police . his family had alerted the police to the danger . still , like all the other mass shooters before him , he was able to build an arsenal as he planned his rampage . things must change . the threshold for taking someone against their will for psychiatric evaluation needs to be lowered . police need better mental health training . it must become easier to intervene when there are risks . importantly , people who have mental illnesses that put them at risk of violence should be blocked from owning weapons . does anyone , even the most avid hunter , the most passionate gun enthusiast , think mentally ill people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons , or any weapons at all , for that matter ? opinion : let teens talk about mental illness beyond the area of mental health , there is much to be debated about whether a free society requires that its citizens be allowed to arm themselves so thoroughly , and whether an armed population makes for more or less crime . the @entity2 can learn from the experience of other countries where people maintain wide - ranging rights to carry weapons , but have taken measures that effectively brought an end to gun massacres . everyone is at risk now , people in every zip code , in every income level , of every race . a loved one could die in a random shooting out on the street or in a temple or a movie theater ; in a country club , or on a college campus . no one can honestly deny that it is a real crisis . @entity2 can take steps to start fixing this problem . gun lovers and gun control advocates can come together and craft a solution . show @entity91 that it can be done . show the world that @entity2 has the power to solve an urgent problem .	@entity2:U.S.	@entity0:CNN	@entity106:Virginia	@entity5:Congress	@entity24:Isla Vista	@entity25:California	@entity143:NRA	@entity102:Columbine High School	@entity115:Tuscon	@entity116:Arizona	@entity245:Frida Ghitis	@entity112:Sandy Hook	@entity159:Gabby Giffords	@entity109:Colorado	@entity108:Aurora	@entity164:Virginia Tech	@entity91:Washington	@entity248:Ghitis

new : @entity56 re-elected @entity57 speaker ; says @placeholder debt must be tamed	@entity70	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the bar has never been lower for the nearly 100 freshmen of the 113th @entity4 who were sworn - in on thursday . after all , it wo n't take much to exceed the abysmal approval rating of the previous @entity4 . despite the usual burst optimism of a freshman class on @entity10 and the sentiment to reach across the aisle and dissolve partisan gridlock , recent history shows those pledges are destined to falter like so many @entity16 's resolutions . " on the day people are sworn in they are entitled to dream , " said @entity17 , director of the @entity19 's @entity18 . " the idea that they are going to bridge the unbridgeable gap between the two parties is indeed a dream . " @entity27 signs fiscal cliff bill into law the new @entity4 faces many of the same stubborn issues that make bipartisanship in a politically divided country difficult to achieve . although @entity0 averted the worst aspects of the fiscal cliff earlier this week , the automatic spending cuts , or sequester , that were a centerpiece of that debate for months but cut out of the final deal at the last minute are coming around again in february . at about the same time , lawmakers will have to consider raising the nation 's debt ceiling , or the ability of the @entity43 to borrow money to pay the nation 's bills . both sides are already digging in on spending and debt . are days of @entity4 ' going big ' over ? a fresh controversy involves assistance to victims of @entity53 . an aid bill approved by the @entity55 was shelved on tuesday night by @entity57 speaker @entity56 over concerns that voting on a big spending package immediately after approving a fiscal cliff deal that excluded deficit reduction would send a bad political signal . @entity64 and @entity65 politicians were incensed at @entity56 's inaction , prompting @entity65 gov. @entity67 to growl : that this is " why the @entity70 people hate @entity4 . " a scaled - back version of $ 9 billion for immediate aid for flood insurance will be considered by both houses on friday . lawmakers will weigh the balance of the $ 60 billion plan later this month . furor over dropped vote for @entity53 aid defused further out on the horizon is an expected fight over gun control , a high priority for the @entity57 in the aftermath of the @entity86 school massacre that will face push - back from congressional members with high ratings and big - dollar donations from gun rights advocates . immigration reform , another @entity57 priority , will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in @entity4 . all in all , the sharp divisions on @entity10 are still evident and expectations for meaningful progress on substantive issues are not high . " my sense is that things are not going to be that different because the fundamental divisions that existed in the previous @entity4 are still there , " said @entity100 , a political science professor at @entity101 . @entity106 faces on @entity10 " we still have a @entity108 @entity55 and @entity109 @entity57 . we still have a divided @entity4 . the ideological divisions between the parties are as great as they were in the last @entity4 , " he said . the divide is widened by a continued attrition of moderates , who lost or retired from seats on both sides of the aisle in both chambers . but on the other side of the question there have been subtle shifts in numbers and other changes that could make a difference in how votes on some issues play out , political experts say . republicans retained control of the @entity57 in november but @entity132 gained seats there and expanded their control of the @entity55 . republicans now fill 234 seats in the new @entity57 , down from 242 . there are @entity132 , up from 193 . in the @entity55 , voters handed two former @entity109 seats to @entity132 for a new balance of 55 - 45 . the 55 @entity108 seats include two independents who caucus with the party . @entity145 makes emotional return after stroke for the first time , the @entity148 is dominated by women and racial minorities , while the @entity109 caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men . over in the @entity55 , 20 women √¢ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äù the largest number in history √¢ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äù will be sworn in . the increased diversity " means that we reflect @entity70 more , " said newly elected @entity159 @entity158 rep. @entity158 . " you know the district where i come from is a very diverse district , and it is good to see @entity4 starting to look more like the rest of @entity70 . and you see the demographic shifts that are happening across the country . " @entity171 remains strong , however , political experts say . " those things are interesting and it 's a good thing to have that diversity ... but just that party attached to the person 's name explains the roll call . it does n't matter the race or the gender . it 's the party affiliation , " @entity17 said . @entity56 , whose relationship with president @entity27 frayed further during the fiscal cliff negotiations , received the gavel again on thursday when he was re-elected to lead the chamber . while 220 of the @entity187 voted for the @entity189 lawmaker , a few members did n't answer , simply voted " present , " or cast ballots for other candidates . following the fiscal cliff fight , @entity56 is telling colleagues no more negotiating deals and that " regular order works best " from now on . @entity56 also signaled the upcoming debt showdown in remarks following his re-election , saying that taming debt was the most important thing for restoring long - term @entity70 economic health . " at $ 16 trillion and rising , our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state . @entity208 is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt . break its hold , and we begin to set our economy free , " he said . @entity56 , under fire from some conservatives , re-elected speaker @entity27 had stern words for the 113th @entity4 , warning lawmakers that he will not tolerate the kind of prolonged brinksmanship that defined the fiscal cliff saga . " while i will negotiate over many things , i will not have another debate with this @entity4 over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they 've passed , " he said shortly after the @entity57 passed the fiscal cliff bill . @entity27 calls for less ' drama , ' ' brinkmanship ' senate minority leader @entity231 responded sharply in an opinion piece for @entity233 , insisting that spending would be part of the debate over the debt ceiling . the incoming freshman class took notes on failures of the previous @entity4 in hopes of avoiding a repeat performance . incoming freshmen " learned a lot from what happened over the last few weeks with the fiscal cliff debacle , " freshman @entity245 @entity244 rep. @entity243 said on @entity1 , adding that the takeaway for a lot of his class is to strengthen bipartisan ties . " a lot of us come in with that mind frame , " he said . @entity257 : debt debate ' starts today ' @entity1 's @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .	@entity27:Obama	@entity159:Illinois	@entity158:Tammy Duckworth	@entity86:Connecticut	@entity257:McConnell	@entity259:Josh Levs	@entity187:234 House Republicans	@entity132:Democrats	@entity171:Partisanship	@entity233:Yahoo News	@entity1:CNN	@entity231:Mitch McConnell	@entity244:Democrat	@entity4:Congress	@entity53:Superstorm Sandy	@entity57:House	@entity56:John Boehner	@entity55:Senate	@entity70:U.S.	@entity17:Sabato	@entity16:New Year	@entity10:Capitol Hill	@entity19:University of Virginia	@entity18:Center for Politics	@entity100:Alan Abramowitz	@entity101:Emory University	@entity245:Texas	@entity0:Washington	@entity243:Joaquin Castro	@entity106:New	@entity108:Democratic	@entity109:Republican	@entity261:Holly Yan	@entity260:Tom Watkins	@entity263:Ashley Killough	@entity262:Robert Yoon	@entity189:Ohio	@entity148:House Democratic caucus	@entity145:Kirk	@entity208:The American Dream	@entity43:Treasury	@entity67:Chris Christie	@entity64:New York	@entity65:New Jersey
@placeholder , @entity201 : @entity4 should suggest less military spending on our allies	@entity200	( @entity0 ) -- a fixture of the presidential race has been @entity4 's 47 % problem : those @entity5 who do n't pay federal income tax that @entity4 has described as freeloaders . of course , @entity4 has retracted his remark . but if he still wants to attack those who freeload off of @entity5 taxpayers , there is a better target : our wealthy overseas allies . forty - seven percent is also roughly the @entity5 share of global military spending . our annual $ 700 billion - plus military budget exceeds the next 10 biggest military budgets combined . much of that money buys forces needed to defend allies against threats they could afford to meet themselves . alliances that once served the @entity5 national interest have become a subsidy to rich allies . in a recent foreign policy speech , @entity4 noted that only three of the 28 @entity32 allies meet their commitment to spend 2 % of their gdp on defense . he promises to fix that by asking our allies to honor their commitment to security spending . but the @entity41 have grown adept at keeping a straight face while ignoring such lectures . if @entity4 wants them to do more , he should suggest giving them less -- a logic he appreciates in domestic contexts . the same would apply to the @entity48 , @entity49 and various others we defend . some allies , especially in @entity53 , might increase military spending . others , noting less danger and bulging debts , may not . @entity58 is not the best judge of others ' needs . but with fewer commitments , we can maintain fewer forces and lower future military costs , which means more savings for @entity5 taxpayers . as long as the @entity5 bears the lion 's share of global defenses , our allies have little incentive to do more . as we saw in @entity73 in 2011 , the @entity72 enabled @entity32 's intervention by providing air refueling , intelligence and precision strike capability . our combat - tested @entity78 and @entity79 are the envy of their counterparts around the world , many of whom they train . our special operations forces track terrorists everywhere . @entity4 complains that our @entity88 has fewer ships than before @entity90 but fails to mention that it is far bigger than any other fleet and is the police force of the global seas . @entity4 has insisted that @entity5 exceptionalism compels us to steady alliances , settle regional disputes and forcefully promote democracy everywhere . but he has reversed the idea of @entity5 exceptionalism . early @entity5 leaders thought that the nation 's virtue lay in liberal values and the example @entity5 sets . for them , @entity5 exceptionalism had nothing to do with military adventurism . permanent allies might drag us into others ' disputes , imperiling liberalism by centralizing power in the presidency and requiring a massive military establishment . similar worries encouraged president @entity116 's push to keep our commitments to allies temporary . in 1953 , @entity119 and @entity48 were still recovering from @entity120 and @entity49 , with our help , was still fighting the @entity122 and its @entity124 allies . @entity5 commitments to defend those nations came from fear that the @entity128 would capitalize on their weakness , through conquest or internal intrigue , and gather enough strength to threaten us directly . those allies long ago grew rich enough to defend themselves , and the @entity128 has been history for decades . the @entity138 collectively has a population and economy larger than ours . but while @entity5 spend about $ 2,700 per capita annually on the military , @entity32 allies average around $ 500 . more than 20 years after the end of the @entity145 , @entity41 sit in cafes while over 80,000 @entity5 service personnel still help guard @entity119 against @entity149 , which now has a gdp around the size of @entity152 and @entity153 combined . sixty years after the end of @entity156 , nearly 30,000 @entity5 forces still shield the @entity49 against a @entity158 neighbor with a 25th of its wealth and half its population . we have almost 50,000 troops in @entity48 almost 70 years after its surrender . @entity48 spends only about 1 % of its gdp on its military , provides no troops to help stabilize @entity168 , but insists that @entity5 @entity79 defend their every rocky island in a possible dispute with @entity124 . @entity4 still has time to change his mind on this issue . rather than lecturing our allies about their responsibilities , we should kick them off the dole , rescinding commitments to their defense and removing troops from their shores . this is a problem that any president faces , including president @entity184 . but @entity4 may make the problem worse through his proposed increase in military spending . if that seems chintzy , remember that there is virtue in economy and that we have needier causes at home , starting with the deficit . that tack might also prove politically useful : polls show that @entity5 would prefer to do less for rich allies . and foreign freeloaders ca n't vote . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 and @entity201 .	@entity116:Eisenhower	@entity158:Northern	@entity138:European Union	@entity153:Portugal	@entity152:Spain	@entity201:Friedman	@entity119:Europe	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:U.S.	@entity4:Mitt Romney	@entity156:Korean War	@entity53:Asia	@entity88:Navy	@entity79:Marines	@entity78:Army	@entity58:Washington	@entity73:Libya	@entity72:U.S. Air Force	@entity32:NATO	@entity128:Soviet Union	@entity124:China	@entity200:Sapolsky	@entity122:North	@entity120:World War II	@entity90:World War I	@entity145:Cold War	@entity168:Afghanistan	@entity184:Obama	@entity149:Russia	@entity41:Europeans	@entity48:Japan	@entity49:South
the 29 - year - old is reigning @entity12 , world and @placeholder champion	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's dressage dominance was recognized wednesday evening in her native @entity3 as " the girl with the @entity5 " was named the @entity7 & @entity6 . @entity2 , who earned her nickname back home after her heroics at @entity11 , enjoyed a 2014 to remember as the @entity12 and @entity14 champion became a world champion to consolidate her place at the summit of the sport . the 29 - year - old -- riding @entity20 gelding @entity22 -- claimed two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events , as well as a team silver , at the @entity26 in @entity27 earlier this year , while she also became the first ever @entity28 to win the @entity30 dressage title in @entity31 in april . the achievements of @entity2 -- she is the first rider in history to hold all the major titles in dressage -- are all the more remarkable given that she only began competing on the tour three years ago . " if someone had asked me ' do you think that 's possible ? ' i would have been like ' absolutely not , ' " @entity2 told @entity0 in september after achieving the " grand slam . " " for it to have been possible and that i 've actually done it is very surreal and something that i always have to think ' oh my @entity44 ! ' i 've won all of it . there 's no more i can do . " @entity2 first became a @entity14 champion back in 2011 , winning team gold in @entity50 , before following that up two years later in @entity51 with two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events . sandwiched in between those triumphs came her team and individual @entity12 gold medals in @entity56 -- the moment when she really first caught the @entity3 public 's imagination . " i remember going into the local supermarket and i got spotted by a guy going ' @entity62 you 're the girl with the dancing horse ! ' he goes , ' i know nothing about horses but i watched you on the telly , ' " @entity2 recalls . " if you say you do dressage and the dancing horses ... nine times out of 10 people recognize our sport now . " none of the fame and success would have been possible without @entity22 , though , according to @entity2 , who has been with her every step of the way . " he 's not just a horse to me , he truly is my best friend . one day i want him to pull my car when i get married , " @entity2 says . " that 's what i want do with him . he 'll be strong enough to do that . " @entity2 saw off strong competition in winning the accolade , with @entity12 skeleton gold medalist @entity91 taking second place and athlete @entity93 , who won @entity14 gold in the 10,000 meters at the age of 40 , coming third . gymnast @entity96 won the young sportswoman award following her four golds at the @entity99 in @entity100 .	@entity22:Valegro	@entity20:Dutch	@entity26:World Equestrian Games	@entity27:Normandy	@entity28:Briton	@entity3:British	@entity2:Dujardin	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Sunday Times	@entity6:Sky Sports Sportswoman of the Year	@entity5:Dancing Horse	@entity51:Herning	@entity50:Rotterdam	@entity56:London	@entity31:Lyon	@entity30:World Cup	@entity14:European	@entity12:Olympic	@entity11:London 2012	@entity100:Glasgow	@entity103:Sportswoman of the Year	@entity99:Commonwealth Games	@entity96:Claudia Fragapane	@entity93:Jo Pavey	@entity91:Lizzy Yarnold	@entity44:God	@entity62:Oh my God
hopes to become a major education technology provider in @placeholder	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- fresh faced and full of energy , five recent graduates sit around the conference room table . they all hail from a different @entity5 country , and they all have big dreams about revamping education in their continent for a digital era . these are the headquarters of @entity13 in @entity14 , an online training platform that 's been partnering with universities in @entity5 to provide short e-courses for users . helped by a single private investor , the tech education portal is looking to harness a growing demand for online learning by allowing students to log into classes remotely . " at @entity13 , we develop learning management systems and provide content development services to higher institutions to take their courses online so that the general public can access them at a cheaper price , " says @entity26 - born @entity25 , one of @entity13 's founders . the flexibility that comes with e-learning is just one of the many reasons @entity25 says the online education tool has found success . " it 's responsive to the students ' schedules , " says the 22 - year - old entrepreneur . " but also managers who want to do courses but are too busy to do them can now use [ @entity13 ] and sign in when they get back from work and access the resources online . " @entity25 came up with the concept for @entity13 -- which means " to learn " in @entity49 -- at university when he found he could n't take school home . he had hoped to start the company in his homeland of @entity26 , but the obstacles were too great . " it was very difficult because they were not digitally ready , " he recalls . " they did not understand what i was trying to do . the second problem i faced was internet penetration in the country . i thought @entity5 was more stable so @entity63 had a higher chance of success there because many people already have the @entity68 . " alongside four other young entrepreneurs -- @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 ( @entity5 ) and @entity76 ( @entity77 ) -- the e-learning portal took shape and each founder provided a different perspective for the startup . none are over the age of 25 , yet these innovators are simply doing what is natural to the millennial generation -- using technology to find solutions to problems they 've experienced . " we bring together the problems we 've seen in different parts of @entity5 and we are all trying to create together solutions to the problems we have experienced in different parts of the continent , " says @entity25 . he adds : " i was aware of user experience because user experience of technology in @entity26 was not very good . one of the other partners was keen on developing the mobile application because he said in his area of the world , there are more mobile users . so we are bringing together solutions made by the problems we 've faced in @entity5 . " @entity25 explains that @entity13 offers a free mobile app that can be downloaded to a user 's smartphone . students can access the e-learning portal via a keycode provided by the university they are registered to . " at the moment , [ mobile ] is very limited . mobile phones are good for getting your results , educators checking attendance reports and all that stuff . but the real core experience is from the desktop machine . " since its launch in 2009 , @entity13 has been recognized by several international bodies , including the @entity127 and the @entity128 . it has also received a number of accolades , including the " @entity135 " award at the @entity134 's @entity133 in 2012 and @entity137 's " @entity136 " prize . looking ahead , @entity25 has big plans for the startup . " our major goal is to be a major education technology provider in @entity5 , " he says . " so we 're just trying to strategically position ourselves , so when @entity5 is ready we would also be ready . " for the time being however , the company 's main focus is creating sustainable growth before proceeding to roll out the platform across the continent . as for @entity25 , the passionate @entity26 says he is determined to keep on working to help increase accessibility to education in the continent . " the future of the continent lies in how educated people are , " he says . " all the major problems can be solved with education -- education is the key to the future .

@entity3 has 1,000 soldiers and advanced military equipment in @placeholder , a @entity2 officer says	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 still has about 1,000 troops inside eastern @entity5 , a @entity2 military officer said thursday , a week after @entity5 's government and @entity8 rebels agreed to a ceasefire aimed at ending months of conflict . @entity2 also sees 20,000 more @entity3 troops aligned along the border , the @entity2 officer told @entity0 . he was not named according to standard practice in the organization . @entity2 believes that these numbers amount to a large and effective military force , the officer said . in addition to the troop numbers , @entity2 continues to see sophisticated @entity3 military equipment in @entity5 . @entity2 remains concerned and urges @entity3 to engage with the international community and @entity5 to find a political solution to the crisis , the officer said . @entity24 has consistently denied allegations by @entity26 and the @entity27 that @entity3 has troops in @entity5 , and that it has armed and supported the rebels . on wednesday , @entity5 president @entity30 said some 70 % of the @entity3 troops believed to have been in @entity5 had withdrawn back across the border , according to the national news agency @entity33 . information released by @entity5 's @entity36 on thursday indicated that the rebel forces control a strip of eastern @entity5 running from the city of @entity40 down to the @entity41 . ' very fragile ' ceasefire the truce was signed friday after talks in @entity45 , @entity46 , between representatives of @entity5 , the rebels and @entity3 . but more substantive talks on issues , including the decentralization of power and constitutional reform in @entity5 , must still take place before a lasting resolution can be found . @entity3 @entity57 spokesman @entity56 told a briefing thursday that the ceasefire was " very fragile " and that both sides must implement the framework agreed to in @entity45 . " there is mounting evidence of the @entity26 government strengthening its military groups in different areas , regions ; there are eyewitness reports to prove it , " he said , " though @entity5 authorities keep on reassuring us that they 're not planning a military operation . " @entity56 said @entity3 was also surprised by @entity2 's announcement of plans to hold joint military exercises with @entity26 in @entity5 later this year . " this might cause the escalation ( of the situation ) and put the progress in peaceful settlement of the crisis in @entity5 under threat , " he warned . new sanctions a new round of @entity89 sanctions against @entity3 over its actions in @entity5 will come into force friday , @entity86 president @entity85 said thursday . @entity89 officials will review the implementation of the ceasefire before the end of the month , he said , after which the sanctions could be amended or lifted . the sanctions include tougher restrictions on @entity3 's access to @entity89 capital markets ; a ban on loans by @entity89 companies or individuals to five major @entity3 state - owned banks ; a ban on debt financing to three major @entity3 defense companies and three major energy companies ; and an asset freeze and travel ban against 24 more individuals . this means 119 people in total are now subject to sanctions , while 23 entities remain under an asset freeze in the @entity89 . @entity3 has warned it will respond to any additional measures . in his remarks , @entity56 said the deadly crash in july of @entity123 -- which @entity26 and the @entity27 believe was shot down from rebel - held territory using a @entity3 - made missile launcher -- was being used to justify the imposition of broad @entity129 sanctions against @entity3 . a preliminary report into the crash released this week by @entity132 investigators did not apportion blame for the crash but said the plane was brought down by " high - energy objects " from outside . the @entity137 will join the @entity89 in implementing additional sanctions against @entity3 over its " illegal actions in @entity5 , " president @entity136 said thursday . " we will deepen and broaden sanctions in @entity3 's financial , energy , and defense sectors , " he said . the administration will outline the specifics of the sanctions friday . " we are implementing these new measures in light of @entity3 's actions to further destabilize @entity5 over the last month , including through the presence of heavily armed @entity3 forces in eastern @entity5 . we are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in @entity45 , but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that @entity3 has ceased its efforts to destabilize @entity5 , " @entity136 said . aid convoy @entity56 also said there had not yet been a " breakthrough " allowing a new @entity3 aid convoy to start moving into @entity5 in the next few days . " we hope that the delivery will be carried out with participation of @entity5 's border guards and customs officers as well as officials from the @entity168 , " he said .

@placeholder stays out of trouble in 21st and final stage	@entity17	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 became only the sixth man in history to win all three of cycling 's major tours as he sealed victory in this year 's @entity7 on the @entity8 sunday . @entity1 stayed out of trouble on the 137.5km stage from @entity11 , which was won by @entity13 sprinter @entity12 of the @entity15 team . it left the 29 - year - old @entity17 a commanding seven minutes 52 seconds ahead of runner - up @entity18 with another @entity20 , @entity21 , in third . @entity22 's @entity1 joins illustrious company by adding to his earlier triumphs in the @entity25 and @entity26 . legends @entity27 of @entity29 , @entity20 duo @entity30 and @entity31 , @entity1 's fellow @entity17 @entity32 and @entity33 of @entity34 are the only others to achieve the feat. @entity33 was one of the favorites for this year 's race , but crashed out , as did reigning champion @entity39 of @entity40 . it left the way clear for @entity1 , who served notice of his intentions with an audacious break to win the second stage in @entity47 in @entity48 and gained more time on the cobbled fifth stage where @entity39 exited . @entity1 continued to dominate as the race went over the @entity51 and @entity52 , winning three more stages to be a deserved winner after three grueling weeks . crossing the line with his teammates , he went straight to his wife and baby daughter to celebrate with his family . " it 's the most important and the best moment , i never imagined it could feel this good because when you find yourself on this podium on the @entity8 , it 's unique , " said @entity1 . " now that i 'm here it 's even better than i imagined . i fought for this every day , i started building from a long way out with a winter preparation with the team because we had decided this was our objective . " @entity12 , the star of the early stages of the @entity26 , used his raw sprinting power to match @entity1 's four wins this year , edging out @entity79 's @entity78 with @entity80 of @entity82 third . @entity83 of @entity84 finished ninth , but had already wrapped up the green jersey for points leader despite failing to win a stage on the @entity88 . @entity12 hinted he would be targeting green himself in future races . " my goals wo n't change in the future , especially at the @entity7 , " he told the official @entity7 website . " i 'll go again for stage wins but i 'm not a man of records . i 've said in the past and i repeat that the green jersey can become an option in the future . " the 24 - year - old @entity21 , one of the great hopes of @entity20 cycling , took the white jersey for best young rider , with @entity105 of @entity106 winning the @entity107 .	@entity22:Astana	@entity17:Italian	@entity20:French	@entity21:Pinot	@entity26:Tour	@entity27:Eddy Merckx	@entity25:Giro d'Italia	@entity29:Belgium	@entity15:Giant-Shimano	@entity80:Ramunas Navardauskas	@entity82:Lithuania	@entity83:Peter Sagan	@entity84:Slovakia	@entity88:2014 Tour	@entity118:Grand Tours	@entity1:Vincenzo Nibali	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Tour de France	@entity8:Champs Elysees	@entity52:Pyrenees	@entity51:Alps	@entity79:Norway	@entity78:Alexander Kristoff	@entity31:Bernard Hinault	@entity30:Jacques Anquetil	@entity33:Contador	@entity32:Felipe Gimondi	@entity13:Germany	@entity34:Spain	@entity11:Evry	@entity39:Froome	@entity18:Jean Christophe-Peraud	@entity105:Rafal Majka	@entity106:Poland	@entity107:King of the Mountains classification	@entity109:Paris	@entity117:Nibali	@entity47:Sheffield	@entity40:Britain	@entity12:Marcel Kittel	@entity48:England
child who got divorce in @placeholder struggling to be a child again	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- it is midday and girls are flooding out of school . @entity6 is not among them . @entity6 today is angry and skips school but is still relieved her defiance paid off . we find her at the family 's two - room house in an impoverished suburb of the @entity1 capital . @entity6 is angry , combative and yelling . tension surrounds the home like a noose . after much arguing with family members , @entity6 finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with @entity2 . her presence is grudging , although @entity2 got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring . @entity6 is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago . then , there was no doubt the 10 - year - old was very much a child , a portrait of innocence . she had a shy smile , playful nature and a whimsical giggle . her retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting . watch @entity6 tell her story to @entity2 on @entity41 's @entity40 ¬ª the story was supposed to end with the divorce . there was , though , a stunning transformation . the young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph . her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world . in the fall of 2008 , @entity6 was recognized as @entity55 's @entity54 , alongside some of the world 's most impressive women . she even attended the ceremony in @entity60 and was applauded by women from @entity62 to @entity63 . there is a tell - all book , which is to be published in more than 20 languages , and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties . @entity6 's strength was celebrated by complete strangers . but what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform ? " there is no change at all since going on television , " @entity6 says bitterly . " i hoped there was someone to help us , but we did n't find anyone . it has n't changed a thing . they said they were going to help me and no one has helped me . i wish i had never spoken to the media . " @entity6 says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off . there was never going to be a fortune . generous people have donated thousands so @entity6 could go to a private school , but she refuses to attend , according to @entity96 , the human rights lawyer who took on the child 's divorce case . " i know @entity6 was absent from the school . i spoke with her father and her family . and i ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school . but they said , ' you know we do n't have the money for the transportation . do n't have the money for the food , ' " says @entity96 . she believes @entity6 is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune . @entity6 's parents say they 've received nothing , and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way . " i was happy i got divorced but i 'm sad about the way it turned out after i went on television , " she said , adding that she feels like an outcast even among family and friends . @entity6 was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly . and yet , as a wife , she was spared nothing . " i did n't want to sleep with him but he forced me to , he hit me , insulted me , " she said . she described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture . @entity6 described how she was beaten and raped and how , after just a few weeks of marriage , she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement . but her parents told her they could not protect her , that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate . @entity2 tried to get comment from the girl 's ex-husband and family , but they declined . @entity6 's parents , like many others in @entity1 , struck a social bargain . more than half of all young @entity1 girls are married off before the age of 18 , many times to older men , some with more than one wife . marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents . but @entity6 's parents say they did not expect the girl 's new husband to demand sex from his child bride . to escape , @entity6 hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge . after several hours , a judge finally went to see her . " and he asked me , ' what do you want ' and i said ' i want a divorce ' and he said ' you 're married ? ' and i said ' yes . ' " says @entity6 . @entity6 's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing , and the girl was put in the care of @entity96 . it seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce . but based on the principles of @entity191 law , her husband was compensated , not prosecuted . @entity6 was ordered to pay him more than $ 200 -- a huge amount in a country where the @entity194 says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $ 1 a day . @entity196 is working to help the girl get her life back . now a @entity1 diplomat , she too was a child bride 30 years ago . but when she left her husband , she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts @entity6 . she said : " it 's good to talk about @entity6 and to have her story come out , but the problem is it 's too much pressure on her . " she does n't understand what 's going on . she 's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now . if we really love @entity6 then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life , because education is the most important thing for her . " to get her divorce , @entity6 showed character and strength not easily expressed by women in @entity1 , let alone a 10 - year - old child bride . but she will need to muster all that strength and more if she 's to finally reclaim her life . @entity6 told us she thought the divorce would be the end of her struggle . but she 's angry that it turned out to be just the beginning . @entity2 producer @entity223 contributed to this report	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Yemen	@entity0:SANA'A	@entity6:Nujood Ali	@entity196:Khadije Al Salame	@entity194:United Nations Development Programme	@entity223:Schams Elwazer	@entity191:Shariah	@entity63:Nicole Kidman	@entity40:Untold Stories	@entity41:World	@entity55:Glamour Magazine	@entity240:Ali	@entity96:Nasser	@entity62:Hillary Clinton	@entity54:Woman of the Year	@entity60:New York
the rusting ship has docked at the @entity9 port of @placeholder	@entity10	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the crippled @entity3 cruise ship reached the end of its final voyage . refloated by salvage crews earlier this month , the rusting hulk docked at @entity7 in the @entity9 city of @entity10 early sunday . the cruise ship , which ran aground in january 2012 off @entity12 with more than 4,200 passengers aboard , was eased into a dry dock at the port for salvage . it managed to make the four - day journey in a convoy of vessels from @entity12 to @entity10 without major incident , despite one night of storms . according to civil protection chief @entity24 , strong winds hampered the delicate maneuvering needed to get the ship into the dry dock . one person still missing the ship will be searched for the remains of @entity31 , a 33 - year - old waiter who is the only victim still missing in the tragedy . a total of 32 people were killed in the disaster . searches for @entity31 are also underway in @entity12 at the site where the ship had rested for the past 30 months . ' we 'll die without that boat ' " hopefully this will be the start of closure for the family , " salvage master @entity41 said from on board the @entity3 . " i hope they find @entity31 . " environmental concerns prompted the decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the @entity3 rather than taking it apart in the pristine @entity52 waters where it ran aground . it 's the largest salvage operation ever attempted , and the most expensive , at a cost of $ 1.5 billion so far . dismantling to take 2 years the lengthy process of dismantling the wrecked ship is expected to take two years . how the ship was righted the first items to be removed will be passengers ' luggage and personal effects that are still stuck on board . more than 80 % of the @entity3 will be recycled or reused , including copper wiring , plumbing pipes , kitchens and some of the plastic room fittings that can be repaired . the remaining 50,000 tons of steel will be melted down and sold at the market price to be used to make construction girders , cars and even other ships . since the wreck in early 2012 , 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture , dishes , food , personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed . @entity81 reported from @entity0 and @entity82 wrote from @entity83 .	@entity3:Concordia	@entity31:Russel	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Rome	@entity7:Voltri port	@entity12:Giglio	@entity24:Franco Gabrielli	@entity10:Genoa	@entity9:Italian	@entity52:Mediterranean	@entity82:Jethro Mullen	@entity83:Hong Kong	@entity41:Nick Sloane	@entity81:Barbie Latza Nadeau

more than 2,700 @entity81 troops have died during the war , according to a @placeholder count	@entity2	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the @entity4 - led war in @entity1 marked its 10th year friday having passed two major milestones : the @entity6 has been forced out of power and @entity8 is dead . but there was little observance by @entity4 troops in @entity1 , where a month earlier many participated in commemorations to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . " we really celebrated the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , and we were out here in @entity1 , " marine corps maj. gen. @entity16 , commanding general of @entity18 troops in southern @entity1 , told reporters during a briefing on thursday . " i think that to us it was a far more significant date than 10 years of fighting in @entity1 because , really , when you look at the 10 years , you 're looking at different levels of forces , different levels of attention given to @entity1 . " the @entity4 - led war in @entity1 began october 7 , 2011 , with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion . president @entity31 has called it " the longest - running war in the nation 's history " . the aim was to oust the @entity6 and dismantle @entity38 's leadership , though the leaders of both groups -- @entity41 and @entity8 -- managed to escape capture . @entity8 was killed in may during a raid by @entity4 commandos on his hideout in @entity46 , @entity47 . the whereabouts of @entity41 is unknown , and he has not been seen in public in years . as the @entity4 turned its attention toward @entity52 , insurgent violence in @entity1 flared against @entity1 civilians and security forces as well as the @entity4 and its coalition partners . more than 2,700 troops from the @entity4 and its partners have died during the 10 years of war , according to a @entity2 count . of those , 1,780 were @entity4 , 382 were @entity61 and 157 were @entity62 . since the conflict began , the number of casualties has risen by the year , with a significant jump from 2008 to 2009 . at least 296 coalition troops died in 2008 . it nearly doubled in 2009 when 517 coalition troops were killed . that year , president @entity31 authorized a surge of 33,000 @entity4 forces to @entity1 to combat the violence . two years later , the @entity4 outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from @entity1 , beginning with pulling the 33,000 surge troops by the end of 2012 and the remaining 68,000 by the end of 2014 . the move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the @entity81 nations . on thursday , defense ministers from the 49 nations that make up the @entity18 pledged their support to @entity1 even as they make plans to withdraw troops by 2014 . " let there be no mistake : transition is not departure . we will not take our leave when the @entity1 take the lead , " @entity81 secretary general @entity91 told reporters thursday in @entity93 , @entity94 . the ministers are scheduled to meet again in may in @entity99 where @entity91 said they will " need to decide what more we will do . " while @entity81 has insisted that the transition of security for the country to @entity1 forces is conditions - based rather than calendar - driven , the clock is ticking on the withdrawal deadline . the planned withdrawal has raised a number of questions about the stability of @entity1 , which has been hit by a wave of high - profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations . last month 's turban bomb assassination of former @entity1 president @entity118 , revered by many as a father of the @entity122 movement that ousted the @entity123 in the 1980s , appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process . @entity118 was the chairman of president @entity127 's @entity126 , which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the @entity6 -- a strategy that @entity127 publicly abandoned following @entity118 's killing . the war in @entity1 , once viewed by a majority of @entity4 as a must , has become widely unpopular as concerns have shifted to the economy and job losses . in a new @entity140 report on war and sacrifice released this week , half of post- 9/11 veterans said the @entity1 war has been worth fighting . only 44 % felt that way about @entity52 , and one - third said both wars were worth the costs . @entity149 is among those veterans who question the war . @entity149 , who was a freshman in college and a @entity154 student on september 11 , 2001 , said he remembers thinking that the war in @entity1 would be over before he joined the @entity155 . but as the war continued , @entity149 said he began to have mixed feelings . " i joined to defend the country , and i feel that a lot of the things we were doing were not exactly that , " he said in a @entity163 . " in my opinion , it basically should have been limited to what we initially were going in to do : @entity168 and the architects of the attacks . " @entity149 said it is very difficult to look back objectively on the experience . " you lost friends and made sacrifices . you do n't want to ever think that everything that happened was in vain , " he said . but @entity179 has a different perspective on the war , which he says gave his family back their home and their livelihoods . he was 13 when he and his family fled their home in @entity1 's @entity188 amid a civil war that would see the @entity6 take control of the country . driven out by bombardments and fighting , his family crossed into @entity47 , making their home in @entity195 . @entity179 , 28 , said " everything changed " after the @entity6 were forced from power . @entity179 , who worked for a @entity4 business for two years upon his return to @entity1 , founded media startup @entity201 last year . " ( @entity203 ) veryone can have a job and go to school ( now ) , and i can have my business , " he said in a @entity163 .	@entity81:NATO	@entity155:Army	@entity154:ROTC	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Afghanistan	@entity0:Kabul	@entity6:Taliban	@entity4:U.S.	@entity179:Kohistani	@entity93:Brussels	@entity195:Islamabad	@entity8:Bin Laden	@entity52:Iraq	@entity118:Rabbani	@entity31:Barack Obama	@entity16:John Toolan Jr.	@entity38:al Qaeda	@entity18:International Security Assistance Force	@entity99:Chicago	@entity126:High Council for Peace	@entity127:Karzai	@entity201:Afghan123.com	@entity94:Belgium	@entity122:Mujahideen	@entity123:Soviets	@entity91:Rasmussen	@entity188:Kapisa province	@entity163:CNN iReport	@entity140:Pew Research Center	@entity168:Hunt down bin Laden	@entity149:Messel	@entity46:Abbottabad	@entity47:Pakistan	@entity203:E	@entity41:Mullah Omar	@entity62:Canadian	@entity61:British
new : roadside bomb kills 3 @placeholder soldiers and an interpreter in @entity18 province	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- two bombings in separate @entity1 provinces on monday killed eight @entity4 troops , the @entity4 military said . a boy with a machine gun weeps monday at the site of a suicide bombing in @entity12 that killed a sheik . a roadside bomb killed three @entity4 soldiers and an interpreter in @entity18 province , which has been a major front in the war during the " surge " of @entity4 troops fighting insurgents near the capital . earlier in the day , at least five @entity4 soldiers on foot patrol were killed and three others wounded in a suicide bombing in @entity0 . in addition , suicide bombers killed five @entity1 in two bombings in @entity18 province monday morning , including a sheik who helped battle @entity33 extremists and his 5 - year - old niece . watch new suicide tactics in @entity1 ¬ª four @entity4 soldiers died at the scene monday 's @entity0 blast and one more died later of wounds , the military said . they were with @entity42 . an @entity1 interpreter also was wounded in the explosion , the officials said . initial reports indicate the bomber was wearing an explosive vest . " five soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the @entity1 and @entity4 people . i ask you remember these fallen heroes and their families as well as their wounded brethren in your thoughts and prayers , " said col. @entity52 , chief of staff for @entity42 . " we remain resolute in our resolve to protect the people of @entity1 and kill or capture those who would bring them harm . " the explosion marks the deadliest attack against the @entity4 military since five soldiers were killed january 28 in a roadside bombing in @entity68 . troops killed a @entity71 insurgent whose network was responsible for that attack . earlier , an @entity75 official said one person was killed and eight people were wounded in a suicide bomb attack targeting a @entity4 military convoy in western @entity0 . it is not clear if the @entity4 and @entity1 reports are about the same incident . monday 's attacks would bring the number of @entity4 troops killed in @entity1 this month to 10 . a total of 3,983 military personnel have died in the nearly 5 - year - old war . the attack came after a bomber near @entity91 targeted the leader of a security group assisting @entity4 troops . the teen suicide bomber killed a sheik and a 5 - year - old , a day after she went to the sheik 's @entity12 home claiming to need help finding her husband , police and family members said . the female suicide bomber , 18 , blew herself up at the sheik 's home monday morning , police said . the tribal leader was the head of a local citizens group that has been working with @entity4 forces to rout out insurgents . the largely @entity33 security groups are known as @entity113 . @entity114 is east of @entity91 , situated in the volatile @entity18 province , which has been a major front for the " surge " of @entity4 - led troops targeting militants near @entity0 . according to one of the sheik 's cousins , the teen bomber went to the sheik 's house sunday to ask him for help finding her husband -- thought to be kidnapped or detained . the 18 - year - old was told to return monday , the cousin said . she returned monday and staged the attack , killing the sheik , his 5 - year - old niece and one of his security guards , police said . the attack reflects both the growing use of females as suicide bombers in @entity1 and the targeting of @entity113 , which are also known as @entity141 or @entity142 . the grass - roots groups , which are sometimes led by former insurgents , have drawn more than 90,000 volunteers to their ranks , military spokesman rear adm. @entity143 said sunday . since november , there have been at least five attacks carried out by female suicide bombers , including a twin bombing at @entity0 pet markets last month that killed almost 100 people . insurgent groups , particularly @entity155 in @entity1 , are increasingly using women as suicide bombers because they are less likely to be searched , the @entity4 military has said . about an hour after the attack at the sheik 's home , another suicide bomber approached @entity1 security forces in @entity163 and blew himself up as the forces began shooting at him . the blast killed two civilians and wounded 20 others , including two police officers , authorities said . @entity163 also is in @entity18 . in other developments : a suicide car bomb exploded monday outside an upscale hotel in @entity174 , killing two people and wounding at least 32 others , police said . the blast occurred at the @entity179 hotel , located in the center of the city . it is in northern @entity1 's @entity184 region and is a common stop for visiting government officials , businessmen and contractors . two bombings in @entity0 on monday killed an @entity1 and wounded nine others , an @entity190 official said . a parked car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in @entity195 , a @entity196 neighborhood in northeastern @entity0 , killing a civilian and wounding seven others . a roadside bomb exploded on a highway near a @entity4 military patrol in eastern @entity0 , wounding two bystanders . coalition troops north of @entity0 killed five insurgents and detained 19 people in raids , the @entity4 military said monday . the sunday raids were part of coalition forces ' " untiring efforts to remove @entity155 from @entity1 , " said lt. col. @entity212 , a @entity214 spokeswoman . several @entity4 troops may have been sickened by dirty water intended for hygiene use and supplied to bases around @entity1 between 2004 and 2006 , according to a @entity220 report released monday . however , the @entity220 inspector general 's report points out that because the water was not monitored , it is impossible to tell for sure if it was dirty and if it contributed to the troops getting sick . e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .	@entity42:Multi-National Division-Baghdad	@entity114:Kanan	@entity113:Awakening Councils	@entity155:al Qaeda	@entity214:Multi-National Forces-Iraq	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Iraqi	@entity0:Baghdad	@entity174:Sulaimaniya	@entity212:Maura Gillen	@entity4:U.S.	@entity179:Sulaimani Palace	@entity196:Shiite	@entity195:Shaab	@entity190:Interior Ministry	@entity52:Allen Batschelet	@entity75:Iraqi Interior Ministry	@entity71:Saudi	@entity232:Jonathan Wald	@entity33:Sunni	@entity12:Kanan	@entity163:Muqdadiya	@entity230:Jamie McIntyre	@entity18:Diyala	@entity231:Mohammed Tawfeeq	@entity91:Baquba	@entity220:Department of Defense	@entity141:Concerned Citizens Groups	@entity142:Sons of Iraq	@entity143:Gregory	@entity184:Kurdish	@entity68:Mosul
one common culprit of @placeholder 's hurting feet is flip - flops	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- with a litany of stubbed toes , sprained ankles , broken bones and blistered feet , @entity2 ' feet are hurting . according to the @entity7 released in june , 78 % of adults 21 and older have experienced one or more foot problems in their lives . one common culprit of @entity2 's foot pain , especially during the summer , is the flip - flop . whether it be on the beach , at the grocery store or even in the office , people love to free their feet . but flat sandals are nothing but bad news , says @entity23 , executive director for the @entity24 , who does n't own a single pair . " there 's no heel support and structural support ... on that little slab of rubber . " flip - flops have been around since at least 1500 b.c. they have been the choice of footwear for everyone from ancient @entity37 to @entity39 beach bums to @entity42 's women 's lacrosse team during a 2005 visit to the @entity44 . providing wearers with ease and emancipation , flip - flops are hard not to love , said @entity49 , president and co-founder of @entity51 . " it promotes this good mental state of health , " he said . " it 's hard to be in a bad mood when you 're wearing flip - flops . " despite the shoe 's popularity , @entity23 said there are many risks involved with wearing flip - flops . flip - flops are n't always easy on the feet although feet were designed to walk barefoot on @entity68 's natural surfaces ( grass , sand or gravel ) , they were not prepared to endure the concrete , asphalt and steel that covers so many landscapes today , @entity23 said . these unmovable surfaces are harsh on bare feet , and the thin rubber sole of many flip - flops does little to adequately absorb the shock they produce . whether you are standing still or in motion , your feet are your first point of contact with the ground . the way your feet are positioned provides the foundation for the body 's skeletal alignment . a flat shoe provides little arch or lateral support and even slight shifts in stance over time could lead to misalignment , causing pain in the knees , hips and back . " everything in your body starts with how you strike your heel to the ground , " @entity23 said . with nothing to keep a wearer 's foot in place , flip - flops can also lead to tumbles , twisted ankles and even broken bones . " you 're taking your five toes and grabbing your shoe to make sure it does n't slide out , " @entity23 said . " that action of the toes grabbing the shoe on the toe box is not normal . " shoes should flex where your foot bends , said @entity122 , a podiatrist at @entity123 at the @entity124 in @entity125 . but the rubber soles of most flip - flops just bend all over the place , while the stiff soles of some stylish varieties may not bend at all , she said . flip - flops ' straps can also rub as a wearer walks , creating friction that leads to blisters . and because the lightweight sandals offer virtually no protection , it 's more common for wearers ' feet to get cuts , scrapes and bruises . " a little layer of rubber -- it will protect you from a stone or a glass , but a nail could puncture that , " @entity23 said . @entity122 said wearing flip - flops can be seriously detrimental for people whose feet are already at risk : for people with diabetes , who often have poor circulation and feeling in their feet , wearing flip - flops can expose them not only to injury but to infection . those with balance issues may find it hard to feel secure when wearing rubbery flip - flops . and for those suffering from obesity , sporting the unstructured shoe can add strain to feet that are already stressed with carrying extra weight . the real problem is that people are wearing flip - flops while doing everything from skateboarding to gardening to running errands , @entity122 said . " it 's not that they wear them , " @entity122 said . " they overwear them . " but @entity49 said researchers , who typically refer in their studies to cheap rubber flip - flops that can be purchased at discount stores , must realize not all flip - flops are created equally . " they seem to miss that whole other part of the industry that is creating really good footwear with innovation and technology , " he said . @entity49 said oftentimes it 's such sandals that alleviate problems , not cause them . " i know a lot of people , both customers of our shop , friends and family , and people in the industry that wear flip - flops because they have problems , " he said . " it 's more comfortable , easier to put on and off , and there 's breathability . " rather than buying a $ 2 pair of rubber flip - flops at the drugstore , @entity49 suggests spending the extra money on a pair with deep heel cups , high arch support and comfortable toe support , such as those from @entity220 and @entity221 . @entity122 agrees that there times when wearing flip - flops can be beneficial . in the health club locker room or at the community pool , flip - flops can protect feet against fungi and wart - causing viruses that can be acquired by walking around barefoot . the simple sandals can also shield feet against the beach 's hot sand , which might otherwise cause skin to burn and blister on your walk to the water . but flip - flop use should be limited , experts say . @entity122 's go - to shoe for everyday wear is a pair of tennis shoes . " the number one best shoe for everybody is a good athletic shoe √¢ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äù something that laces up and has good structure to it , " @entity122 said . @entity23 said people should always wear padded , acrylic - blend socks , which wick moisture away from the foot , under properly fitted shoes that have plenty of toe room and support . @entity261 , which have some structure , cushion and breathability , can be an easy alternative to flip - flops , while sandals with a substantial foot bed and softer and broader straps are also a better option , @entity122 said . for people who insist on indulging in flip - flops ' cool convenience , @entity23 's asks them to avoid uneven surfaces and wash feet thoroughly after the sandals come off . " i tell people i 'm not going to change your lifestyle ; i just want you to know what the concerns are , " he said .	@entity221:Reef	@entity2:America	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:National Foot Health Assessment 2012	@entity24:Institute for Preventive Foot Health	@entity37:Egyptians	@entity23:Thompson	@entity39:California	@entity122:Oswell	@entity49:Curin	@entity44:White House	@entity42:Northwestern University	@entity51:Flip Flop Shops	@entity68:Earth	@entity124:Cedars-Sinai Medical Towers	@entity125:Los Angeles	@entity261:Crocs	@entity123:The Foot Center	@entity220:OluKai
@entity2 also is @placeholder 's @entity24	@entity184	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a year ago , president @entity2 was under fire . today , he is being feted . in just 12 months , the 51 - year - old lawyer and former @entity6 senator raised by a single mother went from a beleaguered candidate for re-election -- his record and signature health care law under daily attack by @entity15 rivals -- to being the first @entity16 to win more than 50 % of a presidential vote twice since @entity18 . now the nation 's first @entity20 - @entity6 president is @entity1 's @entity22 of 2012 , as voted on by readers of @entity1 , five days after being named @entity24 . second most intriguing : @entity25 : the girl the @entity27 wanted dead explaining @entity30 's choice , executive editor @entity28 cited @entity2 " for finding and forging a new majority , for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking , amid great adversity , to create a more perfect union . " @entity30 such accolades and results seemed improbable a year ago when @entity2 's approval rating hovered in the low 40s while unemployment was 8.5 % . history showed that it was rare , if not unprecedented , for an incumbent to win re-election with such figures . in december 2011 , @entity2 's signature health care reform law faced a @entity48 challenge and unrelenting criticism from @entity15 , especially conservatives who depicted it as a socialism - inspired government takeover of almost 20 % of the @entity6 economy . in addition , a fierce political battle with congressional @entity15 over taxes and spending dominated headlines that month . it was the latest in a series of fiscal showdowns that already caused an unprecedented downgrade in the @entity6 credit rating earlier in the year . despite ordering the mission that took out @entity66 in may 2011 and welcoming home the last combat troops from @entity69 seven months later , the president faced questions from some critics about his plan to end @entity74 combat operations in 2014 . @entity66 killing caps decade - long manhunt meanwhile , the upcoming election primary season focused attention on the @entity15 presidential race , spiced by frequent debates that gave candidates ample opportunity to tee off on @entity2 's record . his detractors labeled him a failure and said he was over his head , unable to understand the still sluggish economy recovering from recession , let alone how to strengthen it . a year later , @entity2 has parlayed his bad hand into a jackpot result . @entity2 takes key battlegrounds to win re-election the economy , which had just started to hint at consistent recovery toward the end of 2011 , continued to strengthen incrementally through 2012 , with the unemployment rate falling to 7.7 % in november . @entity97 : unemployment rate falls to lowest level since 2008 such steady , albeit slow growth provided cover for @entity2 against the @entity15 attack line that his push for stimulus spending in response to the recession he inherited amounted to wasted money and failed policy . while buffeted at times by @entity110 's deficit and currency woes , an overall perception of growing economic stability was a major reason @entity2 defeated @entity15 challenger @entity115 in november by more than 4 million votes . perhaps equally beneficial was the @entity48 's june ruling that the @entity118 did n't violate the @entity119 , ending a litany of legal challenges and giving the controversial measure an important public affirmation . while @entity115 campaigned on repealing the health care law if elected , the @entity48 decision strengthened @entity2 's ability to tout the benefits of the reforms to avoid the issue becoming an election liability . @entity48 on health care : how justices voted the president also made foreign policy a campaign strength over @entity115 , a former governor with little experience on international issues . @entity2 touted the @entity66 mission and how he kept his 2008 campaign pledge to end the @entity140 while also starting to wind down the @entity6 military role in @entity74 . during the final months of the election campaign , @entity2 also recovered the message and personal style that catapulted him to his historic victory four years earlier . shouting himself hoarse at times on the trail , he cast himself as the champion of equal opportunity and closing a widening wealth gap in the country . his campaign also benefited from key policy moves by the president . the administration halted deportations of some children of illegal immigrants , ensuring overwhelming support from the growing @entity162 - @entity6 community that proved vital on @entity163 . an earlier step to end the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that barred openly gay and lesbian people from military service as well his eventual support for same - sex marriage boosted his standing with younger @entity6 -- another key demographic . @entity2 announces he supports same - sex marriage as the end of his first term approached , @entity2 's approval rating topped 50 % , and polls showed the public consistently favoring his approach on deficit reduction over @entity15 positions . " this one 's more satisfying than ' 08 , " he told top aides on @entity163 , according to the @entity184 cover story on his being named @entity24 .

@entity6 spokeswoman says the alliance is not specifically targeting @placeholder	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 resolution justifies the targeting of @entity5 leader @entity4 , a senior @entity6 military official with operational knowledge of the @entity5 mission told @entity0 thursday . the resolution applies to @entity4 because , as head of the military , he is part of the control and command structure and therefore a legitimate target , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . the official was not authorized to talk to the media . asked by @entity0 whether @entity4 was being targeted , the @entity6 official declined to give a direct answer . but @entity6 spokeswoman @entity22 disputed the claim , saying the alliance was not specifically targeting @entity4 . " we are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians , including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks , " @entity22 said . " we are simply not targeting individuals , " she said , but noted on @entity0 's @entity32 that those military capabilities are the " nerve center of @entity4 's kill chain . the war machine that has been consistently attacking , relentlessly attacking and systematically attacking civilians in @entity5 . " " we 've seen just the other day in @entity37 that sort of indiscriminate shelling is still continuing . so the @entity4 regime still poses a threat to its own people . " @entity6 has been ramping up pressure on the regime , employing helicopters last weekend for the first time against @entity4 's forces . explosions are heard often in @entity48 , evidence of allied air strikes . @entity6 intervened in march in the months - long civil war under a @entity2 mandate to protect civilians as @entity4 tried to crush the revolt against him . the resolution adopted by the @entity56 authorized " all necessary measures , " with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . @entity6 's goal is to end attacks against civilians , the withdrawal of @entity4 forces to barracks and bases , and full humanitarian access , @entity22 said .

@entity223 : as alumnus of @placeholder , which is among the list , i feel grim satisfaction	@entity18	the @entity1 @entity0 announced recently that it is investigating 55 universities and colleges for their failure to properly handle sexual assault cases on campus . the list includes a number of prestigious institutions , including @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 , and my alma mater , @entity18 , where a 2008 university survey found that one in six women students had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact while enrolled . as a young alumnus , i feel a grim satisfaction at seeing my alma mater on the list . by the time i graduated , in 2009 , two of my close friends and one of my former roommates had been sexually assaulted during our four years on campus , and i had watched another friend go through the labyrinthine and largely ineffective student disciplinary process in an attempt to see her rapist held accountable . like so many other survivors of campus assault , she was discouraged from reporting to the police , and her case was instead handled internally , away from real law enforcement . this is , of course , part of the problem : if there 's no real punishment for sexual violence , assailants know they can get away with it , and survivors wo n't report it . and if survivors do n't report , universities can plead ignorance . when it came to sexual violence , it seemed that @entity18 's priorities were misplaced -- it was more interested in preserving the university 's reputation than ensuring the safety of the students . this is not to say that , within these institutions , there are not well - meaning individuals who work hard to keep students safe . but a few individuals can only do so much when they 're up against an institution whose primary goal seems to be to protect the university 's good name , even if that means providing cover for students who do terrible things . so far , @entity18 has not commented on the @entity0 's investigation . with so much at stake -- money , prestige and reputation -- on the line , it should not surprise us if @entity18 , like the 54 other institutions on the @entity0 's list ( and the numerous other at - fault schools , like @entity86 , that have , for now , avoided censure ) do their best to explain away accusations that for years , they 've allowed their students to get away with sexual assault or rape . one survey of two universities estimated that female students had a one in five chance of being sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years . by failing to protect their students and not properly disciplining assailants , universities are in violation of @entity99 of the 1972 @entity100 . @entity99 , so often associated with athletic funding , also requires universities receiving federal funding to provide equal access to education for all students , regardless of gender . university administrators are falling short if they allow a culture of sexual violence to flourish . thanks to the tireless efforts of young activists -- like the students and recent graduates who founded the @entity116 campaign -- this issue is finally getting more attention . a new @entity120 task force has released policy recommendations for campuses ( and two star - studded psas ) and the @entity0 has stepped in . the @entity126 administration 's strong support for survivors of campus assault -- not just the usual platitudes and policy band - aids -- is a crucial step in the right direction . but other stakeholders -- namely alumni and parents -- need to join this fight as well . in june , alumni of all ages will be heading back to their alma maters for college reunions -- an exercise of school pride and , in many cases , hefty alumni donations . at @entity18 , the event is a three - day booze - soaked party of self - congratulation , and a chance to celebrate " the best damn place of all . " if alumni , in good conscience , want to wear school gear or stick school bumper stickers on their cars , they must take on the issue of campus sexual assault . to do that , they will need to speak the language that these institutions understand : money , and press . if alumni with the power to pull large donations refused to give money to their universities until sexual assault is taken seriously , we 'd see an immediate change on campuses . similarly , if parents were vocal about their concerns at sending their kids to a place where they might very well be assaulted or raped , or spend four years being covertly ( and overtly ) told that committing rape is acceptable , universities would scramble to improve and , more to the point , enforce , their policies . ultimately , efforts to prevent sexual violence on college campuses have to be motivated by something beyond a desire to protect a university 's bottom line , or to avoid negative press coverage . universities have to be motivated by the sincere belief that all students have a right to an education not marred by fear of violence or memory of violence , and by a deep and genuine investment in the safety of all students . as it stands , the words we hear from some of our nation 's top universities do n't match their actions . they have spent years letting down students , parents , and alumni , by making it easy for their students to commit assault or rape . it 's time to hold them accountable .	@entity1:U.S.	@entity0:Department of Education	@entity13:William and Mary	@entity12:UVA	@entity11:Emory	@entity10:Harvard	@entity15:University of Michigan	@entity18:Princeton	@entity100:Education Amendments	@entity116:Know Your IX	@entity14:Tufts	@entity86:Yale	@entity126:Obama	@entity99:Title IX	@entity223:Angyal	@entity120:White House
@entity15 announced plans to shut down @placeholder brand after @entity18 fails to reach deal	@entity4	spring hill , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the town that @entity4 put on the map is worried about its future and its residents hope the auto plant and jobs wo n't go the way of its most famous product . the move to shut down @entity4 has left some in @entity14 , @entity1 , disappointed and perplexed . @entity15 announced this week that it would close its @entity4 line after its sale to @entity18 fell through . at the end of " @entity20 " in @entity14 , @entity1 , sits the huge plant where -- as the ads touted -- " a different kind of car company " produced a " different kind of car . " the first @entity4 , a red @entity27 , rolled off the line in 1990 and it 's still on display at the factory . the factory , along with the town , have played a major role in the company 's image and advertisements , even hosting tours and " reunions " for @entity4 car owners . at @entity41 , the walls are decorated with old photos of the small town @entity14 was before @entity4 came to town and what it 's grown into . " i think people are very proud an @entity49 - made car was made here , " area resident @entity46 said . mayor @entity51 credits most of the town 's growth to the @entity4 plant . " @entity15 , back in the mid 80 's , is the reason this town began to grow in the first place , " he said . eventually , @entity15 decided to move production elsewhere . the last @entity4 made in @entity1 rolled off the line in 2007 . after retooling , @entity15 started building the @entity60 in @entity14 , but that production is now on its way out too . in november , it will be moved to a plant in @entity64 , leaving @entity14 's plant idle . the move to shut down @entity4 has left some in town disappointed and perplexed . " it 's been a great car , " remarked @entity69 who runs an auto repair shop a few miles from the factory . @entity69 said he hoped @entity18 would have been able to keep the brand viable . " he has a track record that wo n't quit of being a great business man and a good leader . i do n't know what happened , " @entity69 said . @entity46 said she was also stunned about the end of @entity4 . " i 'm like everyone else , ' how can this happen ? ' @entity15 has been a forerunner in the automobile industry , and it 's just a really sad indictment on what is happening , " she said . " we are kind of curious as to why the decisions have been made that have been made , " @entity51 said . " i do know that what @entity15 is trying to do now as a company -- as far as how they are trying to operate and what they are saying the improvements they need to make -- almost mirror what @entity4 was 20 years ago . " resident @entity96 puts the blame squarely on the federal government . " it 's an abomination what the government is doing to the automotive industry ... get it out of the government 's hands . they do n't know how to do cars . they can hardly do the government . " as for the future of @entity14 , @entity51 is optimistic . " i have to believe the plant is going to come back . it all depends on the overall economy , " he said . " i hope that @entity49 start buying @entity49 products and start supporting the @entity49 auto manufacturing industry and if that happens , we 'll get a product in this plant . " @entity51 said he has been working with @entity15 on a daily basis , and has invited president @entity122 and the auto recovery czar to come and tour the plant .

scientists have analyzed @placeholder 's skeletal remains to see how he was killed	@entity0	@entity0 was the last @entity1 king to lose his life on the battlefield . scientists who have been testing his remains -- found under a parking lot in the @entity1 city of @entity8 -- now believe they know how he died . the 15th - century king was best known to modern @entity10 as the hunchbacked @entity12 villain accused of murdering his nephews , the " @entity13 , " to usurp the throne . his life has always been a controversial chapter in @entity1 lore . although he ruled for only two years ( 1483 - 85 ) and died at the age of 32 , there has been an ongoing debate over @entity0 's portrayal in both @entity1 history and @entity1 literature . according to historians , the king 's defeat and death at @entity27 ended the @entity29 and marked the end of the @entity31 in @entity1 . though he was a royal , his body was given to local monks , and he was buried in a crude grave in an unknown location . it was not until archaeologists from the @entity38 discovered his remains under a parking lot in 2012 that people learned where his body had been buried . since that time , both scientists and medical researchers have studied the remains to better understand how @entity0 lived and died . now , researchers have used modern forensic analysis to reveal that he suffered 11 injuries at or near the time of death , according to a new study published in @entity52 . of those , three had the potential to cause death quickly : two to the skull and one to the pelvis . and the scientists believe that the skull injuries were the ones that killed the last monarch from the @entity62 . @entity8 to be final burial place of @entity0 " @entity0 's injuries represent a sustained attack or an attack by several assailants with weapons from the later medieval period , " said professor @entity64 , one of the authors of the study . " the wounds to the skull suggest that he was not wearing a helmet , and the absence of defensive wounds on his arms and hands indicate that he was otherwise still armored at the time of his death . " the injury to his pelvis might have been inflicted after his death , the team surmised , since the kind of armor that would have been worn by the king in the late 15th century would have protected that area . " i think the most surprising injury is the one to the pelvis , " @entity64 said . " we believe that this corresponds to contemporary accounts of @entity0 being slung over the back of the horse to be taken back to @entity8 after the @entity27 , as this would give someone the correct body position to inflict this injury . " there were nine injuries to the skull in total and two elsewhere on the skeleton . the team used whole - body ct scans and @entity108 imaging of injured bones to analyze trauma , according to a news release from @entity52 . they also looked at tool marks on the bones to try to establish what kind of weapons were used . " the most likely injuries to have caused the king 's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon , such as a halberd or bill , and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon , " said professor @entity116 , a co-author of the study . " @entity0 's head injuries are consistent with some near - contemporary accounts of the battle , which suggest that @entity0 abandoned his horse after it became stuck in a mire and was killed while fighting his enemies . " although the findings are interesting to historians , the question remains : do they change the accounts of @entity0 's last moments in battle ? since none of the wounds overlapped , the researchers were not able to tell in exactly what order they occurred . " the ( investigators ) provide a compelling account , giving tantalizing glimpses into the validity of the historic accounts of his death , which were heavily edited by the @entity159 in the following 200 years , " said @entity149 of the @entity150 in @entity151 . " i am sure that @entity0 will continue to divide opinion fiercely for centuries to come . " after a legal battle , it has been decided that the medieval king will be reburied next spring in @entity165 , just a stone 's throw from where his remains were uncovered . bones reveal king 's taste for luxury food , wine @entity0 had worms , scientists say	@entity31:Middle Ages	@entity108:micro-CT	@entity1:England	@entity0:Richard III	@entity13:Princes in the Tower	@entity12:Shakespearean	@entity10:Britons	@entity38:University of Leicester	@entity8:Leicester	@entity149:Heather Bonney	@entity27:Battle of Bosworth	@entity116:Guy Rutty	@entity159:Tudors	@entity165:Leicester Cathedral	@entity29:Wars of the Roses	@entity151:London	@entity52:The Lancet	@entity62:House of York	@entity64:Hainsworth	@entity150:Natural History Museum

ceo says @placeholder ' are n't scared ' of economic downturn	@entity74	( @entity0 ) -- it 's been a big year for @entity3 's airline industry . in june , the country 's flag carrier lan completed its takeover of @entity8 's biggest airline @entity7 . in recent weeks the aptly named merged group , @entity9 , has welcomed the continent 's first ever dreamliner 787 to its runways . another one is due to touchdown before the end of 2012 - and a further 30 will arrive within the next ten years . the $ 4.9 billion order represents one of the largest investments in @entity4 's history . @entity9 's ceo @entity18 says it will make a big difference to the firm 's growth strategy and hopes to get commercial flights running as soon as possible . " @entity24 is going to start flying as of two weeks from now to @entity25 , just to train pilots , " he told @entity0 's @entity23 . " once they are trained they will start flying to @entity29 and after that initial phase of two months , there will be aircraft for @entity33 . they will fly @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 . " despite the formation of the @entity9 , @entity4 and @entity7 will continue to operate as separate entities for the time being . the new @entity41 will fly under the @entity4 branding , as its parent group is keen to capitalize on the weight of the individual brands in their respective regional markets . " when you integrate companies which are as big as @entity4 and @entity7 , there are so many opportunities and so much money in terms of pursuing things . you have to have a very clear head in term of what not to do . " we do n't see right now a value to the customer in integrating the brands - we have two wonderful brands . @entity7 is highly valued in @entity8 and abroad and @entity4 is a household name in @entity64 . it 's a wonderful problem to have . " despite the global downturn , @entity9 's main goal is growth through its existing route network domestically , regionally and internationally . mr @entity18 added : " in the last few years our planes are filled much more on the @entity64 end than on the developed markets end . we are feeling that slow down of the economy . " but we are @entity74 . we lived with ups and downs for years , so this is far from scary for us . " with a significant number of @entity41 already ordered , there are obviously no plans by @entity9 to take it one plane at a time . and mr @entity18 has spoken of his hopes to buy even more of the aircraft , thanks to an increased balanced sheet provided by the recent merger . " our financial strengths will be increased by having a larger operation , " he said . " we will be able to buy more of these planes in very good financial conditions , which have also been traditional advantages of these companies . " as i said we increase our ability to fly to more places because of traffic rights , so there is a bunch of opportunities that open for us as a result of the integration . " a key decision that has n't been made since june 's merger , is which air alliance @entity9 will be joining . there are two options to choose from , @entity7 's current deal with @entity107 -- or , more likely , @entity109 's agreement with @entity110 . mr @entity18 says he wo n't be pushed on giving an answer and no concrete decision has yet been made .

@placeholder says " sequel " infringes on copyright of his classic novel	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- reclusive author @entity1 has emerged , at least in the pages of court documents , to try to stop a novel that presents @entity5 , the disaffected teen hero of his classic " @entity10 , " as an old man . @entity1 has stayed out of the public eye for most of the past half century . lawyers for @entity1 filed suit in federal court this week to stop the publication , sale and advertisement of " 60 years later : coming through the @entity26 , " a novel written by an author calling himself @entity20 and published by a @entity22 company that advertises joke books and a " sexual dictionary " on its web site . " the sequel infringes @entity1 's copyright rights in both his novel and the character @entity5 , who is the narrator and essence of that novel , " said the suit , filed monday in @entity28 in @entity29 . published in 1951 , " @entity10 " is an iconic take on teen alienation that is consistently listed among the greatest @entity40 - language novels ever written . @entity1 , 90 , who has famously lived the life of a recluse in @entity43 for most of the past half - century , last published in 1965 . with the exception of a 1949 movie based on one of his early short stories , he has never authorized adaptations of any of his work , even turning down an overture from director @entity52 to make " catcher " into a movie . " there 's no more to @entity5 . read the book again . it 's all there , " the court filing quotes @entity1 as saying in 1980 . " @entity5 is only a frozen moment in time . " the filing refers to the new book 's author as " @entity63 , " saying that the name @entity65 probably is made up . the first - time novelist 's biography on @entity68 says @entity20 is the son of a @entity22 mother and @entity72 father who was named after the state where he was born . it claims he is a former gravedigger and triathlete who found a copy of @entity1 's novel " in an abandoned cabin in rural @entity80 " and that it helped him survive " the most maniacal of tropical fevers and chronic isolation . " the web site 's description of the book is written in the same choppy , first - person stream of consciousness that @entity1 employs as @entity5 wanders the streets of @entity29 . it describes a character , " mr. c , " who flees his nursing home and " embarks on a curious journey through the streets of @entity29 . " the lawsuit names @entity22 publisher @entity97 ; its offshoot , @entity99 ; and @entity20 - based @entity100 as defendants . the web site for @entity97 advertises such books as " the @entity104 " and " @entity105 , " which it describes as an erotic " flick book . " @entity107 , @entity1 's @entity29 - based attorney , declined to speak on the record , citing her client 's private nature . e-mail messages to @entity97 were not returned wednesday . @entity112 , president of @entity100 , said the people behind the new book plan to defend it against the lawsuit . " we believe we have the right to distribute this book and the publishers believe they have the right to publish it , " he said . @entity112 , whose company distributes books by about 150 publishers , called " 60 years later " a work of " social science fiction , " saying that @entity20 does n't plagiarize , but sets a well - known character in an alternate place and time -- as literature has done for centuries . " it 's amazing , " he said of the book . " if it was something else , or it felt like a knock - off or whatever , i would have told the publisher we would n't do it . but it 's really just amazing . " despite his cloistered lifestyle , @entity1 nods to the contemporary marketplace in the lawsuit , noting that , as of last week , " ' @entity10 ' currently sells more copies on @entity68 than ' @entity142 , ' ' @entity143 , ' ' @entity144 ' or ' @entity145 . ' " a hearing in the case is expected monday . @entity1 's lawyers will ask a judge to freeze publication of the book until a final ruling is made . the book is already available in @entity154 and the @entity155 , and is scheduled to be released in the @entity72 in september . the lawsuit asks that sales be halted and that books already distributed be recalled and destroyed . the argument is reminiscent of the legal tussle over the 2001 novel " @entity161 , " a parody of @entity163 's " @entity166 " told from the perspective of a slave . @entity163 's estate argued that the book , by novelist @entity168 , infringed upon her copyright . but the 11th @entity171 ruled in @entity173 's favor , saying the book was protected as a parody of a well - known work . @entity1 's lawyers say " 60 years later " deserves no such protection . " the sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original , " the lawsuit argues . " it is a rip - off pure and simple .

" the first stage was the local @entity7 embassy asking us to withdraw the film , " festival director @entity33 said sunday . " the second was to find a way for other @entity7 films to withdraw from the festival -- five did so . we believe that this is probably not the end of it . " organizers have also been " bombarded " with threatening e-mails , @entity33 said . watch @entity33 discuss the harassment ¬ª " i could n't repeat the language even if i tried , " he said . " lots of f - words and c - words , calling us racists , haters of @entity7 people . " the first attacks came soon after the festival opened saturday . several others followed throughout the day . in one , visitors to the site were greeted with a pop - up message that said : " we like film but we hate @entity10 . " the message was accompanied by a @entity7 flag and ended with : " please apologize to all the @entity7 people . " that attack was traced to an it professional in @entity66 , @entity7 , @entity33 said . " he admitted hacking the site . he said he was acting as a private citizen and was protesting the film , " he said . authorities are investigating the source of the other attacks , but they appeared to be from different sources . " we 're managing to plug leaks as fast as we can , " @entity33 said . the first screening of the documentary takes place sunday night . the filmmakers have invited @entity10 to attend another screening , scheduled for early august . " every year , there 's some level of controversy , from pro-life or anti-death ( penalty ) sort of position . we 've never had an incident of an international scale before , " @entity33 said . " the timing has absolutely been a critical one . " the rioting in the @entity13 region earlier this month stemmed from a brawl between @entity11 and @entity97 workers at a toy factory in another part of @entity7 . @entity97 make up the majority population in @entity7 -- and many uyghurs resent the presence of @entity97 in @entity13 , many of whom came looking for work . two uyghurs reportedly died in the toy factory brawl . to protest the deaths , @entity11 took to the streets in @entity13 's capital @entity110 -- and fighting broke out between the two sides , with deadly results .	@entity17:Melbourne International Film Festival	@entity22:The 10 Conditions of Love	@entity33:Moore	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:China	@entity11:Uyghurs	@entity10:Rebiya Kadeer	@entity9:Uyghur leader	@entity4:Australia	@entity66:Shanghai	@entity14:Washington	@entity110:Urumqi	@entity97:Han	@entity13:Xinjiang	@entity28:World Uyghur Congress
@entity9 , ex-boyfriend on trial in death of @entity9 's @entity13 housemate , @placeholder	@entity11	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 student @entity3 , accused of killing her housemate two years ago , testified in her murder trial saturday that she was intimidated by @entity1 police during questioning . @entity4 college student @entity3 , 21 , testifies friday at her murder trial in @entity0 , @entity1 . @entity9 , 21 , is charged in the death of @entity13 student @entity11 , who was her housemate in @entity0 , a university town north of @entity16 . @entity17 , 20 , died in what prosecutors say was a " drug - fueled sex game " after suffering a sexual assault . she was found half - naked , with a stab wound to her neck , in her bed november 2 , 2007 . saturday was the second day of testimony for @entity9 , who is from @entity26 , @entity27 . the public prosecutor , her defense lawyer , the attorney for her then - boyfriend @entity31 , and the judge asked her about what happened the night of @entity17 's death and the following day . both @entity9 and @entity31 , 25 , are charged with murder and sexual assault . @entity9 tried to explain saturday why she gave conflicting answers to police when they interrogated her on november 6 . she said it was a combination of police pressure , their suggestions , and her confused and frightened state of mind . " when i would say that i was with @entity31 , they would say , ' you are a liar , ' and they repeated this , " she said , testifying in fluent @entity1 . " you will go to prison for 30 years . ... you must remember , " @entity9 recalled the police as saying . @entity9 said the police were standing behind her and officers were going in and out of the interrogation room . a policewoman next to her was constantly pressing her to give them a name , and an interpreter on her right said people under trauma tend to forget things , she said . " i was confused . ... i had so much fear , " @entity9 said . she testified that she thought , " hell , perhaps they 're right and i have forgotten . " @entity9 repeated saturday that police slapped her on the back of her head while questioning her . as she spoke , she hit her head a few times with her right hand and gestured broadly . @entity9 testified friday that she was not at the women 's villa the night @entity17 died , which authorities believe was the evening of november 1 . she said she was at @entity31 's house . watch @entity9 take the stand ¬ª @entity9 testified friday that the couple had dinner , watched a movie , smoked marijuana , had sex and went to bed on the night of november 1 . she said she returned to her and @entity17 's villa the next morning to take a shower . that 's when she said she noticed " strange things " such as the front door being left open , dried blood in the bathroom sink and on a bath mat , feces in the toilet , and the door to @entity17 's room locked . watch @entity9 in court ¬ª when @entity9 returned to @entity31 's house , she said , he suggested they call police in case the house had been burglarized . police then found @entity17 's body . all cameras were barred from the courtroom saturday because the public prosecutor said he wanted to avoid " sensationalism . " cameras were allowed at the beginning of the session friday but then ordered out . @entity9 's father , @entity112 , defended his daughter saturday . " what we 've seen over the past five months is a character assassination , and now , hopefully ... . a different point of view of who she is is coming out , " he told reporters . people are beginning to see that " she is not this dark angel she 's been portrayed as , " he added . " @entity3 did a great job " on the stand , @entity9 said . " she was very articulate in her answers . she answered all of the questions truthfully . she was not quivering in her voice . she was looking the judge in the eyes .

from @placeholder 's @entity6 to @entity9 's @entity10 , muses inspire great artists	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- throughout history , the greatest artists have relied on their muses to inspire , enchant and satisfy them . @entity5 immortalized mistress @entity6 in his 1937 painting @entity8 , @entity9 catapulted model @entity10 to " @entity14 " status in his 1960s avant - garde films , while @entity15 made the woman behind his " @entity17 " perhaps the most famous muse of all time . but the elusive figure of the muse does n't always have to be that of a beautiful woman . the dark beauty with flowing locks and sinewy limbs depicted in artist @entity28 's latest painting is n't a luscious lady -- it 's a horse . not just any horse , but arguably the greatest race horse of all time . since demolishing the field in his first major win at the @entity38 in 2010 , an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred @entity40 . the superstar colt , who even has its own twitter handle , has not just won all 14 of his races -- he has won them by staggering margins , destroying world - class fields , becoming by a distance the top - rated race horse on the planet . in his last race , the thoroughbred won the @entity53 at @entity54 , with a sell - out crowd of 32,000 catching a final glimpse of the now - celebrity horse as as he powered to a dramatic victory . writer @entity66 's personal " @entity40 moment " came earlier in the horse 's stellar career , an experience which later paved the way for artist @entity28 to paint his unusual surrealist work . " i had been watching last year 's 2000 guineas race on tv when @entity40 just pounded the other horses into the ground , " said @entity66 . " he easily won by a good six lengths -- none of the others even came close . " in my mind 's eye i saw @entity40 smashing through the screen into my living room ; this powerful , beautiful , almost mythical beast . " a 51 - year - old former solicitor from @entity80 in north - east @entity81 , @entity66 was so moved by @entity40 's win he wrote a poem about the centaur - like creature bursting into his suburban home in a blaze of glory . it read in part : " then a smell of burnt air mixed with horse - flesh when the telly exploded in his face as the @entity40 centaur burst in green and pink silk , fluid powerful grace . " it was a special sporting moment and had a profound effect on @entity66 , who described @entity40 's win as akin to watching boxer @entity101 or footballer @entity102 in action . " it was one of those rare times when you get a sense you 've just witnessed somebody or something at the very pinnacle of sporting prowess , " he said . " @entity113 words are never good enough to do it justice . " and so @entity66 enlisted @entity28 , a lecturer at the @entity116 in @entity117 ( @entity116 ) to paint the champion horse powering into a suburban living room , knocking @entity66 and his wife from their chairs and spilling their afternoon gin and tonics to the floor . " the result is a surreal cocktail of his words and my interpretation in art form , " @entity28 said . " the modern domestic scene is shattered by the magisterial beast that is @entity40 . " @entity28 painted the work , called " @entity135 , " in egg tempura ; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the @entity140 . the method , which gives a luminous quality , was later superseded by oil painting around the 15th century . " it has a kind of stained glass quality to it , like shining a light from behind , " said @entity28 . " the pinks and blues of @entity40 's silks are quite strong and i thought they really lent themselves to the medium . " @entity28 is perhaps best known for his paintings of @entity81 football scenes , such as " @entity156 , " which captures the unusual tradition of @entity160 fans throwing celery , or " @entity162 , " which portrays sporting revelry in a pub. after saturday though , and @entity28 will be painting fabulous @entity40 smashing not just a tv screen , but the record books all over again .	@entity28:Kirkbride	@entity80:Sunderland	@entity116:RADA	@entity113:Mere	@entity135:Armchair Ride	@entity156:Chech Mates	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:Champion thoroughbred Frankel	@entity6:Dora Maar	@entity5:Picasso	@entity9:Andy Warhol	@entity8:Weeping Woman	@entity53:Champion Stakes	@entity54:Ascot	@entity17:Mona Lisa	@entity15:Leonardo da Vinci	@entity14:It Girl	@entity10:Edie Sedgwick	@entity38:Royal Lodge Stakes	@entity101:Muhammad Ali	@entity102:Lionel Messi	@entity162:Bar Kick	@entity117:London	@entity160:Chelsea	@entity140:1st Century	@entity81:English	@entity183:Champions Stakes	@entity40:Frankel	@entity66:Ward
@placeholder tops @entity85 after beating @entity63	@entity96	( @entity0 ) -- it was the first win in three @entity3 qualifying games for the mighty @entity4 but another unconvincing performance by @entity4 against the minnows of @entity7 friday . the @entity9 winner was expected to at least match the seven goals that both @entity11 and @entity12 had put past @entity7 in their last two @entity13 matches , but only managed four . perhaps suffering a hangover from its @entity16 triumph , defeats to @entity11 and a draw against the @entity12 , have left @entity4 in third place in the group . @entity7 , who only became a full @entity22 member last year and are not recognized by @entity23 , have only one full - time professional in its lineup , @entity26 from third - flight @entity28 side @entity27 . but it put on a battling performance against a near full strength team picked by @entity4 coach @entity33 and deployed in an attacking 3 - 5 - 2 formation . @entity9 hero @entity35 started the scoring and added a second , while fellow @entity39 star @entity38 was also on the score sheet before half time . the expected goal glut after the break did not materialize with the occasional jeer ringing around the stadium in @entity45 . the fourth , and only goal of the half , came on 67 minutes when @entity49 's cross was turned into his own net by visiting defender @entity51 . " i am anything but happy , the team did n't measure up the way we had wished , " @entity33 told reporters after the win .

a pair of @placeholder brothers are charged with felony trademark counterfeiting	@entity13	the counterfeits included everyday health and beauty items such as @entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity9 sanitary pads . a pair of @entity13 brothers will appear in court tuesday on charges of running a multimillion - dollar ring that peddled fake products distributed up and down the @entity18 , authorities said . @entity19 , 59 , and @entity20 , 60 , are accused of running an enterprise whose products also turned up in @entity23 and @entity24 , according to the @entity26 district attorney 's office . authorities seized more than $ 2 million worth of products and were looking at bank accounts to determine the size of the enterprise . law enforcement authorities seized four tractor - trailers filled with knockoff health products from five locations on @entity36 on thursday . a manufacturer described the operation as the biggest known counterfeit enterprise in the @entity41 , while another company called it the only known such manufacturing operation in the country for its products , prosecutors said . @entity19 and @entity20 , both charged with felony trademark counterfeiting , were being held on bond of $ 100,000 each , the district attorney 's office said . the allegation that @entity19 was involved with his brother 's business are " outlandish , " said @entity19 's attorney , @entity54 . @entity20 's attorney , @entity55 , did not return calls seeking comment . " health and beauty products like lip balms , oils , shampoos and inhalers are highly regulated in order to protect consumers , but these defendants are charged with going around those protections and stealing the brands of major corporations that comply with the law , " district attorney @entity58 said in the statement . " these actions can endanger the public . " the fake products included @entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity7 and @entity9 sanitary pads ; the producers of the real products include major international brands such as @entity6 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , prosecutors said . other products , including over-the - counter cold medicines and painkillers , also were recovered , officials said . " we encourage consumers to be cautious about buying branded goods that look suspicious , or from outlets that are unfamiliar , " @entity90 , a spokesman for @entity84 , said in a statement . the case came to light when @entity98 officials in january conducted a building inspection at the site of a fire a year earlier . @entity103 officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers , who verified the counterfeits . fire department officials said they found manufacturing supplies but no material safety data sheets , which normally accompany these supplies . the brothers are accused of selling the products to distributors who , in turn , delivered them to retailers in @entity13 , @entity23 and @entity24 . an investigation is underway to determine if there are more locations . the prosecutor 's office is trying to determine the chemical makeup of the products and the health risks , if any , associated with them . authorities gave the following tips to identify fakes : look for signs such as strange pictures on the package or strange colors or typeface . some sophisticated knockoffs may be hard to detect , but the price may be atypically low . counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products . shop at established and trusted stores , which are likely to be connected to legitimate supply chains .	@entity23:Pennsylvania	@entity20:Mullick	@entity26:Nassau County	@entity24:Florida	@entity83:Pfizer	@entity84:Procter & Gamble	@entity85:Unilever	@entity7:Vaseline	@entity6:Johnson	@entity5:Baby Oil	@entity4:ChapStick	@entity9:Always	@entity78:Vicks Inhaler	@entity55:Michael Brown	@entity54:Steve Christiansen	@entity77:Vicks VapoRub	@entity58:Kathleen Rice	@entity13:New York	@entity36:Long Island	@entity19:Malik	@entity18:East Coast	@entity103:Nassau County Fire Marshall	@entity98:Valley Stream Fire Department	@entity90:Chris Vuturo	@entity41:United States
support for president @placeholder , congressional democrats slip among liberals	@entity25	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- health care reform is a signature issue for @entity4 , but the attempt to overhaul the nation 's health system has pitted liberals against centrists , exposing fissures 11 months before the 2010 midterm elections . a year ago @entity4 were united in victory after winning back the @entity13 and picking up additional seats in @entity15 . but with victory comes expectations that are accentuated when a party controls both ends of @entity20 . for @entity4 , it is the party 's political base -- voters who turned out in 2008 to help elect @entity25 president and boost the @entity27 majorities in the @entity13 and @entity28 -- which is demanding results . simply by the numbers , the health care overhaul should easily pass @entity15 . @entity4 comfortably control the @entity32 , and with the assistance of two @entity27 - allied independents have the 60 votes needed to overcome a @entity37 filibuster in the @entity28 . except it is not about numbers on health care . it is about differences in ideology on the public option and abortion that has slowed down the bill . @entity48 advocacy organizations wasted little time this week condemning @entity27 leaders when news broke that a @entity28 deal had been struck to replace the public option with another proposal to help cover the uninsured . the deal was intended to address concerns by some centrist @entity4 over the public option . the news enraged some liberal activists . @entity61 organizers sent a note to the e-mail boxes of its 5 million members . it opened with three words : " how could they ? " " @entity4 have just announced a tentative health care deal that does n't appear to include a real public health insurance option , " the organizers wrote in the note . " instead of pulling out all the stops , they 've bargained away the heart of health care reform -- allowing conservative senators like @entity76 and @entity77 to hold the process hostage and protect @entity79 . " @entity76 is an independent from @entity81 politically aligned to the @entity27 . @entity77 is a centrist @entity82 from @entity83 . the @entity84 was more aggressive in its reaction . " this is outrageous , " @entity84 officials wrote in an e-mail that was sent to 300,000 people . " we need to fight back now . " the fissures in the @entity27 do not end at health care . the president 's decision to send 30,000 additional @entity95 troops to @entity96 was met with skepticism by some @entity27 lawmakers and outright opposition by others . the decision frustrated anti-war groups . " in terms of the policy , i think it is a dreadful mistake , " said former rep. @entity103 , a @entity104 @entity82 who is national director of @entity105 . " the whole idea of getting out of @entity96 by escalating is like fighting a fire by throwing gasoline on it . " some liberals express concern that policy decisions made by the @entity25 administration and @entity27 leaders could hurt the party in the 2010 elections . " i think the @entity27 base -- the danger is it becomes a no - show in 2010 , " @entity103 said . " an element that was so critical to the success in 2006 and 2008 is going to be on the sidelines . people are going to be so dispirited . " @entity127 , @entity61 's director of political advocacy , echoed @entity103 ' concern and said that while @entity61 members " trust " @entity25 , " they are sincerely concerned about the gap between his campaign promises and the reality of the legislation that is being passed . " " i think we are going to see , if this trajectory plays out , a depression in 2010 and that is deeply concerning , " she said . an analysis of @entity1 polling indicates that support for the president and congressional @entity4 has slipped among self - described liberals . in june , a @entity148 poll showed that @entity25 had an 89 percent favorable rating with liberals . in december , his favorable rating with this group fell to 73 percent . in october , a @entity1 / @entity154 poll showed @entity4 had an 87 percent favorable rating with liberals on the generic congressional ballot . it has since dropped to 79 percent . " from @entity96 to the public option to abortion to the economy , the past few months have seen president @entity25 and @entity4 in @entity15 taking actions that some liberals do n't like , " said @entity158 , @entity1 's polling director . at the same time , @entity25 is facing increasing pressure from the @entity165 to pay more attention to issues affecting the @entity169 - @entity95 community . rep. @entity170 , @entity171 , issued a statement following the president 's economic speech this week that prodded him to do as much . " while we agree with the president that support for small businesses , infrastructure investment and green jobs is essential , we also believe that much more needs to be done , particularly for those @entity95 who are hurting most , " said @entity175 , chairwoman of the caucus . one of the more troubling signs for @entity4 , perhaps , is that liberal advocacy groups have been spending money on television ads targeting @entity27 lawmakers on health care . after the @entity13 approved its health care bill , @entity61 ran tv ads against seven @entity27 lawmakers criticizing them for voting against it . the @entity84 also has run ads against @entity4 as has @entity196 , an umbrella group that represents 1,000 organizations , including major unions and liberal - leaning groups . there is even an organization that is trying to recruit liberal candidates to challenge more conservative democrats in next year 's primaries . but for all the talk of @entity27 infighting , a senior official at the @entity206 shrugged it off and said disagreements are par for the course when you have a " big tent " party . " what is occurring in the @entity27 is no different than what always occurs in the @entity27 , " said @entity215 , the @entity206 communications director . " it is the most diverse collection of people and ideas of any political party that has walked the face of the earth ... from the very liberal members to the very conservative members . it really is no surprise that when you have such a big and diverse party there are going to be differences .

rebels attack a @placeholder army base north of @entity4 ; troops fire back in 3 directions	@entity0	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity0 troops at a besieged military base just north of @entity4 fired out in three directions on sunday in the face of a rebel onslaught , part of a high - stakes battle for a city where a top regional leader claimed war crimes are being committed . for days , anti-government forces have been trying to take over the northern @entity0 city , where many residents appear to support their cause , only to be answered by fierce fighting by the @entity0 military . the fight for the military base is one of many hotspots of violence raging around @entity4 , which is the commercial and cultural center of the @entity26 nation and its largest city . @entity1 's @entity28 inside @entity0 yet it is indicative , in many ways , of what 's going on , with the rebels attacking from seemingly many different directions and scores of troops inside firing back furiously with machine guns -- oftentimes straight into neighboring villages . @entity38 and shells routinely land in residential communities , many of which are largely deserted as civilians flee the area . on sunday , families continued to use motorcycles , cars and whatever other means to escape the city . they are among the roughly 200,000 people in @entity4 and surrounding areas to flee shelling and heavy weapon fire over the past two days , according to @entity54 , the @entity56 's under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs . @entity57 , the head of the @entity58 , said sunday in a statement that his group supports calls from the @entity0 opposition for an emergency @entity64 meeting to address the situation in @entity4 . @entity57 added that the group believes war crimes are being committed in the city . officials from the @entity58 are planning visits to @entity72 and @entity73 hoping to persuade the superpowers , which have vetoed several resolutions over @entity0 , to change their stance , he said . the regional group 's statement came hours after @entity0 's top diplomat delivered ominous words about the battle for @entity4 , vowing that rebel troops would not gain control of the city . " since last week , ( opposition fighters ) planned for whatever they called the ' great @entity95 battle , ' but they have failed after one week , " foreign minister @entity85 said during a trip to @entity87 , one of his nation 's few remaining allies , in referring to a rebel offensive beaten back earlier this month . " that 's why they moved to @entity4 , and i can assure you that they will fail .

now @placeholder says the video game 's producers should pay him part of the profits	@entity0	former @entity1 dictator @entity0 has a message for the publishers of a popular video game that features a mission to capture him : you owe me money . in a lawsuit filed in @entity12 on tuesday , the 80 - year - old once known as one of @entity15 's most powerful strongmen accused the @entity17 video game company of harming his reputation with " @entity19 : @entity20 " @entity0 -- convicted of drug trafficking , money laundering and killing political opponents -- is serving out a prison sentence in @entity1 , where he was extradited in 2011 . he argues in the lawsuit that his portrayal " as a kidnapper , murderer and enemy of the state " in the 2012 video game damaged his reputation . the company used his image and name in order to make money , the lawsuit says , therefore he 's entitled to a share of the profits . " @entity40 was portrayed as an antagonist as the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes , creating the false impression that defendants are authorized to use plaintiff 's image and likeness , " the lawsuit says . @entity17 did not immediately respond to a request for comment . in 2012 , the company said " call of duty : @entity20 " had netted more than $ 1 billion in sales worldwide in its first months on the market . the video game includes historical footage and several real - life characters in @entity60 scenarios , including @entity61 . but while @entity62 did his own voice over for the game and acted as an adviser , @entity0 said in tuesday 's lawsuit that he was n't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness . former cia director gen. @entity69 is also depicted in a fictional scenario in the game as the secretary of defense in 2025 . @entity17 said in a 2012 statement that " including @entity69 and other real - life figures was strictly a creative decision made many months ago when the story line was drafted . " for almost two decades , @entity0 was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the @entity79 because of its location on the @entity81 , the key strategic and economic waterway between the @entity83 and @entity84 oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the @entity86 . amid growing unrest in @entity1 , then - @entity79 president @entity87 ordered the invasion of the @entity91 nation in december 1989 , saying @entity0 's rule posed a threat to @entity79 lives and property . @entity0 fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the @entity98 in @entity99 . he surrendered in january 1990 and was escorted to the @entity79 for civilian trial . @entity0 was indicted in the @entity79 on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking . he was accused of having links to @entity109 drug lord @entity108 's notorious @entity107 cartel and , in the process , amassing a multimillion - dollar fortune . he was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes and served nearly two decades in prison . in 2010 , a @entity116 court sentenced @entity0 to seven years in prison for laundering ‚Ç¨ 2.3 million ( $ 2.9 million ) through banks there . he was ordered to pay the money back . in @entity1 , where he was convicted of killing political opponents , he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence .	@entity20:Black Ops II	@entity107:Medellin	@entity116:French	@entity83:Atlantic	@entity84:Pacific	@entity86:Americas	@entity87:George H.W.

in @placeholder , @entity1 , you can see magnificent mountains and @entity11 ruins	@entity0	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- stand anywhere in the @entity1 town of @entity0 and look up . if your eyes do n't fix on a magnificent @entity8 mountain peak , then you will surely be looking at one of the @entity11 ruins in the immediate area . @entity0 offers spectacular views of a charming village , ancient ruins and magnificent mountains . no need to worry about a crick in your neck ; the view at eye level is just as pretty . there are no neon signs , no hotels or restaurants with names that you will recognize , just charming local businesses set on cobblestone streets . narrow chutes frame the streets and carry water from the mountaintops through town , toward the railroad tracks , and into the @entity36 . the locals are easily recognized in their brightly colored hand - woven clothing -- bright blue , orange and red shirts and skirts -- as they go about their daily business , whether tending the nearby fields or guiding a mule carrying firewood . when planning a trip to the area 's star attraction -- the mountaintop @entity11 ruins of @entity50 -- this gem of a town in @entity1 's @entity53 is not to be missed . the @entity53 is the area between @entity54 -- the historic capital of the @entity56 and the tourism gateway -- and @entity50 , which was recently voted one of the new seven wonders of the world . typically , visitors who plan to stay overnight in the @entity53 are trying to adjust to the altitude before heading to the higher and larger city of @entity54 . acclimating to elevations of more than 11,000 feet above sea level is a good reason to head directly down to the valley after arriving at the @entity69 , but the tiny town called @entity0 is another great reason to set aside at least a couple of your vacation days . @entity0 is one of those rare places where you 'd rather look at the beauty through the naked eye than through the lens of a camera . the camera just does n't seem to capture the " wow " factor . during the dry season from april to october , the sky between the surrounding peaks is often a piercing azure blue . but visitors ca n't be expected to stand on a street corner taking in the view all day , and thankfully , there is plenty to do in this old @entity11 village . the main attraction , the @entity95 , a former @entity11 fortress , attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market . from down the street , you can see the tourists climbing the many terraces that , during @entity11 times , were used for agriculture and decorative purposes . the highest point on the hill is where you will find the unfinished @entity111 of the sun. on tours , visitors learn that these ruins were built in the shape of a llama , and guides will point out the face of the @entity11 sun god carved on the side of the neighboring mountain . you need to purchase a ticket to visit this site . across town are other @entity11 sites , also visible from the town 's cobblestone corners , where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge . there are many nice walks around the town , and the local museum has a display on the wall that lists the time they should take and the area to cover . if you want a break from the ruins , try white - water rafting , mountain climbing or horseback riding . and if you ca n't get enough of the natural beauty , opt for a bicycle trip down the @entity148 . bicycle trip organizers will drive you up and drop you off on an asphalt road at about 14,000 feet above sea level , and you ride -- or really glide -- down on bicycles . make sure your body has acclimated to the altitude of @entity0 , which is about 9,186 feet , before you embark on this tour . the ride offers great views of the snow - capped @entity158 , and you 'll see livestock grazing and patches of land being tended by farmers . the entire trip takes from three to four hours and costs about $ 40 per person . once you have worked up an appetite , you can easily find a good meal in @entity0 . a hearty local dish , lomo saltado , is served in most restaurants . this @entity1 dish is a stir fry that includes steak tidbits , white rice , french fries , onions and tomatoes in a brown gravy . if lomo saltado is n't adventurous enough for you , try alpaca or cuy ( guinea pig ) . you can wash your meal down with a @entity185 sour , the national drink in @entity1 , made with @entity185 brandy , sugar , lemon juice and an egg white . there are enough restaurants to choose from , and in some establishments , the food is as good as the fancy places you will find in @entity54 . there are several trains a day between @entity0 and @entity50 , so it 's feasible to do a day trip to visit the main attraction . it 's about a two - hour drive to get to @entity0 from the airport or @entity54 's city center , and it costs no more than $ 30 @entity205 by taxi . buses are available and cost a lot less . whether you take the bus , train or taxi , consider a stop in this impressive @entity11 town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Peru	@entity0:Ollantaytambo	@entity50:Machu Picchu	@entity11:Incan	@entity36:Urubamba River	@entity8:Andes	@entity148:Ambra Malaga Pass	@entity185:Pisco	@entity53:Sacred Valley	@entity158:Mount Veronica	@entity56:Incan Empire	@entity111:Temple	@entity69:Cusco Airport	@entity95:Ollantaytambo Ruins	@entity54:Cusco	@entity205:U.S.	@entity220:Temple of the Sun

" the @entity23 exports to this region are essential to the president 's goal of doubling @entity23 exports in the next several years , " @entity18 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , told reporters in a briefing wednesday . " in fact , nearly all of the efforts that we 're going to be making towards that export goal take place in this part of the world . " the 21 members of the @entity37 account for 55 % of the world 's gross domestic product , 43 % of world trade and 58 % of @entity23 exports , according to the group . " so i think when the @entity23 people see the president traveling in the @entity4 , they will see him advocating for @entity23 jobs and @entity23 businesses , " @entity18 said . " he will be trying to open new markets , and he will be trying to achieve new export initiatives , and he will be trying to foster a trade agreement through the , for instance , the @entity48 , that takes us beyond the @entity54 towards a multilateral agreement that , again , has very high standards to ensure that our interests are being protected . " the @entity2 administration is pushing for the expanded trade agreement to help boost reduce barriers to @entity23 exports , boost trade and create jobs . the @entity23 has been negotiating with @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 develop the @entity48 , which the @entity23 trade representative @entity71 's office says would eventually expand to include most of the @entity37 's 21 nations . no final decisions are expected on the agreement this weekend . @entity18 said he expects the leaders to discuss progress negotiated at the ministerial level and begin looking toward the next phase of discussions . but he declined to put a timetable on the negotiations . during the @entity37 conference in @entity83 , @entity2 is also scheduled to have a discussion with business leaders , as well as side meetings with @entity88 prime minister @entity87 , @entity90 president @entity89 , and @entity92 president @entity91 . after a break monday for a political fundraiser , @entity2 is scheduled to depart tuesday for @entity67 and later @entity95 , @entity96 , where he will stress the @entity23 role in the @entity4 and seek to reassure @entity23 allies of the nation 's continued commitment to the region , @entity18 said . he is scheduled to leave @entity95 on november 19 .	@entity23:U.S.	@entity83:Honolulu	@entity87:Yoshihiko Noda	@entity88:Japanese	@entity89:Dimitry Medvedev	@entity2:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:Hawaii	@entity4:Asian-Pacific	@entity54:Korea Free Trade Agreement	@entity71:Ron Kirk	@entity37:APEC	@entity10:trans-Pacific	@entity18:Rhodes	@entity96:Indonesia	@entity95:Bali	@entity92:Chinese	@entity91:Hu Jintao	@entity90:Russian	@entity68:Peru	@entity69:Vietnam	@entity66:Brunei	@entity67:Australia	@entity64:Chile	@entity65:New Zealand	@entity48:Trans-Pacific Partnership	@entity63:Singapore
a @entity9 cable quotes @placeholder 's prime minister supporting @entity4 drone attacks	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- on the record , @entity1 has persistently criticized the @entity4 ' use of unmanned drones to attack militant hideouts in its mountainous border region . but diplomatic cables obtained by @entity9 reveal that in private the @entity1 government was not unhappy about the strikes and secretly allowed small groups of @entity4 special operations units to operate on its soil . in a cable sent in august 2008 , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity1 at the time , @entity16 , recounted a meeting with interior minister @entity19 and prime minister @entity20 . it coincided with a military operation in one of the restive frontier territories . @entity25 wrote , " @entity19 suggested we hold off alleged predator attacks until after the @entity29 operation . the @entity20 brushed aside @entity19 's remarks and said , ' i do n't care if they do it as long as they get the right people . we 'll protest in the @entity36 and then ignore it . ' " on wednesday , a governing party representative said there was some public support in @entity1 for @entity4 missile attacks on suspected militants . " there is a segment in the country who support the drone attacks , and they feel that drone attacks have been helpful in eliminating many of the militants , " @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 said . " but of course there is another point of view in the country who do not favor the drone attacks , and they think that drone attacks are intervention and violating our sovereignty , " she said . she did not directly answer a question about her party 's position on drones . she also said there is some " soft " support for militants in " every institution " in the country , including the military , but said the government did not " support those who are close to the militants . " asked about @entity83 's comment that there was some public support for drone strikes , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity81 stuck to the government 's official line . " no one supports drone attacks by the @entity4 , " @entity89 said wednesday . but other @entity4 records revealed by @entity9 make clear that there were meetings between @entity4 and @entity1 officials about drones . a @entity4 diplomat , based in @entity98 near the border territories , mentions in a 2008 cable a meeting he had with a senior official whose name is redacted . the official " said he wanted to say in an unofficial capacity that he and many others could accept predator strikes as they were surgical and clearly hitting high value targets . he mentioned that fear among the local populace in areas where the strikes have been occurring was lessening because ' everyone knew that they only hit the house or location of very bad people . ' " the same official painted a gloomy picture of the situation , saying , " our house is on fire and we need to take drastic actions , " according to the cable . it seems that @entity1 saw the drone attacks as so effective , it wanted some of its own . at a meeting in @entity141 in june 2009 attended by then - @entity4 national security adviser gen. @entity131 , president @entity139 " made repeated pleas for drones to be ' put in @entity1 's hands ' so that @entity1 would own the issue and drone attacks ( including collateral damage ) would not provoke @entity138 , " one cable says . @entity139 said the technology behind them was " not cutting - edge " and said he had raised the issue with the chairman of the @entity146 . similarly , @entity1 has been very sensitive to allegations that @entity4 combat forces are at work inside the country . but one cable from @entity25 written in october 2009 noted with satisfaction , " the @entity153 has for just the second time approved deployment of @entity4 special operation elements to support @entity1 military operations . the first deployment ... occurred in september . " that cable goes on to say that a request had come from the @entity1 military commander in @entity162 , lt. gen. @entity161 , for intelligence and reconnaissance assistance from @entity4 special operations units . that support would " include a live downlink of unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity169 ) full motion video , " it says . @entity25 adds that the move " appears to represent a sea change in @entity1 thinking . patient relationship - building with the military is the key factor that has brought us to this point . " but she cautions : " these deployments are highly politically sensitive because of widely held concerns among the public about @entity1 sovereignty and opposition to allowing foreign military forces to operate in any fashion on @entity1 soil . should these developments and / or related matters receive any coverage in the @entity1 or @entity4 media , the @entity1 military will likely stop making requests for such assistance . " during discussions on the militant threat , the @entity1 leadership stressed that a short - term victory was unlikely . according to one 2009 cable , @entity139 " cautioned that the fight against militant extremism would be a long one , lasting not months but many , many years and that lack of vigilance on the @entity205 's part would be devastating . " in this case , @entity205 refers to the government of @entity1 . @entity139 also did not miss the chance -- in speaking with @entity131 -- to have a poke at @entity1 's nemesis , accusing " @entity212 of providing the precursor chemicals necessary to produce heroin , which he said was funding the @entity216 in @entity217 . " at the same meeting , according to the cable , @entity139 praised the @entity212 prime minister , @entity220 , but with reservations . " @entity220 is an excellent economist , " he said , but he added that he thought @entity220 did not understand the constraints under which @entity139 was operating . the cables also reveal great sensitivity on the part of @entity1 to any perceived tilt by @entity227 in favor of @entity212 . a cable prepared this year for fbi director @entity230 says , " cooperation has frequently been hampered by suspicion in @entity1 's military and intelligence establishment about @entity4 intentions and objectives . among other things , the @entity1 believe that we have favored @entity212 over @entity1 -- most notably , by approving civil - nuclear cooperation with @entity212 -- and that we aim to dismantle @entity1 's nuclear weapons program , which , in light of their conventional military disadvantage vis - a - vis @entity212 , they consider critical to their national security . " referring to the @entity1 @entity216 , the same cable says gloomily , " in the midst of this difficult security situation , @entity1 's civilian government remains weak , ineffectual , and corrupt . " support for strikes there is some public support in @entity1 for @entity4 missile attacks on suspected militants in the country , a governing party representative conceded wednesday , diverging from the country 's official position on drone strikes . there is also some " soft " support for militants in " every institution " in the country , including the military , @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 told @entity0 . @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity81 , @entity89 , stuck to the government 's official line , that @entity4 drone attacks infringe on @entity1 sovereignty , when asked about @entity83 's remarks . @entity0 's @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report .	@entity20:Yousaf Raza Gilani	@entity169:UAV	@entity276:Luke Henderson	@entity25:Patterson	@entity29:Bajaur	@entity81:United Kingdom	@entity83:Wahab	@entity139:Zardari	@entity138:anti-Americanism	@entity153:Pakistani Army	@entity89:Wajid Hasan	@entity275:Ravi Agrawal	@entity131:Jones	@entity1:Pakistani	@entity0:CNN	@entity212:India	@entity4:U.S.	@entity9:WikiLeaks	@entity16:Anne Patterson	@entity36:National Assembly	@entity216:Taliban	@entity19:Rehman	@entity217:Afghanistan	@entity98:Peshawar	@entity205:GOP	@entity162:North and South Waziristan	@entity220:Singh	@entity146:Joint Chiefs of Staff	@entity161:Masood Aslam	@entity141:Islamabad	@entity227:Washington	@entity230:Robert Mueller	@entity44:Fauzia Wahab	@entity45:Pakistan People 's Party
@entity7 hit @placeholder as a hurricane and lingered , causing massive flooding	@entity6	for @entity1 , there 's no escaping the misery . because of @entity7 , @entity4 's home in @entity5 , @entity6 , is ruined by floodwaters . so , too , is the gas station and convenience store he owned and ran in the community , 15 miles by car and 10 miles as the crow flies from @entity15 . but all that pales to what @entity4 , the fire chief for @entity5 and @entity17 in @entity18 , saw when he and fellow volunteer firefighters steered their boat up to the home of a couple he knew . inside , they found the pair floating in the kitchen , the first of at least three fatalities in @entity6 being blamed on @entity7 . " it 's not something i want to see , and i hope it 's the last ones we do see , " said an exhausted @entity4 on friday , a day after he pulled the couple from the home . in terms of total deaths , @entity7 does n't compare to @entity37 , which led to nearly 1,800 fatalities in @entity15 and the vicinity seven years ago . @entity7 struck @entity6 on tuesday night as a category 1 hurricane , not a category 3 like @entity37 . do n't tell that , though , to the thousands of residents in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity18 and other parishes who friday found their homes and hometowns still deluged . even with a few drops of drizzle falling all day and with levels down considerably from the previous day , waters were still 10 feet deep in spots . " this is unbelievable . deja vu , man , " @entity56 , president of @entity18 said thursday as he surveyed the town of @entity58 , inundated by floodwater and sludge . " there is more water here than @entity37 . " it was a sentiment echoed by an assistant fire chief in the parish , while on a boat moving through an area in which floodwaters almost universally covered the first floor of 200 homes . red carpet still out for @entity15 tourists most people had heeded a mandatory evacuation order issue monday , but not all . video footage from @entity79 affiliate @entity15 @entity78 showed rescuers pulling out an ax and hacking an attic vent . soon after , 70 - year - old @entity83 climbed out and slid down his roof . rescuers also managed to get out his four dogs , one of whom fell into the water and another who jumped into a reporter 's arms . dressed in a t - shirt and shorts , @entity83 said that he had evacuated ahead of @entity37 . he told @entity78 that he 'd stayed this time because " i did n't think it would happen again .

" about 35 miles northeast in @entity111 , along the shores of @entity109 , @entity110 said that he came across at least 10 vehicles flooded and " unsalvageable " while surveying the city friday . @entity114 had also gotten into several homes , especially those without crawl spaces or , like @entity110 's , not built up on stilts . ironically , some of the luckiest residents were those who 'd had their homes destroyed by or after @entity37 -- because their rebuilt homes were elevated or otherwise protected , per new requirements to qualify for insurance . businesses along one strip in @entity111 , a community of about 27,000 people , were soaked in an inch or more of water , even though they are about five miles from the lakefront .

@placeholder says @entity3 is running out of oil , lacks other economic strengths	@entity227	( @entity0 ) -- in recent days , international attention has refocused on the rapidly deteriorating security situation in @entity3 . the claim of responsibility for the attack on @entity7 on december 25 by @entity8 has underscored the fact that @entity3 's problems will not stay in @entity3 . in the absence of immediate and sustained attention by the international community , @entity3 may be overwhelmed by a unique convergence of crises . while some observers feared this would come in several years , it is increasingly apparent that failure may come sooner than previously expected . @entity3 has frequently been described as a failing state -- and with good reason . civil war , terrorism , a deepening secessionist movement and economic and demographic trends threaten to overpower the @entity3 government , provide a breeding ground for terrorists and destabilize the region . @entity3 has often teetered on the brink of collapse , but it has never faced so many interconnected challenges at one time . at the heart of the country 's problems is a looming economic crisis . oil is the source of nearly 80 percent of government revenue , and it is quickly running out . there are few viable options for a sustainable post-oil economy , and @entity3 is already the poorest country in the @entity45 world with an unemployment rate conservatively estimated at 35 percent . @entity3 's pending economic collapse has been greatly accelerated by the civil war in @entity49 . government forces have been unable to decisively put down the rebels in the north of the country , and there is no military solution to the conflict . the toll in @entity49 has been severe , with extensive damage to infrastructure and an estimated 175,000 internally displaced people . the conflict 's strain on the @entity3 army has led to questions about the military 's ability to simultaneously engage in other operations , including counterterrorism . the government is spending foreign currency reserves at an alarming rate , recently estimated at more than $ 200 million per month . spending on the war will create a major budget deficit next year . every dollar spent on the civil war is a dollar not spent on addressing the underlying causes of instability in @entity3 . @entity3 also is facing a growing secessionist movement in the south of the country . when the war in @entity49 subsides , it is feared that the secessionist movement will again flare up . the government does not control the entire territory of @entity3 , and the emergence of additional areas outside of the capital of @entity89 's control will create more under - governed spaces that can be exploited by terrorist movements . for the past year , there have been growing indications that @entity8 is regrouping in @entity3 and preparing to strike @entity95 and other targets . recent counterterrorism measures in @entity97 have forced extremists to seek refuge elsewhere , and analysts have observed a steady flow of extremists relocating to @entity3 's under - governed areas . in spring 2008 , @entity8 operatives in @entity97 were encouraged by local @entity106 commanders to escape to @entity3 , and by january 2009 , the @entity97 and @entity108 affiliates merged . a video announcing the establishment of @entity8 featured two @entity97 previously released from the @entity112 military detention center at @entity113 , @entity114 -- both assumed leadership positions in the newly formed organization . @entity118 subsequently surrendered to @entity97 authorities and @entity120 reportedly escaped a recent counterterrorism strike that preceded the @entity123 bombing . the emergence of the regional @entity8 group marks a major deterioration of security in @entity3 . as recent events have highlighted , @entity3 is becoming a base for @entity8 to mount operations not only inside the country but also across the @entity132 and internationally . in august 2009 , @entity8 nearly assassinated prince @entity133 , the @entity97 counterterrorism chief , in an attack that was eerily similar to the @entity123 bomb attack . following the attack on @entity137 , it boasted of its new bomb technology and threatened to use its new ' undetectable substance ' again . and in mid-october , several @entity97 were killed trying to cross into @entity97 , including the brother of deputy commander @entity120 . according to local press reports , the two were attempting to smuggle several suicide vests into @entity97 . @entity8 was allegedly bolstered by the relocation of @entity8 operatives from @entity146 and @entity147 this summer . media reports quoted intelligence sources saying that fighters fleeing from @entity151 were seeking safe havens in @entity3 and @entity153 . any single event -- or more likely a confluence of worst - case events beyond the ability of the @entity3 government to control -- could lead to a further erosion of central government authority in @entity3 and destabilization of the region . as the central government 's authority and legitimacy continue to deteriorate , there will be more opportunities for extremists directed or inspired by @entity8 to regroup , organize , train and launch operations against @entity112 and allied targets throughout the @entity173 region and globally . military operations to kill or capture @entity8 operatives will likely increase in 2010 . these actions carry risks . publicly acknowledged @entity112 involvement in counterterrorism operations in @entity3 would be deeply unpopular in the country , likely undermine the legitimacy of the @entity3 government and feed into the grievances that help fuel @entity8 militancy . development assistance is one of the most effective tools available to address the interconnected long - term challenges facing @entity3 . but , @entity112 aid is disproportionately small considering the magnitude of the problems facing the country and @entity3 's strategic importance to the @entity112 . in addition to the reported $ 70 million of military and security assistance , the @entity112 recently announced $ 121 million in development aid over the next three years , a significant increase from previous years and a vital step in the right direction . still , the amount pales in comparison to the $ 1.5 billion allotted to @entity146 in the next year alone . this disparity persists even as @entity112 officials increasingly cite @entity3 as a terrorism and security priority second only to @entity147 and @entity146 . no perfect solutions exist for @entity3 's problems today , and none of its many pressing challenges can be fully averted . however , steps can be taken to lessen their impact . the @entity112 has a stake in helping @entity3 deal with its problems , and the cost of inaction would be too great . failure to act now would lead to fewer and even worse options in the future . as one administration official recently said to me , " we 've seen this movie before , and we know how it ends . " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .	@entity97:Saudi Arabia	@entity114:Cuba	@entity113:Guantanamo Bay	@entity112:United States	@entity153:Somalia	@entity89:Sanaa	@entity137:Prince Mohammed	@entity151:South Asia	@entity133:Mohammed bin Nayef	@entity118:Mohammed al-Awfi	@entity3:Yemen	@entity173:Gulf	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Northwest flight 253	@entity8:al Qaeda	@entity132:Arabian Peninsula	@entity106:Saudi al Qaeda	@entity108:Yemeni al Qaeda	@entity95:Western	@entity123:Christmas Day Northwest	@entity120:Said al-Shihri	@entity146:Pakistan	@entity147:Afghanistan	@entity227:Boucek	@entity45:Arab	@entity49:Saada
@entity2 , @placeholder and @entity61 have all won recent majors using belly putter	@entity56	( @entity0 ) -- the coach of four - time major winner @entity2 has urged golf 's governing bodies to come to a quick decision on the proposed banning of anchored putting . @entity8 's rulemakers @entity9 ( @entity9 ) and the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , which governs the game in the @entity12 and @entity13 , announced in november they intend to ban the method of putting by which a club is anchored to a part of the body by 2016 . the decision has been backed by the @entity19 , but @entity20 , commissioner of the lucrative @entity12 - based @entity21 , opposes the rule change which would essentially outlaw the controversial " belly putter " . @entity2 is one of a clutch of recent major winners who favor using the belly putter -- three of the last five majors have been won by a player using the technique . @entity2 ' coach @entity30 has called for a solution to be found soon in order to protect the integrity of the game . " they have to make a decision quickly , " @entity30 told @entity0 's @entity8 . " @entity37 , who 's easily the best putter on the planet , got up and said to @entity20 , ' you 've got to make a decision now . " if we let this thing continue for three or four more years the guys that are still using the long putter are still going to be winning golf tournaments and then do we put a asterisk , is there a stigma attached to that . " the longer this keeps going and they still ca n't find a decision , a guy like @entity56 , does he practice and waste time away from his game to try and do something or does he just continue to do what he is really good at ? " @entity56 and fellow @entity12 @entity61 both used the anchored putting technique to win the @entity63 in 2011 and 2012 respectively . @entity30 joined @entity20 in questioning whether the method offered players an advantage over more conventional putting techniques . " none of the best putters in the world use a belly putter and i know from talking to guys like @entity2 , like @entity56 and @entity61 , i think they do feel a little bit that there 's a target on their back , " added @entity30 . " i think it is going to be very hard to quantify with data an advantage that a belly putter gives players . " the @entity21 and the @entity19 and golf at a professional level is a sport absolutely , but it is also a business . " for me what @entity20 is trying to do is say to the governing bodies , this is just my opinion , that if you 're going to make decisions that affect the professional game you have to involve the professional game . " former world no. 1 @entity96 , who uses a traditional putter , also wants to see the issue put to bed . " i 'm a little tired of it , " 2010 @entity63 winner @entity96 told @entity0 . " everybody should make a decision and we move on . all the speculation now is a little bit too much . " the @entity21 , the @entity9 , the @entity19 , they should sit down and make a decision together . " @entity108 , of @entity110 newspaper @entity109 , suggests the reintroduction of golf at the 2016 @entity113 means anchored putting will be banned , despite @entity12 resistance . " i think it 's clear where this is going , " said @entity108 . " you ca n't get this far and then say , ' ok , as you were . ' the putter is going to be banned . " the @entity113 is coming up , you ca n't have an anchored putter at the @entity113 . it 's as simple as that . " according to @entity124 of @entity125 , the @entity21 will have to back down in order to avoid a division within the sport . " you ca n't have different rules , " @entity124 said . " they 're going to have to fall in line with whatever the @entity10 and @entity9 do . " it would be chaotic if the @entity21 wrote their own rule on this , which they 've never done . it would be a major departure .

@entity275 ' " @placeholder " airs thursday , december 11 , at 9p et	@entity274	( @entity1 ) imagine spending your entire career searching for something buried somewhere within the @entity5 -- and then when you miraculously find it , the federal government seizes your discovery . that 's the predicament paleontologist @entity8 found himself in after he and his team unearthed a nearly complete @entity11 skeleton in 1990 , preserved for some 67 million years in what is now the state of @entity14 . it is the most intact @entity11 skeleton ever found . @entity8 and his team had permission from the rancher , @entity18 , to dig on his property . before they had fully unearthed the fossil and realized its significance , they paid @entity18 $ 5,000 for the discovery . " that was the most that any landowner had ever gotten ( for a dinosaur fossil in the ground ) , " @entity8 said . " we shook hands and he ( @entity18 ) was pretty excited about seeing it set up in the museum . " @entity8 and his team from the @entity35 in @entity14 had planned to showcase their discovery at the institute . but that never happened and @entity8 would soon find himself in the middle of a protracted legal battle that would result in him serving time in federal prison . flat tire leads to fossil find maybe if the 1975 @entity45 had n't gotten a flat tire . maybe if @entity47 had n't been so impatient -- or if she had n't gotten lost in the fog , the @entity11 skeleton would still be in that craggy @entity14 rockface . on the morning of august 12 , 1990 , the @entity52 fossil hunter team 's @entity45 broke down so @entity47 decided to venture out on her own on @entity18 ' ranch where the team had spent weeks searching for fossils . that foggy morning , she walked right into the discovery of a lifetime . " anybody who had any idea what a fossil versus a rock ( looked like ) would have seen it , " @entity47 said . " there ( were ) a lot of broken bones dribbling down ( and ) about 8 feet up the side of the cliff , there were three articulated vertebrae and a couple of other pieces of bone sticking out . " @entity47 immediately showed one of the vertebrae to her colleagues . amazed , @entity8 said he and the team " literally ran back to the site . " they nicknamed the @entity11 " @entity47 " after @entity47 , and spent the next few weeks carefully unearthing the fossilized skeleton after paying @entity18 for the find . the bones , still encased in plaster and earth , were transferred to the @entity35 where they began the long , arduous process of separating and preparing them for display -- a dream of @entity8 and his brother , @entity89 , also a member of his team . " ever since we created that little museum on our parents ' ranch , it 's always been our dream to have a museum here in @entity100 ( @entity14 ) , " @entity8 said , referring to the @entity35 . " and finding @entity47 , the @entity11 -- here 's the anchor for the museum . " more than 80 % of the skeleton was recovered -- making " @entity47 " the most complete and largest @entity11 ever discovered . and the scientific impact was huge : one of the most interesting discoveries , according to @entity8 , was that the injuries to the bones indicated that @entity47 had died after being attacked by another @entity11 . @entity8 said he and the entire town hoped that a public display of @entity47 would " put @entity100 on the map . " their excitement soon turned to outrage as federal agents arrived on the doorstep of the @entity35 . whose fossil is it ? the morning of may 12 , 1992 , the @entity35 paleontology team was still riding high . they had just succeeded in separating the @entity11 's pelvis from its skull -- a process that took more than a year and , if done incorrectly , could have damaged the prized skull . " taking that hip off of @entity47 's skull was critical . ... you do n't have a second chance , " said paleontologist @entity126 . " one little movement ( and ) it could be cracking it all the way through inside . " around 7 that morning , @entity134 agents and the @entity135 arrived at the institute and seized @entity47 , the records related to the @entity11 and other documents from the @entity35 . " i go down to the office and there 's two @entity134 agents sitting there ( saying ) ' you 've stolen this from federal land and we 're coming here to seize this , ' " @entity8 said . it took days for the federal agents to load up the fossil and during that time , @entity100 residents showed up to protest which attracted the attention of the national media . the " entire town of @entity100 ... was in mourning when they took that dinosaur away , " said @entity35 's office manager @entity156 . even though the team had gotten permission and paid the landowner for the fossil find , @entity18 -- who died in 2011 -- had apparently changed his claim and said the fossil belonged to him , said @entity167 , author of " @entity168 " and @entity8 's ex-wife . in addition , it turned out @entity18 ' private ranch was part of @entity174 , which further complicated who owned @entity47 . on top of that , five years before @entity47 's discovery , the @entity176 ( @entity176 ) had begun to investigate the @entity35 for illegally collecting fossils on public lands , said @entity176 senior geologist @entity182 . " there was a civil matter that dealt with the ownership of @entity47 ... ( and ) there was a separate , criminal investigation that had very little to do with @entity47 , " @entity182 told @entity1 . " i think ... the dinosaur overshadowed a lot of that discussion and ... created confusion . " navigating the tricky land laws were central to the federal case against the @entity35 . for 18 months , @entity47 remained locked up as the federal government gathered enough evidence to charge @entity8 and the other members of the institute -- giving immunity deals to several employees and friends of the institute in exchange for their testimony . @entity47 was one of those given immunity -- but she said she had nothing incriminating to say because " they did n't do anything wrong . " the @entity209 and the @entity176 conducted the bulk of the federal investigation against @entity8 and the @entity35 . @entity212 , the lead investigator for the @entity209 , said the evidence recovered at the institute was overwhelming . " there were so many bones , so many animals , so many invertebrates that were taken off of public lands , taken internationally , sold internationally . ... there was way more than we ever could have investigated , " @entity212 said . he stressed that @entity47 " was n't ... what was being looked at as far as potential criminal violations . " @entity8 and his colleagues have denied taking fossils off of public lands . in november 1993 , a federal grand jury returned a 39 - count indictment containing 153 charges against @entity8 and five others linked to the @entity35 , including @entity126 and @entity8 's brother , @entity89 . the 153 charges in the indictment included fossil theft , money laundering , and false statements to government agencies . none of the charges were directly related to @entity47 . in fact , during the trial , the court instructed both sides and all witnesses to avoid discussing the @entity11 . in the end , @entity18 made $ 7.6 million from the eventual auction of @entity47 , who was put on display at @entity249 's @entity248 -- and @entity8 served 18 months in federal prison for customs violations unrelated to the @entity11 . after @entity47 today , @entity8 still runs the @entity252 in @entity100 , @entity14 , where his enthusiasm for @entity254 has n't abated . he and his team have found a total of 10 partial @entity11 skeletons . despite everything that happened to him and his team , @entity8 says he 's glad that @entity47 is on public display . he even went to the dinosaur 's 2000 unveiling in @entity249 as a guest of @entity47 's . he has n't given up on his dream of returning @entity47 " in some form " to @entity100 : he 's asking the @entity248 for a full research cast of the @entity11 " i think it 's probably the second best place she could have been , " he said , referring to @entity249 .

@placeholder is a graduate from the @entity154 before turning professional at 19	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- the little - known @entity1 shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on sunday with a runaway seven - shot victory at the @entity6 at @entity7 . not bad for a farm boy who failed to make the cut in seven of his previous eight major championships . @entity1 joins @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 as @entity15 winners of the famous @entity16 . despite many having difficulty pronouncing his name , few will forget @entity21 's dazzling performance at @entity7 . the win really is a fairytale story for the 27 - year - old who lives on a farm in @entity26 , @entity15 , next door to his parents . @entity1 , who also has a home in @entity31 , @entity32 , was born in @entity33 , @entity15 . his father was a farmer by trade yet all young @entity1 wanted to do growing up was play golf and tennis . @entity1 decided to ditch the tennis racket for good in favor of the club when he was 10 before spending three years at the @entity13 & @entity41 during his teenage years . @entity1 seals runaway @entity43 @entity6 victory @entity1 is eternally grateful to the foundation , which was set up by @entity13 in 1999 to help nurture @entity15 's next generation of star golfers . it gave him financial support and coaching on the course his family could never offer their son . " it was unbelievable what he ( @entity13 ) did for me , " @entity1 told the official @entity43 @entity6 website . " he is such a good mentor and probably without him , those three years in his foundation , i would n't have been here . " it was not long before the future @entity43 @entity6 champion started tasting success after teaming up with compatriot @entity65 to win his first title at the @entity67 in 2000 . the teenager then claimed six amateur titles including the @entity71 title in 2002 before turning professional at 19 in the same year . but despite hitting a 57 during a practice round on the par - 72 @entity76 course , along with gaining his @entity78 card in 2003 , his early performances in the paid ranks were less impressive . he did manage to record the first of his eight professional wins on home soil at the 2004 @entity83 . but joy was quickly turned into despair as " @entity86 " -- as he is fondly known to his friends due to his gap - tooth smile -- failed to qualify for his first @entity6 at @entity7 in 2005 . the season ended in disappointment as @entity1 finished 139th on the money list forcing him to return to qualifying school to regain his @entity78 card . ' @entity86 ' takes charge at @entity7 the @entity15 responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit , winning three titles on the @entity97 including the @entity99 pga championship . however , @entity1 's stop - start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the masters , the @entity6 and the @entity104 in 2009 . but 2010 is without doubt his most successful and memorable year on and off the course to date . first , @entity1 became a father after his wife @entity108 gave birth to their baby daughter @entity110 . then in march he finally won his first @entity78 event at the @entity113 in @entity114 beating @entity32 's @entity115 and @entity116 of @entity117 , who were tied second by three strokes . a victory of sorts in @entity121 was next , as the @entity15 won the @entity122 at the @entity123 in april , but he missed the cut in the tournament proper at @entity126 . he also missed the weekend action in the @entity128 at @entity129 so the signs were not promising as he traveled to the east coast of @entity117 for the third major of the season . having missed the cut at the @entity6 in 2004 , 2006 and 2009 , few , if any , envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on sunday . yet @entity1 left @entity138 , @entity139 and the world number one @entity141 in his wake , with his final round of one - under - par 71 giving him a 16 - under total of 272 and his only major title so far .	@entity21:Lodewicus Theodorus " Louis " Oosthuizen	@entity26:Gourits River	@entity99:Telkcom	@entity15:South Africa	@entity117:Scotland	@entity97:Sunshine Tour	@entity115:Richard Finch	@entity83:Vodacom Origins of Golf Tour	@entity113:Open de Andalucia	@entity138:Paul Casey	@entity86:Shrek	@entity110:Jana	@entity154:Ernie Els Foundation	@entity1:Oosthuizen	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:St. Andrews	@entity6:British Open	@entity78:European Tour	@entity76:Mossel Bay Golf Club	@entity71:Irish Amateur Open Stroke Play	@entity31:Manchester	@entity16:Claret Jug	@entity33:Mossel Bay	@entity32:England	@entity13:Ernie Els	@entity12:Gary Player	@entity11:Bobby Locke	@entity67:World Junior Team Championships	@entity104:PGA Championship	@entity128:U.S. Open	@entity129:Pebble Beach	@entity108:Nel-Marie	@entity122:Par 3 Contest	@entity123:2010 Masters	@entity121:America	@entity141:Tiger Woods	@entity116:Peter Whiteford	@entity126:Augusta	@entity114:Spain	@entity41:Fancourt Foundation	@entity43:British	@entity139:Lee Westwood	@entity65:Charl Schwartzel
@entity12 @entity20 champion beats @placeholder 's @entity5 6 - 2 in a friendly in the @entity52 city	@entity0	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- for at least 10 minutes , it looked as if it could have been a fairytale night for the home side . within only the first few minutes , @entity0 's league winner @entity5 found itself in the jarringly unfamiliar position of being a goal to the good against star - studded @entity12 football champion @entity10 . natural order reasserted itself shortly after , however , with @entity10 winger @entity15 scoring a well - taken goal as the crowd erupted . it was the first of six for the @entity20 side , including a hat - trick for star striker @entity22 . as the wisdom of arduous preseason tours is being questioned in some quarters , especially as exhausted players return from the @entity27 , @entity10 was in bullish form here in @entity0 , and its growing popularity in evidence . indeed , wading through the crowds before kickoff , it was almost impossible to tell which team held home advantage in tuesday 's match , with @entity10 replica shirts -- mostly sporting the number 10 and @entity22 's name splayed across the back -- easily outnumbering any other sartorial choices .

" regular trips the @entity52 preseason tour has become an annual ritual for many of @entity56 's top teams , although this year many @entity58 high - flyers , having won over @entity52 fans through years of visits , are instead turning their attention to that other great untapped market , the @entity63 . the popularity of @entity58 teams in @entity0 , as in so many other @entity52 markets , far outstrips that of their @entity69 neighbors , even @entity72 winner @entity70 and fellow @entity74 giant @entity73 , as well as @entity77 titleholder @entity75 . " it 's exciting to see these matches live ( in the stadium ) , " says 16 - year - old @entity78 , who is wearing a @entity10 replica shirt with @entity81 's name on the back , a throwback to when the @entity58 superstar played half a season in the @entity12 capital . " i 'd also come and watch if it was @entity91 or @entity92 , though .

" since the @entity12 @entity20 decided to come to @entity52 to play the @entity117 it makes sense to come earlier , " he says . " to come here and to meet with our partners and sponsors .

" it was always ... a good opportunity for the squad to come to @entity52 , especially @entity0 , ahead of the @entity174 ( @entity117 ) in @entity118 so it was all planned , there is no problem at at , " the @entity170 winner told @entity1 . he also said that the team did n't need to stoop to scrapping for the allegiance of fans in @entity52 . " without any ( arrogance ) , @entity10 is one of the greatest football teams in @entity56 , so it 's already ( a jewel ) of the football world ... there 's nothing to pretend , nothing to compete . " visiting fans while other top managers bemoan the travel time and physical demands that these tours put on their squads , @entity10 is a relative newcomer to the @entity52 market and welcomes the opportunity to meet potential devotees -- and convert some undecideds . " it 's part of being a great football club , " says @entity101 . " you have to come and see your fans , otherwise you can not expand and you can not compete .

@placeholder 's first show since leaving @entity3 airs on monday night	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- nearly five months after signing off from @entity3 , left - wing news personality @entity1 returned to the airwaves monday with the relaunch of his signature " countdown " show on @entity8 . while known for generally opposing republicans and supporting @entity11 , @entity1 signaled that both parties would be targets in his " @entity14 , " a segment that was also part of his previous show . " the nation is losing its independence through the malfeasance of one party and the timidity of the other , " he said , according to the show 's blog . still , the early take from the inaugural show suggested it would lean left , as evidenced by one segment labeled " inside the @entity29 . " guests included liberal documentary filmmaker @entity31 , @entity33 blogger @entity32 and @entity34 , a former @entity35 counsel to president @entity36 and now a conservative critic . @entity1 said he will be a frequent contributor to the show . @entity1 abruptly left @entity3 in late january after eight years at the news network . in his time there , the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at @entity47 and elsewhere , though he also faced criticism and publicly aired his frustrations with @entity51 's management . he signed a deal weeks later with @entity8 , a company founded in 2005 by former vice president @entity53 and @entity54 . besides hosting and producing his new prime time nightly news and commentary show , @entity1 is also @entity8 's chief news officer and has an equity stake in the company . the 52 - year - old had been suspended from @entity3 for two days in november 2010 after the news website @entity61 revealed he had made donations to three @entity11 . that includes $ 2,400 -- the maximum amount that can be given by an individual -- given to the campaign of @entity68 rep. @entity67 , an @entity70 @entity69 who was seriously wounded in a mass shooting in @entity72 . he also donated to the campaigns of @entity76 candidate @entity75 of @entity77 and @entity68 rep. @entity78 of @entity70 . @entity75 lost his bid , while @entity78 and @entity67 won . @entity1 's alliance with current tv is another major transition for a man who , before his time with @entity3 , spent 13 years with the sports network @entity86 . current tv can be seen in more than 75 million households worldwide .	@entity29:Republican Cult	@entity32:Markos Moulitsas	@entity86:ESPN	@entity3:MSNBC	@entity1:Olbermann	@entity0:CNN	@entity8:Current Media	@entity53:Al Gore	@entity51:NBC	@entity78:Grijalva	@entity54:Joel Hyatt	@entity75:Conway	@entity77:Kentucky	@entity76:Senate	@entity70:Arizona	@entity72:Tucson	@entity31:Michael Moore	@entity33:Daily Kos	@entity14:Special Comment	@entity35:White House	@entity34:John Dean	@entity11:Democrats	@entity36:Richard Nixon	@entity93:ex-Nixon	@entity47:Fox News	@entity68:U.S.	@entity69:Democrat	@entity67:Giffords	@entity61:Politico
@entity1 officials and @entity11 watchdog agency will meet on december 13 in @placeholder	@entity104	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has made a significant advancement in its nuclear program with the completion of its underground uranium enrichment facility near the holy city of @entity8 , according to a report released friday by a @entity11 watchdog group . the @entity13 report stated @entity1 has now installed all of the nearly 2,800 centrifuges it will use to enrich uranium at the @entity18 plant , but not all the centrifuges are operational . the @entity13 also says @entity1 has increased its stockpile of both 5 % and 20 % enriched uranium , which can more readily be converted to a weapons grade level . @entity1 maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , but the @entity24 , @entity25 and other nations contend @entity1 seeks to build nuclear weapons . the @entity18 facility was built into the side of a mountain , making it less vulnerable to attack . @entity25 has made it clear that completion of the plant could make it difficult to stop @entity1 if it decides to go ahead and build nuclear explosives . @entity1 still not cooperating with nuclear inspectors in august , the agency reported that @entity1 had stepped up its production of high - grade enriched uranium and had relandscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a @entity11 inquiry into its nuclear program . friday 's report said @entity1 still has n't allowed the agency access to the military site , called @entity50 . the agency has been seeking access since january . the new report repeated the conclusion reached in august that " extensive activities " at the @entity50 site are certain to have " seriously undermined " the agency 's verification process . those activities include " significant ground scraping and landscaping " with new dirt roads , the august report said . many @entity64 diplomats and nuclear experts believe the @entity50 site has been secretly used to test high - explosive nuclear triggers , an essential step toward achieving a weapons capability . @entity1 denies that @entity50 has any role in its nuclear program . " the agency reiterates its request that @entity1 , without further delay , provide both access to that location and substantive answers to the agency 's detailed questions regarding the @entity50 site , " friday 's report said . " given the nature and extent of credible information available , the agency continues to consider it essential for @entity1 to engage with the agency without further delay on the substance of the agency 's concerns , " the report said . the @entity13 once again stated that @entity1 is not cooperating sufficiently with the agency for it to conclude that the country is conducting " peaceful activities . " the agency said that despite its effort to step up talks with @entity1 , the nation has offered no " concrete results . " the agency 's director general is , in turn , " unable to report any progress on clarifying issues relating to possible military dimensions to @entity1 's nuclear programme , " the report said . @entity13 and @entity1 officials have scheduled a december 13 meeting in @entity104 to address the ongoing issues in the country 's nuclear program , the report said . putting a price on war with @entity1 @entity0 's @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .	@entity1:Iranian	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:IAEA	@entity24:United States	@entity11:U.N.	@entity25:Israel	@entity8:Qom	@entity18:Fordow	@entity50:Parchin	@entity104:Tehran	@entity112:Tim Lister	@entity111:Ashley Fantz	@entity110:Matthew Chance	@entity64:Western
@entity190 : @entity1 defied the world , and there is not much the @placeholder can do	@entity43	( @entity0 ) -- once again , @entity1 has violated an important international agreement by launching a long - range missile . and like many times before , there is not much @entity5 or anyone else can do about it . the brazen defiance of the @entity1 regime is stunning . it 's a performance that carries a strong message for the @entity12 and regimes that are contemplating the possibility of starting nuclear programs of their own . it may be tempting to dismiss the importance of the launch since the rocket failed to go into orbit and disintegrated after liftoff . but @entity1 succeeded in defying the world and managed to carry out an important test of its missile program . those who are paying attention to the unfolding drama in the @entity29 include the leaders of @entity31 and those trying to stop @entity31 's nuclear ambition . @entity35 's decision comes at a time when the @entity12 is preparing for new talks with @entity31 . at the end of february , @entity1 made an agreement with @entity5 to stop all missile tests and uranium enrichment in exchange for the @entity43 to deliver 240,000 tons of food . ( while the regime can not feed its people , the budget for new launching pads , rockets and a huge military has not run out . ) now @entity35 has broken its word . it is claiming that launching a satellite into space is not a military test , so it does not violate the international agreement ; rather , the event was meant to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder and " eternal president , " @entity62 . but that explanation persuades no one . the @entity43 and its allies warned @entity1 to stop the launch , saying plainly , " do n't do it . " president @entity70 , in a thinly veiled message to @entity35 and also to @entity69 , warned that " treaties are binding . rules will be enforced . and violations will have consequences . " it 's not clear what those consequences might be . the @entity43 says it will not deliver the food aid agreed to in february , but that further punishes a population living in misery . the true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons , as @entity1 has done , are becoming increasingly clear . the @entity1 dictatorship may just be the most brutal regime on earth , imprisoning , starving and isolating its people . despite its self - acknowledged " responsibility to protect " victims of state power , the rest of the world tiptoes around the atrocities , afraid to provoke the unpredictable regime because it has a nuclear arsenal . what the latest missile launch may be is a propaganda campaign , a show of force to consolidate power by @entity101 , who took power in december after the death of his father , @entity104 . the @entity105 have ruled @entity1 since its founding after @entity107 since @entity1 tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006 , the country has become more of a threat to the region and the world . it has used extortion , manipulation and intimidation against its neighbors and against the @entity43 . it has killed , kidnapped and terrorized those in neighboring countries . and it has become a provider of nuclear technology to dangerous regimes . in may 2010 , it fired a torpedo that sank a @entity124 submarine , killing 46 sailors . @entity124 , a strong ally of the @entity43 , responded with a trade embargo . six month later , the residents of the small @entity124 island of @entity130 fled in terror as the @entity132 fired 130 artillery shells . the attack killed no one but caused widespread panic . @entity1 's nuclear and missile tests have also put @entity139 on edge more than once . today , @entity139 seems like it is preparing for war as it awaits the latest missile launch . and according to a leaked report from the @entity144 , @entity1 has become a supplier to the nuclear programs of @entity31 , @entity147 and @entity148 . in 2008 , videos of @entity1 workers inside a mysterious plant in @entity147 added to suspicions and helped convince @entity153 that @entity147 was building a nuclear reactor to produce weapons - grade plutonium . the reactor was later destroyed by @entity153 . because @entity1 obtained nuclear weapons , its erratic behavior and appalling actions have become almost impossible to stop . that reality has come with a terrible cost to the suffering people of its people and with a price tag whose final tally in world peace is still unknown . for a country such as @entity31 , the impunity that has followed @entity1 's success on the nuclear pathway is an incentive not to give up its own nuclear program . for the rest of the world , it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere , but especially in the @entity180 , the most unstable region on earth . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .	@entity29:Korean Peninsula	@entity139:Japan	@entity153:Israel	@entity130:Yeonpyeong	@entity132:North	@entity1:North Korea	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Washington	@entity198:Ghitis	@entity190:Frida Ghitis	@entity70:Barack Obama	@entity31:Iran	@entity35:Pyongyang	@entity12:West	@entity69:Tehran	@entity101:Kim Jong Un	@entity104:Kim Jong Il	@entity105:Kims	@entity107:World War II.	@entity124:South Korean	@entity144:United Nations	@entity147:Syria	@entity180:Middle East	@entity148:Burma	@entity185:Frida Ghitis	@entity43:U.S.	@entity62:Kim Il Sung
former prime minister tells @placeholder seems stuck on path to sectarian war	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- even in the darkest , deadliest days of @entity1 's war , you 'd find people still hopeful it would all work out . that the killings would stop , the bad guys would be routed and a stability of some sort would return . that the @entity11 would leave with their humvees and their private security companies and the country would -- perhaps -- get on with the freedom the @entity11 promised upon @entity17 's removal . prime minister @entity18 promised as much , and pledged an inclusive system for all . power - sharing politics and making all @entity22 -- sunni , @entity23 , @entity24 -- feel they shared national values . now , there a plenty of @entity22 who believe he had his fingers crossed when he said such things . just over two years ago , i watched as the last of 110 or so @entity11 military vehicles crossed the border from @entity1 and into @entity35 -- the same border crossing i 'd gone through in at the start of the war in 2003 with a @entity40 convoy headed to the @entity22 capital . i 've had nearly a dozen trips in between and now here i am , back in @entity0 . the city feels much the same as it did during some of those other trips -- and that 's not a good thing . actually , it feels worse . read more : are things worse than ever in @entity1 ? the @entity11 departure may have ended the war for @entity11 , but for @entity22 , the violence , the bombs , the shootings and the torrents of blood barely skipped a beat . a lull here and there , periods of what might ( for @entity1 ) pass for stability , but really , the deaths never stopped . more than 8,000 people were killed here last year , mostly innocent civilians , according to the @entity68 the feeling in @entity0 today is one of dread -- dreading the next car bomb or suicide attack or assassination . the city is n't lacking a security presence -- it is awash in it . two years ago there were checkpoints , but nowhere near the number we 've seen these past days , nor were those manning those checkpoints as , let 's say , fastidious as they are now . just moving around the city is an exercise in moving from one checkpoint to the next , each manned by young men who themselves , one imagines , fear the next car could be the last one they ever inspect . getting around the city is as difficult as ever . traffic jams are a way of life here , but they seem worse because of the security presence . check points and police posts are everywhere , but they ca n't stop every attack -- eight bombs have gone off in @entity0 in the past two days as i write this . read more : 26 killed in bombings in northern @entity1 people have to get on with life , and do the best they can . one target of the terrorists is marketplaces , where locals put their lives on the line just to shop for dinner . many buildings damaged during the war sit unrepaired , but there are signs of construction too . there 's even a mall of sorts being built not far from where we 're staying . many parts of the city retain a tattered feel , like it 's a tired city , weary of the tribulations of the last decade . public services are a problem -- electricity can still be patchy , there 's no shortage of roads needing repair , unemployment is high , sewage systems are in desperate need of repair . @entity1 's to - do list , despite growing oil revenues , is a long one . in the " bad old days " of , say , 2005 - 2007 , barely a day went by when , sitting in our bureau , we would not hear a boom or gunshots , some dulled by distance , others rattling our windows . one day , a stray bullet pierced one of those windows . those booms are back . plenty has been reported about the violence in @entity155 and @entity156 and the resurgence of @entity158 linked radicals , but the killing is widespread -- from @entity161 in the north to @entity0 to the south of the country . dr. @entity165 was @entity1 's first @entity166 head of government , serving as interim prime minister in 2004 and 2005 . tough as nails , but a committed secularist , he looks at his country today with more than a dose of pessimism . " unfortunately the country is moving on a sectarian road now , " he tells me as we sit in his office , hidden behind blast walls and protected by government and private security . " it was very dangerous to start with , and i warned leaders in the region . ( now ) @entity1 has started a civil war -- it has n't reached the point of no return , but if it does then the whole region will burn up . " he points the finger of blame in many directions , from @entity191 to the @entity11 to @entity192 , but mainly at the man who now holds his old job -- prime minister @entity18 . " he does n't believe in power sharing , he does n't believe in reconciliation , " @entity165 says . " he promised to do these things once he became prime minister , but in effect he talks against this -- accusing everyone else of being a terrorist , or corrupt , or extremist and so on . " authoritarian regimes do n't work in this country -- we tried this before and it did n't work . no one sect can rule , no one party can rule , no one man can rule -- we want a democratic country but this is not , unfortunately , what this government wants .

" they can support @entity18 -- that 's up to them , " he says . " but they should clarify to him that their support is conditional on inclusivity of the political process and respecting the constitution and respecting human rights . " i suggest to him that the @entity11 have of late been applying some of that pressure , but he disagrees . " of course the @entity11 are not doing this , " he says . " i do n't know if they are pushing , frankly speaking -- i do believe they may pay lip service , but they do n't fully use the influence they have as friends of mr. @entity18 . " over the course of more than a dozen trips to @entity1 since the war began , i 've always encountered angry @entity22 -- angry at the @entity11 troops , angry at the lack of services , angry at the insurgents and the sectarian bloodletting . but on this visit , i 've found a hardening of attitudes right down the sectarian line -- shias who feel @entity224 are @entity158 - supporting extremists , and @entity224 who tell terrible tales of persecution , exclusion and fear of being detained based on their religion alone . the moderates who wish to embrace their fellow @entity22 , regardless of sect , are becoming harder to find .	@entity22:Iraqi	@entity23:Shia Muslim	@entity24:Christian	@entity158:al Qaeda	@entity156:Fallujah	@entity155:Ramadi	@entity232:Anbar	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:CNN Iraq	@entity0:Baghdad	@entity192:Iran	@entity191:Syria	@entity17:Saddam Hussein	@entity35:Kuwait	@entity11:American	@entity18:al-Maliki	@entity161:Mosul	@entity166:post-Saddam	@entity224:Sunnis	@entity165:Allawi	@entity283:Holmes	@entity40:U.S. Marine	@entity68:U.N.
@entity0 criticizes ' 08 @placeholder quote about @entity16 plant	@entity2	@entity0 on wednesday night told a story about then - presidential candidate @entity2 telling automotive workers that government can help keep their plant going -- an account that @entity0 reportedly got wrong previously . did the @entity8 congressman get it right as he accepted the @entity11 nomination for vice president at the @entity13 ? @entity0 discussed @entity2 's february 2008 speech at the @entity16 plant in @entity17 , @entity8 -- a plant that eventually closed . according to @entity0 , @entity2 had said that " if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years . " fact check : @entity26 , @entity2 and debt the statement : " when he talked about change , many people liked the sound of it , especially in @entity17 , where we were about to lose a major factory . a lot of guys i went to high school with worked at that @entity16 plant . right there at that plant , candidate @entity2 said : ' i believe that if our government is there to support you , this plant will be here for another hundred years . ' that 's what he said in 2008 . well , as it turned out , that plant did n't last another year . it is locked up and empty to this day . " the facts : @entity52 , some context . @entity0 reportedly recalled this event incorrectly just days ago , during an august 16 speech in @entity56 . @entity0 reportedly alleged that @entity2 said he 'd " keep that plant open , " and therefore broke his promise because the plant closed . " that plant was shut down in 2009 . i remember president @entity2 visiting it when he was first running , saying he 'll keep that plant open , " @entity0 said , according to the @entity61 . " one more broken promise . " the @entity65 pointed out that @entity2 made no such promise in the february 13 , 2008 , speech , and indeed , we 've seen no account suggesting that @entity2 did . here is the quote at issue , according to an account kept by the @entity74 : " i know that @entity16 received some bad news yesterday , and i know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant . but i also know how much progress you 've made -- how many hybrids and fuel - efficient vehicles you 're churning out , " @entity2 said . " and i believe that if our government is there to support you , and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition , that this plant will be here for another hundred years . " by " bad news , " @entity2 apparently was referring to @entity16 's february 12 , 2008 , announcement that it had a $ 38.7 billion adjusted net loss for 2007 . so , back on august 16 of this year , it does appear @entity0 was wrong for saying @entity2 promised to keep it open . the @entity65 and the @entity61 went further , reporting that the plant halted production in december 2008 , and saying that @entity0 essentially was criticizing @entity2 for failing to save a plant that closed before @entity2 took office . however , while december 2008 saw the end of the vast majority of the plant 's work , the @entity61 itself has reported that the plant did n't close fully until april 2009 . here 's a timeline : june 2008 : @entity16 announces that the @entity17 plant will stop production of medium - duty trucks by the end of 2009 , and stop production of large suvs such as the @entity114 and @entity115 and the @entity114 in 2010 or sooner , depending on market demand . december 23 , 2008 : @entity118 production ends , and more than 2,000 @entity16 workers are laid off , according to the @entity61 . medium truck production continues . april 23 , 2009 : the plant 's medium - duty assembly line , which produced an @entity124 line , closes , ending vehicle production at the plant and resulting in the loss of 57 production jobs , according to the @entity61 . @entity16 then put the plant on standby , meaning it could reactivate the facility if it decides it needs to ramp up production . now , compare @entity0 's wednesday night statement with the one he gave on august 16 . on wednesday , @entity0 said nothing of @entity2 making a promise , but rather quoted him . the quote is truncated ( in @entity0 's prepared remarks released to the media , an ellipsis replaces the missing words , " give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition " ) but essentially is correct . the only thing @entity0 appears to have gotten technically wrong in wednesday 's version was saying that the plant did n't last another year . it did last another year -- more like 14 months -- if the @entity124 line and its 57 workers count . so , though @entity0 might have been incorrect in the august 16 telling , he cleaned it up for wednesday 's convention . @entity2 said what @entity0 said he said . but to fairly evaluate @entity2 's statement , at least two pieces of context -- missing from @entity0 's account -- would be useful : first , that @entity2 was n't telling this plant that he 'd save it from a pending closure . he was n't addressing a plant that he knew to be closing , because the closure announcement did n't come until four months after his speech . second , although the plant 's last bit of production stopped early in @entity2 's presidency and the plant remains closed , the closure was planned before @entity2 became president . verdict : true , but incomplete . fact check : @entity0 misleads on debt panel 's spending cut plan	@entity17:Janesville	@entity2:Obama	@entity26:Rand Paul	@entity0:Ryan	@entity13:Republican National Convention	@entity11:GOP	@entity16:GM	@entity8:Wisconsin	@entity52:First	@entity115:Suburban	@entity114:GMC Yukon	@entity56:Ohio	@entity74:Council on Foreign Relations	@entity124:Isuzu	@entity65:News	@entity61:Gazette	@entity118:SUV
kapoor teams up with @entity40 chef @placeholder , owner of two @entity44 starred " @entity47 "	@entity45	as a multi award - winning chef , bestselling author , tv channel proprietor and hugely successful syndicated show host , @entity0 is arguably the world 's most revered exponent of @entity9 cuisine . for the past 18 years he has concocted a handful of new recipes every week as the host of " @entity13 , " said to be @entity14 's most watched , and @entity16 's longest - running , cookery program . as if that were n't impressive enough , @entity0 has penned 36 cookbooks , while his website consistently attracts a hungry audience of 25 million users a month . suffice to say , the man has a distinguished rep in the venerable tradition of @entity9 cuisine . but the myriad blend of spices and stimulation of the senses that characterize his country 's culinary heritage could n't be more at odds with the restrained subtlety that dominates contemporary cooking in northern @entity35 . so it is perhaps testament to @entity0 's desire for a challenge that he chose @entity39 , @entity40 , as the location for his " @entity42 . " see more @entity43 here he would meet with , and learn from , @entity45 , head chef and proprietor of @entity47 , the two @entity44 ranked best in the world by @entity49 , where fresh ingredients and simplicity reign supreme . his mission was to synthesize the two divergent culinary traditions , and ultimately combine them into a completely original dish of his own . in his own words , @entity0 looks back over his @entity42 . @entity0 : when you 've been in the profession for as long as i have , it 's imperative to keep making new discoveries , to go beyond your particular area of expertise . and the best way to do that is to travel . so i could n't resist the chance to fly to @entity39 . with its @entity69 climate and classic @entity35 architecture , it 's a world away from @entity71 -- and the style of our cuisines are just as contrasting . the challenge is that from an @entity9 perspective taste is paramount . our savory dishes are more salty , our hot dishes are more hot , our sweet dishes are more sweet , our sour things are more sour . this is all because the use and blend of spices is very bold -- the objective is to embellish and we often have 15 to 20 contrasting herbs and spices in a single dish . but @entity45 and his @entity90 cuisine is all about simplicity . it 's all about passion and appreciation for the ingredients themselves . this philosophy was immediately apparent as soon as we journeyed out to the farms around @entity39 , where @entity45 buys most of his food directly . this emphasis on sourcing fresh ingredients , having a relationship with the producers , knowing the history of the food , is something i admire and relate to -- but not something that i 'm able to practice very often in my country . it 's an irony that the act of going to back to nature , as it were , is something that is so easy to do in @entity14 , and yet we have been going in the opposite direction . unlike a lot of the industrialized @entity117 , we 're generally much closer to our environment , but we do n't focus on it . instead , it is all becoming very commercial in nature . the food deliveries arrive at your kitchen and you wo n't know where it 's come from , how far its traveled , who the supplier is , what relationship they have with the grower and so on . this is a shame because you ca n't then guarantee the quality of the product and , on top of that , you lose the emotional connection to the food ... it becomes more like a commodity . see also : ballet star takes inspiration from @entity144 dance watching @entity45 work at @entity47 was a fascinating experience . he has so much reverence for the food and tries to keep the natural essence of his ingredients intact . so for instance , a simple carrot might be slow - roasted for hours , allowing it to soak in its own juices -- really bringing out its essential flavor . in @entity14 , we 're quick and explosive in the kitchen -- we 'd rarely cook a vegetable for longer than 15 minutes -- and the culture is about pleasing every taste sense on just one spoon , adding layers of flavor so that they all blend together . but then , of course , the individual ingredients are somewhat hidden . so , how to bring these two very different styles together in one dish ? i took the best of both . while @entity45 and i had been foraging , i 'd come across some wonderfully fresh and fragrant mustard leaves . it 's not too sharp yet it 's pungent and very mustardy ... something that i have grown up with as it 's very popular in traditional @entity9 cooking . i decided to blend this beautiful @entity178 salmon -- coating it with the mustard leaves and some lime , a little seasoning and let it cook gently . the result was a dish that had a distinctive @entity9 aroma , but with more of a @entity90 approach to the style and philosophy of preparation . the respect for the ingredient -- focusing on @entity193 , one leaf to the next -- has enabled me to return home with a new appreciation for what @entity9 cuisine still has to offer .	@entity144:Chinese	@entity16:Asia	@entity0:Kapoor	@entity13:Khana Khazana	@entity39:Copenhagen	@entity178:Norwegian	@entity9:Indian	@entity43:Fusion Journeys	@entity193:Mother Nature	@entity49:Restaurant magazine	@entity117:West	@entity45:Rene Redzepi	@entity14:India	@entity40:Danish	@entity42:Fusion Journey	@entity69:Scandinavian	@entity35:European	@entity47:Noma	@entity71:Mumbai	@entity44:Michelin	@entity90:Nordic
@placeholder 2 plans to make a record - breaking solar flight around the world	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- where better to start a record - breaking solar powered flight than the desert ? the @entity4 may be one of the most oil dependent states in the world , but next march it will be the start and finish location for @entity10 2 , a solar - powered plane that aims to circumnavigate the world using only the power of the sun. the @entity10 made headlines last year when , piloted by co-founders @entity18 and @entity19 , it took a solar - powered trip across the @entity21 . a single - seater plane fitted with 12,000 solar cells and four electrically - powered propellers , it was also the first aircraft powered by renewable energy that could fly non-stop for 24 hours . the next version , the @entity10 2 , will have 17,000 solar cells built into the wings that have a span longer than a @entity32 . the plane is expected to make the round - the - world trip in around four to five months , with some legs lasting as long as 120 hours non-stop . the first and last stop will be @entity37 . " this well - matched partnership will show @entity37 to be a center of expertise when it comes to renewable energy , " said @entity18 in an official statement . " at the same time , @entity10 will demonstrate the far - reaching applications of clean energy during the first solar - powered flight around the world .

@placeholder : unveiling of a new macbook is another sign of @entity5 's competitive advantage	@entity167	( @entity0 ) -- it 's hard to believe , but there was a time when @entity5 's computers were accused of being strictly last generation . their computers were made with clunky power pc processors , and @entity11 owners smirked at the wheezing @entity13 platform . @entity14 even famously said the whole company was so behind the times that if it were up to him , he 'd euthanize it . how things change . while the rest of the industry was counting @entity5 out , a @entity18 newly returned to @entity5 spent the early part of the last decade quietly assembling a time machine . following the @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 before it , the retina - display @entity23 announced monday at the @entity28 in @entity29 is just the latest time traveler @entity5 has sent back to us from the future . it 's a machine so shiny , so shimmering , so futuristic , so unlike anything else out there that it will take the pc - making competition at least a year to release a truly competing product . how did this even happen ? how did @entity5 assemble its time machine , and why ca n't the likes of @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 seem to catch up ? @entity5 announces high - res laptops there 's no flux capacitor involved , and although @entity5 's design team , led by @entity51 , is truly visionary , there are lots of companies with revolutionary visions of the future of computing . the difference between @entity5 and other computer makers is that @entity5 can actually build the revolutionary , magical machines it dreams up . that 's @entity5 's real mojo . they can actualize . @entity5 can say to themselves that they are going to revolutionize the professional laptop , or the smartphone , or the tablet , and then not only follow through with an enviable purity of design , source all of the parts and manufacture their product in utter secrecy , then ship the resulting en masse and sell them at unheard of profit margins . no one else can . it 's all in @entity5 's mastery of the supply chain , which is @entity82 's particular genius . his strategy is simple : when @entity5 decides to go ahead and make a revolutionary new product , it buys up literally almost all of the world 's stock of the components that define the gadget . this not only gives @entity5 massive discounts in component prices , because they are buying in extreme bulk , but it also prevents the competition from quickly releasing clones of @entity5 's iconic machines , or matching @entity5 in price without cutting corners . it happens time and time again . when @entity5 first released the @entity25 , it took the smartphone industry a year to release a phone that was even competitive , spec - for - spec , by which time @entity5 had already unveiled the @entity105 . hardware manufacturers trying to compete with @entity5 constantly discover that they can only build competing devices off of @entity5 's rejected parts , or else build new factories from the ground up to manufacture the parts they need . look at the @entity24 . it has no competition , 2√Ç¬Ω years in . last quarter , @entity5 sold almost 12 million @entity24 . comparatively , @entity5 's biggest competitor -- @entity115 -- sold 1.1 million tablets . why ? companies simply ca n't build products as good , or @entity5 's stranglehold on the manufacturing supply chain prevents them from doing so . then there 's a @entity26 . we 're starting to see competitive ultrabooks a year and a half after @entity5 unveiled the second - gen @entity26 , but that 's only after @entity126 reportedly set up a massive $ 500 million subsidy fund to help pc makers build a @entity26 clone . the new retina - display @entity23 is another such product . it 's a beast of a machine all around , but its defining feature is a high - resolution display with 220 pixels per inch , each smaller than the acuity of the human eye . it 's far and away the best display of any notebook or even desktop on the market , and you can bet that @entity5 is in control of most of the world 's supply of the panels necessary to make a machine that even comes close to competing . there 's a famous @entity151 story called " @entity152 " in which a man travels into the prehistoric past , accidentally squashes an insect underfoot and thus indelibly changes the future forever . @entity5 is that time traveler . the prehistoric insect is the competition . @entity5 crushes it underfoot with calculated purpose , and that is how the future of computing is once again forever changed . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .	@entity23:MacBook Pro	@entity26:MacBook Air	@entity24:iPads	@entity25:iPhone	@entity28:Worldwide Developers Conference	@entity29:San Francisco	@entity82:Tim Cook	@entity152:A Sound of Thunder	@entity151:Ray Bradbury	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Apple	@entity51:Jony Ive	@entity14:Michael Dell	@entity13:Mac	@entity11:Windows PC	@entity18:Steve Jobs	@entity105:iPhone 3GS	@entity126:Intel	@entity167:Brownlee	@entity115:Samsung	@entity44:Acer	@entity45:Lenovo	@entity41:Sony	@entity42:HP	@entity43:Dell

" this is paradise for them , " said @entity17 , the park 's communications director . " they will be able to play around , climb trees and eat forest food . " authorities began building the center in july 2007 but had to stop work after rebels invaded the park during the long - running civil war that raged in the @entity2 . @entity30 resumed in september as hostilities subsided . the center is expected to be ready for occupancy by march . the babies were found in 2007 when they were 2 months old , one on her slain mother and the other on the back of her brother , who was alive when the baby was found . authorities do n't know who killed the mothers , but they suspect that the perpetrators were those engaging in the park 's illegal charcoal industry , in which people cut down trees for fuel so they can cook and boil water . @entity17 said park rangers who found the babies hustled them out of the park to the city of @entity56 , where they have been living on a site with a house and trees . " if they had not been taken out of the wild , they would have died , " she said . @entity61 does n't know whether the two will be moved out of the center and into the wild when they get older . the @entity65 is a 2.5 - acre plot of forest three miles from the mountain gorilla habitat in @entity14 . @entity69 , director of @entity14 , said that along with sheltering the baby gorillas , the center offers " a unique opportunity to enable the local population to see gorillas , and provides a launch pad for the veterinary activities that are conducted throughout @entity14 .

" this morning we did a lot of work with the hard tire , so in the afternoon in these hot conditions , we worked more with the softer one to get a clearer understanding if we can run with it for race distance . " we were in and out a lot during the session trying a few different things , hoping to reduce the chatter which is still proving to be a problem . towards the end of the session we managed to improve it slightly but i think we need to make another step before the race .

" last month the 26 - year - old announced he will quit the sport at the end of this season , then finished third at the last race in @entity55 . the @entity57 rider set the fastest time on saturday of one minute 41.295 seconds -- the equivalent of 334 kmh . @entity15 , who won in @entity59 , clocked 1:41.441 and @entity3 's 2010 world champion was joined on the front row by another @entity63 rider -- @entity64 of @entity65 . @entity15 's @entity67 teammate @entity66 will lead the second row on sunday after qualifying fourth ahead of @entity57 's @entity70 and @entity72 's @entity71 . former world champion @entity73 was seventh , while the veteran @entity67 's @entity75 teammate @entity74 was ninth . @entity74 had hinted at a return to the form that won him seven world titles when he finished second in wet conditions at @entity55 , but the @entity72 was 0.88 seconds off @entity1 's pace in the @entity3 heat . veteran @entity67 @entity83 was 14th on his return to racing after a month out with a broken collarbone .

@entity163 won @placeholder in 1992 , but lost it in 1996 . @entity164 carried it twice ; @entity14 won it in 2008	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 remembers the excitement of the " change " argument in 2008 . " there was really a change then , " she said with a nostalgic smile . " people were really anxious to have a new person . " working the phones for president @entity14 again four years later , though , change has a new -- and to her troubling -- meaning . " different . it 's a little different , " she said of the then and now reaction when calling @entity20 voters in @entity1 . " it was more hype i think back in 2008 , yes . " and now ? " some people are still really excited , " @entity3 said during a brief break from her phone bank work . " others say , ' oh , i do n't know , well , i have n't made up my mind . ' " then comes the sales pitch , and the new reality of incumbency -- of 2012 . " well you say , ' he has done this , and this , ' " @entity3 told @entity2 . " and they say , ' well he promised a lot of things . ' " latinos made up 13 % of the @entity1 vote four years ago , and 61 % voted for then - sen. @entity14 as he turned @entity1 blue after @entity43 presidential victories in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 . but this time , battleground @entity1 is tougher territory . not that @entity39 have switched loyalties and plan to give significantly higher support to @entity43 nominee @entity47 compared to @entity48 four years ago . the question is not will @entity14 dominate the @entity20 vote , it is whether @entity20 turnout will rival 2008 levels -- here and in other key battlegrounds . @entity3 is a little worried . " yes , yes , it is a little bit harder , " she says of the then and now . " sometimes some of them say , ' well i do n't know who to vote for - these two evils , you know . ' " she is a battle - tested volunteer . and shrugs off the idea that this time around is more discouraging . " you go , ' you know , you voted for this person last time . give him another chance . ... he needs four more years to do what he needs to do . ' " as critical as @entity20 turnout is for @entity14 in @entity1 , the intensity -- and strength -- of the evangelical vote is a pivotal piece of @entity47 's path to victory in the state . " he can not win unless he wins convincingly among evangelicals , " said pastor @entity79 of the @entity80 in @entity81 , a close - in @entity83 suburb . math backs up that assessment ; white evangelicals made up 23 % of the @entity1 electorate in 2008 . " think about life , think about liberty , think about character and then cast your ballot , " was part of @entity79 's sunday sermon at @entity83 . @entity79 steered clear of any mention of the candidates or political party from the pulpit , though in an interview he made it clear he will vote for @entity47 -- but not without some hesitation . " i was a little frustrated because he seems to have equivocated on the issue of life , and then he has come down quite dramatically on the issue of life , " @entity79 said at a suburban sanctuary that was once a supermarket . in talking to many of his 1,200 congregants , @entity79 said the consistent complaint is unhappiness with both major presidential candidates . " the frustration of not wanting to vote for either , " @entity79 said . " so i feel my role is to encourage people to vote . " will they ? @entity79 said his conversations convince him the combination of economic and values concerns are going to motivate a high evangelical turnout -- " a far greater turnout " than in 2008 . visits to the competing campaign headquarters and satellite offices provide instant proof of the urgent emphasis on turnout - the so - called ground game , including nudging less reliable voters to take advantage of @entity1 's early voting window , which opens october 22 . " we are , i believe , at ground zero in the presidential election , " is the view of veteran @entity134 strategist @entity133 . heading into the final four weeks , @entity133 said @entity1 is again up for grabs -- and a new @entity140 poll released this past weekend backs that up . in the survey , @entity14 received 47 % support to 43 % for @entity47 . just shy of six in 10 @entity144 said the economy was the top issue , and they gave @entity47 a slight edge ( 50 % - to 45 % ) when asked which candidate would do a better job on the economy . poll : @entity14 slightly ahead in @entity1 , @entity47 won debate " before the concept of red and blue , before the concept of purple , you remember they called @entity1 a ticket splitter state , " @entity133 said in a coffee shop interview across the street from his @entity83 office . @entity163 won @entity1 in 1992 , but lost it in 1996 . @entity164 carried it twice , but never with more than 52 % of the vote . then @entity14 returned @entity1 to the blue column in 2008 , winning rather comfortably with 54 % . since then , however , unemployment in the state has risen a bit , from 7.2 % when @entity14 took office to 8.2 % now . in the @entity140 poll , 23 % of @entity144 said their personal economic situation had improved over the past year , 41 % said it has stayed the same , and 36 % said it was worse . in addition to evangelicals , @entity133 said @entity47 can safely count on deep support from the state 's @entity179 voters - like @entity47 members of the @entity182 . " in some places , as you know , there are concerns about @entity187 , " @entity133 said . " people here all know @entity179 . they are family people . you wo n't hear as in some parts of the country , ' who are these people ? are they some weird cult or something ? ' ... the @entity179 thing helps him here . " the keys for the president , he said , are healthy turnout among @entity39 and a heavy focus on suburban women . on that front , @entity133 believes the @entity43 convention gave @entity134 some help . " some of this regressive rhetoric about getting rid of @entity207 or taking birth control out of a women 's health plan - that is troublesome to voters , " @entity133 said . " women are a larger majority of voters in @entity1 than they are in a lot of states . " both campaigns said having @entity83 as the site of last week 's first presidential debate helped bring extra enthusiasm to their state organizations . " it will be close here , " @entity133 said .

former @entity2 ceo was first woman to lead @placeholder company	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- former @entity2 ceo @entity1 finally made it official wednesday : she 's running for @entity4 in @entity5 . the first woman to lead a @entity8 company made the announcement at an event in conservative @entity11 , pledging that her focus will be on " economic recovery and fiscal accountability " " the decisions made in @entity16 impact every family and every business , of any size , in @entity20 . throughout my career , i 've brought people together and solved problems , and that is what i plan to do in government : set aside ego and partisanship and work to develop solutions to our problems , " she told supporters . " i will not settle for a jobless recovery , and we must start the important work of getting our financial house back in order , " @entity1 added . " @entity16 must show discipline to cut spending and create policies that encourage and empower businesses and put people back to work . " @entity1 , considered to be a moderate @entity46 with little history on social issues , will face off against conservative @entity5 assemblyman @entity49 for the @entity46 nomination . in a friendly statement wednesday , @entity49 said he looks forward " to engaging [ her ] on the issues @entity5 care about . " a recent @entity55 poll suggested that both @entity1 and @entity49 polled at about 20 percent , with 60 percent of @entity46 voters undecided . the @entity58 500 ceo , who left @entity2 in 2005 with a severance package estimated to be worth between $ 21.5 million and $ 40 million , is expected to enjoy a significant financial advantage over @entity49 , who entered october with just $ 144,000 in the bank . the @entity1 - @entity63 matchup has all the makings of another @entity46 battle between the conservative wing of the party and national leaders seeking the most electable candidate . @entity1 has claimed that the @entity70 is backing her bid , though an @entity73 spokesman said no official endorsement has been made . still , @entity73 chairman @entity75 pointed to @entity1 in september as an example of a " strong female candidate " running as a @entity46 in 2010 . a string of conservative bloggers have lined up behind @entity49 , and @entity81 sen. @entity80 said tuesday that he was backing the assemblyman . the winner of that race will face three - term sen. @entity85 in november . @entity85 's favorable rating stood at 48 percent in a recent @entity55 poll , a number that gives @entity46 hope she is vulnerable against a well - funded opponent . @entity85 is known to be a formidable political opponent , but @entity1 said wednesday that she 's ready for the challenge . " after chemothereapy , @entity85 just really is n't that scary any more , especially when you know what to expect , " said @entity1 , who battled breast cancer last spring . " she has always taken the low road to high office . " though spending most of her life outside of politics , @entity1 is no stranger to the campaign trail , having served as one of then - @entity46 presidential candidate @entity103 's chief surrogates in 2008 . @entity1 was eventually sidelined from that campaign after telling an interviewer that she did n't think either member of the @entity46 presidential ticket was qualified to run a major company . in an election season in which the state 's economic condition is set to dominate the debate , @entity1 is now the second high - profile former ceo running for statewide office in @entity5 . former @entity117 ceo @entity116 announced last month she is running for governor . national democrats , meanwhile , appear eager to take on @entity1 , who left @entity2 five years ago amid controversy . " the hallmark of @entity1 's r√©sum√© is her tenure at @entity2 , where she laid off 28,000 @entity20 while shipping jobs overseas , just before taking a $ 21 million golden parachute , " @entity122 spokesman @entity121 said .

the @entity6 began in @placeholder	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- polls closed late sunday in @entity1 , the torchbearer of the so - called @entity6 , but voters will not see results of national elections until tuesday , officials said . on sunday , long lines of voters snaked around schools - turned - polling - stations in @entity0 's upscale @entity14 neighborhood , some waiting for hours to cast a vote in the nation 's first national elections since the country 's independence in 1956 . " it 's a wonderful day . it 's the first time we can choose our own representatives , " said @entity21 , a civil engineer who waited more than two hours , and who brought along his 3 - year - old son @entity23 so he could " get used to freedom and democracy . " @entity1 's election is the first since a popular uprising in january overthrew long - time dictator @entity32 @entity32 and triggered a wave of revolutions -- referred to as the @entity6 -- across the region . more than 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates competed for 218 seats in a new @entity39 , which will be charged with writing a new constitution and laying the framework for a government system . voters appeared jubilant on sunday , taking photos of each other outside polling stations , some holding @entity1 flags . " it 's a holiday , " said housewife @entity48 , who had just taken her position at the end of the long line of more than 1,000 voters waiting outside an elementary school in @entity14 . " before we never even had the right to say ' yes ' or ' no. ' " nearby , banker aid @entity57 said she did n't mind the long wait to vote . " we have waited years for this , " @entity57 said . @entity60 burst out of a classroom waving a @entity1 flag and smiling broadly moments after he voted . he said he and his wife , @entity64 , had a sleepless night in anticipation of the vote . they showed up at 7 a.m. when polls officially opened and waited for three hours . " we waited 50 years for this , " a triumphant @entity60 said . @entity72 's eyes filled with tears as she tried to express the emotion of the moment . but partisan politics were already on display here . the @entity78 both said they came in part to vote against @entity81 , the once - banned moderate @entity83 party that consistently scored highest in public opinion polls in the weeks leading up to the election . the campaign period marked an escalation in tension between secular and religious tunisians . religious groups staged angry protests that sometimes turned violent at universities and a private tv channel , to show opposition to the broadcast of the animated film " @entity97 , " which included a depiction of god . meanwhile , prominent secular politicians , like the @entity102 's @entity101 campaigned on @entity104 platforms , warning voters that a victory for the party would mark a setback for @entity1 's development as a secular state . @entity1 's election -- nearly 9 months since the overthrow of president @entity113 @entity32 -- has been praised by @entity115 president @entity114 .

" bachelor " director @entity24 , @entity28 and @placeholder helped produce	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 and @entity2 , known for their maniacally inventive manipulation of action figures on " @entity6 , " now want the viewing public to have a similar sense of control over a real person . their vision arrives in the form of " @entity14 , " a new web series that takes the standard reality format and adds to it an element of interactivity , possibly creating a novel form of entertainment in the process . @entity1 and @entity2 are joined in the venture by " the bachelor " director @entity24 , former president of @entity27 , @entity28 , commercial director @entity29 and the full - service video network @entity30 . the premise of " @entity14 " is simple : for six weeks , the life of an unemployed 20 - something named @entity35 is documented and streamed live on the internet for 18 hours a day . the hook is that he 's agreed to relinquish his own free will for that of the collective , meaning viewers can vote on just about everything he does . they 'll decide what he eats , where he goes , who he dates , even the frequency and duration of his workouts , all in real time . to some , this might sound like an opportunity for a bunch of web - trolling sadists to anonymously mess with a stranger , but @entity1 and @entity2 's intentions seem genuinely benevolent . @entity35 's at a cross-roads in his life , does n't have a job , a girlfriend or an abundance of accomplishments , and he 's basically not sure what to do with himself . the hope is that viewers will help him figure that out , that the wisdom of the crowd will point him in the right direction . it helps that @entity35 's a likable guy , as his success will probably depend on whether or not the voters are pulling for him . the show 's essentially a character study , but not only of @entity35 . it 's the general character of the audience , or people in general , that will be revealed most tellingly , based on how they treat him . lastly , it 's worth noting that " @entity14 " is much less filtered than other reality shows . nothing much happens at times , but that 's almost preferable to the overly - contrived situations that typify rest of the genre . as we watch @entity35 make breakfast , click a mouse or sit in a chair , we 'll be surprised most of all by the fact that we 're still watching , but @entity1 and @entity2 understand that even the most mundane moments can become fascinating from a voyeuristic distance .	@entity2:Matt Senreich	@entity1:Seth Green	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Tristan Couvares	@entity6:Robot Chicken	@entity24:Ken Fuchs	@entity30:DBG	@entity28:Richard Saperstein	@entity29:Stephen Kessler	@entity14:ControlTV	@entity27:Dimension Films
the @placeholder already passed the compromise budget plan	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a federal budget compromise that already passed the @entity3 cleared a key procedural hurdle on tuesday in the @entity5 , increasing the likelihood it will win final @entity9 approval this week . president @entity10 has signaled his support for the plan worked out by the budget committee leaders in each chamber that would guide government spending into 2015 to defuse the chances of another shutdown such as the one that took place in october . tuesday 's vote overcame a @entity23 filibuster attempt that required 60 votes in the 100 - member chamber to proceed on the budget measure . the count was 67 - 33 , with a dozen republicans joining the 55 @entity30 and independents in support of the plan . 5 ways @entity5 could mess it up final approval in the @entity5 requires a simple majority of 51 votes . the budget plan easily passed the @entity3 last week on a 332 - 94 vote . @entity23 concerns the politics of the issue were clear in tuesday 's vote breakdown . only one @entity23 senator facing a primary challenge in their re-election campaigns voted with @entity30 to overcome the @entity23 filibuster -- @entity47 of @entity48 . @entity47 has indicated he will oppose the budget plan in the final vote later this week . a new @entity53 / @entity52 poll released tuesday showed 50 % of respondents approving of the budget plan while 35 % opposed it . according to the survey , a majority of @entity30 and independents backed the proposal , while only 39 % of @entity29 liked it . some @entity5 @entity29 said before tuesday 's vote that the most important thing for now was to lower the budget deficit , even if only by a small percentage , and prevent further government shutdowns like the 16 - day stoppage in october that proved politically damaging to the @entity23 . sen. @entity67 , who was lobbied to support the bill negotiated by fellow @entity69 @entity23 rep. @entity23 , said he wanted " to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns . " " the federal government does enough harm to our economy , " @entity67 said . " we do n't need to add additional harm by this crisis management . in the end this is not the kind of deal i would want to see . i 'm sure it 's not the kind of deal @entity23 would want to produce . " conservative @entity23 sen. @entity83 of @entity84 said in a statement that " sometimes the answer has to be yes . " " ultimately , his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and , with @entity30 controlling the @entity3 and the @entity5 , it is the best we can hope for , " he said of the plan @entity23 negotiated with @entity30 sen. @entity88 of @entity0 . @entity1 vote count : budget deal nearing @entity5 approval , but not there yet final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a @entity9 infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off . democrats wary , too while @entity30 supported the bill , many had concerns . more liberal senators -- like @entity112 of @entity113 -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal . " there 's over a million people now who can not find a job , out of work , and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off , " @entity112 told @entity116 last week . " it 's really unconscionable . " poll : @entity9 neck - and - neck with car salespeople , lobbyists for least honest budget deal the budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across - the - board spending cuts , known as the sequester , on defense and non-defense programs . overall , it calls for more than $ 20 billion in deficit reduction . current federal spending expires in mid-january , raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there 's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled . the strong vote in the @entity3 on the budget plan on thursday brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters , who initially thought it would sail through the @entity5 , where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided @entity3 . do n't expect @entity153 to totally change his tune but after reading details of the agreement , many @entity29 -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill . " i 'd really like to stay within the ( spending ) caps , " complained @entity23 sen. @entity159 of @entity160 . " this busts the caps and as a result i 'll vote against it .

@placeholder won two @entity4 10,000m golds before turning to marathons	@entity6	he 's broken every record in the book and won a glut of @entity4 and world titles , but even at the age of 40 , @entity6 has no intention of resting on his laurels . " a day without running is not a good day , " the @entity11 athletics legend told @entity12 's @entity13 . " running , you continue until you die . " which spells bad news for his fellow competitors , although @entity6 does acknowledge he will have to call it quits at some stage . " competition stops somewhere , but when i do n't know , " he says . " what i 'm thinking now , is that i want to break all the @entity25 records -- over 40 , over 50 , over 60 . " i do n't know how long i 'm going to live after this , but i hope the next 100 years ! " he adds , breaking into his trademark grin . " the smiling assassin " -- as he was once famously dubbed -- has been dispatching his opponents with ruthless efficiency for over two decades and is hugely popular wherever he runs , not least among his dedicated following of @entity11 fans bedecked in their country 's green , yellow and red . " @entity6 , @entity6 " will be the chant as their hero winds up the pace before unleashing his trademark blistering finish to leave rivals trailing . his longtime @entity43 manager @entity42 summed it up perfectly : " his smile makes athletics smile . " throughout his glittering career stretching over two decades , @entity6 has proved an impeccable ambassador for track and field . despite increasing business commitments , he is finding time to pass on that experience to pass on to the next generation -- acting as a mentor for 14 young athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds for the @entity58 4teen program ahead of the @entity59 . those youngsters , who came from around the world , would do well to heed his renowned sportsmanship , because win or lose it was always with that smile on his face . " of course there is disappointment when you lose a race , " he told @entity12 . " for me , it 's in my character , maybe i can say good character . i am always joyful . " glittering career disappointments have proved few and far between since his first competitive race at the age of 14 and while still in his teens he captured a 5,000/10,000 meters double at the world junior championships in @entity80 . the next year in 1993 saw @entity6 's senior breakthrough as he claimed the first of four straight 10,000m world championship titles after a battle royal with @entity86 @entity85 in @entity87 . his world - record - breaking spree started in 1994 , covering distances from 2,000m on an indoor track to the full 42 km of the marathon . watch : the best long distance runner ever ? @entity6 rates his 5,000m performance at the weltklasse meeting in @entity95 in 1995 as his " most memorable achievement " -- he smashed the record of @entity86 's @entity98 by nearly 11 seconds with a time of 12 minutes 44.39 seconds . " that was amazing , " he said . metronomically lapping the 400m track at just over four - minute mile pace for over three miles , he says that as he ran the beat of the 1995 hit song " @entity108 ( @entity107 - @entity106 - @entity105 ) " kept ringing around his head . " it 's nice music , if 's fast written , that 's why i could break a world record , by that music , " he recalls . " i 'm a @entity108 ! @entity115 and then you know the timing and at the same time your style changes immediately . " @entity4 gold @entity6 won his first @entity4 gold at @entity122 ' 96 over his favored 10,000m distance , just edging out his arch - rival @entity124 . four years later , in @entity125 , he became only the third man in history to retain that title -- the @entity86 again the victim . " i won that race nine - hundredths of a second from @entity124 . that was really the one still i love to watch . it was a very special moment . " by the time the @entity135 came around , the balance of power had shifted to his compatriot @entity136 , and @entity137 came fifth as he missed out on a hat - trick , but by then he had already turned to road running and marathons . @entity4 gold over the classic distance has eluded him ; he decided against competing in the marathon in @entity144 in 2008 because of the air quality , and was controversially left out of the @entity11 team for the @entity147 last year . but over distances from 10 km through half - marathon and the full marathon , the records have tumbled . successive wins in the @entity154 marathon in 2007 and 2008 each came with world bests , the second of two hours three minutes and 59 seconds -- the first man under the two hours four minute mark . @entity108 rhythm for the longer distances , he says the @entity162 tune is replaced by the need to set the perfect pace and to keep a close eye on the opposition , often years younger . " you are just thinking about your race . who is next to you , who is behind you , who 's in the race , how fast does he run , what is the way breathes , " he reveals . " when you run a marathon especially , the first 15k they 're perfect , but the things happen after 20k . you can look and see , ' oh this guy , now he 's getting tired , ' so it 's easy to beat him . " years of disciplined training , getting up at 5 a.m. each morning , have left @entity6 a battle - hardened veteran and have helped him in his life outside of track and field . watch : @entity6 dominates @entity186 marathon two grueling training sessions are interspersed by a day spent in his office -- he employs over 500 people in range of enterprises based right across @entity11 . he is usually in bed by 10 p.m. after spending time with his wife and family -- he has a son and three daughters . @entity6 certainly knew the value of hard work from his formative years , growing up in humble surroundings in the town of @entity201 in @entity202 , living nearly 2,500m above sea level . one of 10 children , he used to run several kilometers each day to school and back to his family 's small farm . early inspiration inspired from an early age by the 5,000/10,000 @entity4 double of great @entity11 runner @entity212 " @entity215 " yifter in the 1980 @entity214 -- " i was dreaming to be like him " -- @entity6 acknowledges that his environment was the perfect platform . " we live at altitude , we were born in altitude , " he says . " going to school , helping our parents , fetching water from the river . my training started when i was two . it was part of my life . " but @entity6 is concerned that the neverending trail of talent from his country , characterized by the likes of @entity136 and women 's champion @entity232 , could be under threat from increased affluence -- welcome though that is in a country which has suffered so much . " life is changing a little bit . that 's why it 's very difficult to produce more long - distance runners from @entity11 , " he says . " the more good things you have , the less athletes you have . you do n't see so much athletes from @entity246 ( the capital ) . you do n't see so much athletes from the city , most of our athletes they come from the countryside . " with his ambassadorial work , @entity6 is doing his best to make sure the conveyor belt of champions continues for a while yet . role model " it 's important to inspire people . without a role model it 's not an easy job , " he says . " i 'm teaching everybody how they become successful . one is to be disciplined . second , commitment or a goal , and third is hard work . " he has one key message to his youngsters and the wider public : " win for yourself . " " what is that ? sometimes you know people promise to stop smoking , to stop drinking , to stop taking drugs . but they , after one day or after two days , they can not , which means they 've lost for themselves . " i ask people win themselves first , which means you can win anything that you dream , that you plan , what you want . this really is my tip for everyone . " @entity290 to his incredible talent and will to win , @entity6 has certainly " won for himself " in bundles down the years -- dominating distance running and becoming one of the most recognizable sportsman on the planet . judging by his recent performances -- winner of april 's @entity300 half - marathon , third in a world - class @entity301 10 km last month and smashing the best for a 40 - year - old at the distance -- @entity6 will be delighting his fans for a few more years to come as he sticks to his endearing philosophy for life .	@entity25:Masters	@entity144:Beijing	@entity98:Moses Kiptanui	@entity80:Seoul	@entity115:Dum dum	@entity85:Moses Tanui	@entity86:Kenyan	@entity87:Stuttgart	@entity135:2004 Olympics	@entity137:Gebreselassie	@entity136:Bekele	@entity124:Paul Tergat	@entity154:Berlin	@entity214:Moscow Games	@entity215:The Shifter	@entity6:Gebrselassie	@entity212:Miruts	@entity4:Olympic	@entity122:Atlanta	@entity59:London 2012 Olympics	@entity58:G4S	@entity290:Allied	@entity232:Tirunesh Dibaba	@entity13:Human to Hero Series	@entity12:CNN	@entity11:Ethiopian	@entity246:Addis Ababa	@entity147:London Games	@entity105:Dop-Bop	@entity106:Ba-Bop-Ba	@entity107:Ski	@entity108:Scatman	@entity202:Arsi Province	@entity201:Asella	@entity125:Sydney	@entity95:Zurich	@entity162:Scatman John	@entity300:Vienna	@entity301:Manchester	@entity186:Dubai	@entity42:Jos Hermens	@entity43:Dutch
" these charges still remain just as unfounded , " @placeholder 's lawyer says	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- experts disagreed tuesday over whether @entity2 is likely to be extradited to @entity3 , where the country 's highest criminal court overturned her acquittal and that of her former boyfriend in the 2007 killing of her roommate , @entity8 . @entity10 and @entity11 were convicted in 2009 of murder in @entity14 's death , but a jury overturned the conviction in 2011 . she then returned to her home city of @entity19 , @entity20 , where she is studying creative writing at the @entity22 , according to her family 's spokesman , @entity25 . a @entity27 court or the @entity28 would be unlikely to take up any extradition request from @entity3 , said @entity30 , a former prosecutor who is now a partner at @entity31 in @entity32 . he cited an extradition treaty between the @entity27 and @entity3 that states : " extradition shall not be granted when the person sought has been convicted , acquitted or pardoned , or has served the sentence imposed , by the @entity37 for the same acts for which extradition is requested . " " under @entity27 law , she was once put in jeopardy and later acquitted , " @entity30 said . " under the treaty , extradition should not be granted . " in 2011 , deputy @entity28 spokesman @entity45 told @entity0 that although the @entity27 and @entity3 have an extradition treaty , he was not able to answer speculative questions on extradition issues in the @entity10 case . tuesday , @entity28 acting deputy spokesman @entity50 noted that the matter was ongoing , and the @entity3 court 's full ruling had not been released . " we ca n't really comment beyond that , " he told reporters . " we never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases . " @entity10 may be protected on another level , too , according to @entity30 . " her original verdict was so terribly flawed by prosecutorial overreaching , " the lawyer said , noting that the appellate court that overturned the original conviction detailed those flaws in a damning report more than 100 pages in length . timeline : @entity8 murder case given those errors , " i would expect @entity3 law enforcement to not seek extradition , because it would only prolong this law enforcement ordeal . " but @entity79 professor @entity78 said that @entity3 prosecutors might very well extradite @entity10 . and , if retried , she " likely will be found guilty -- because the evidence supporting a conviction is pretty strong . " @entity10 , now 25 , has established a fan base in the @entity27 " because she has a beautiful face and an angelic appearance , " @entity78 said . " but remember , she originally admitted she was at the scene of the crime and she tried to blame an innocent man -- for which she was also convicted . " after @entity10 and @entity11 were detained for questioning in the killing , she allegedly confessed to being at her home when @entity14 was killed and implicated @entity8 , the owner of a bar where she worked . @entity98 was detained , but was released after two weeks when his alibi was corroborated : he had spent the night of the murder talking to a customer in his pub in @entity103 , police say . he went on to sue @entity10 for libel , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages . @entity78 said the case was not well tried the first time . " but at a second trial , there 's a very high likelihood that they may very well convict her . " he predicted that @entity10 would resist any extradition attempt . but even if she were to succeed in that , " she remains a prisoner in the @entity27 , because @entity116 will put a warrant out for her and , if she travels anywhere outside the @entity27 , she 'll be immediately arrested and turned over to @entity3 . " if @entity10 were to lose an extradition fight and then wind up being convicted , she would go to jail , he said . @entity2 : fascination with ' the evil female ' if he were advising @entity14 's parents , @entity78 said , he would recommend that they file a civil suit to claim the money @entity10 has received as an advance for a book about the case that is scheduled for publication next month . " they have a right to sue her on behalf of their dead daughter , " he said , noting that the standard required for conviction in civil cases is a preponderance of the evidence . " i think that would be easy to do . " and the extradition treaty 's reference to double jeopardy may not be binding in some cases , he said . " in the @entity27 , generally , when you appeal a conviction , you waive your double jeopardy rights , and we permit retrials of people who have had their convictions reversed , at least on procedural grounds , " he said . and what about @entity30 's prediction that @entity3 law enforcement would not seek extradition ? " i think he 's wrong , " @entity78 said . " i think the @entity3 legal system will welcome a second trial . they 'll put new prosecutors on the case , good ones , and seek to vindicate themselves . " " they will want to have a second opportunity to show that @entity3 justice can be pure . " @entity78 said purity has also eluded many members of the @entity27 news media who have covered the case closely . " one issue is why the @entity27 media portrayed her in such positive terms , " he said . " at best , she was a terrible person who tried to blame it on some innocent person and she was clearly a liar , and at worst she participated in a horrible murder , and the @entity27 media focused much more on @entity2 than on the victim of the case because @entity2 was prettier and an @entity27 and an @entity27 sweetheart . " had she been ugly , he argued , the case would have attracted little attention . @entity10 's lawyer , @entity186 , told @entity0 that his client was not guilty .

state - run @placeholder , citing medical sources , says he 's dead	@entity6	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- reports conflicted wednesday over whether the 84 - year - old former president of @entity0 , @entity4 , was clinically dead . the state - run @entity6 , citing medical sources , said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late tuesday at a military hospital in @entity1 , where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day . but gen. @entity13 , a member of the @entity14 , told @entity2 , " he is not clinically dead as reported , but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition . " fast facts on the life of @entity4 @entity4 was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the @entity23 suburb of @entity1 , @entity13 said . " he had a heart attack and his heart stopped and he was saved by electric shocks , then placed on respirator , " he said . " his pulse is 40 . he then got a brain clot . he is not clinically dead as reported but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition . " and @entity4 's lawyer , @entity31 , told @entity2 , " he has been in a coma for hours now . he has had water on the lungs for 10 days now and his blood pressure is down today , which obstructed his breathing and forced doctors to put him on a respirator . he was given medicine intravenously to relieve the brain clot , and electric shocks were used to revive him but there was no substantial response . he is not dead as reported . " @entity31 added that @entity4 's wife , @entity44 , was at his side . he blamed @entity14 for not having moved @entity4 last week from the prison to the hospital . @entity48 , the official spokesman of the @entity0 prosecutor , had said earlier , " we were informed by prison authority that @entity4 's heart has stopped and they used electric shocks and cpr to resurrect him . he is now on an artificial respirator and doctors from the armed forces and @entity59 will inspect him . " @entity60 reported that @entity4 had suffered a stroke . he was taken from @entity63 hospital to @entity23 military hospital , @entity31 told @entity2 . " he has suffered a stroke , but he is not dead . " the prosecutor and the military council denied @entity4 had been moved . his health had been reported in decline since he was ousted as president of @entity0 in february 2011 and found guilty of charges related to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution . last week , an @entity76 spokesman said he was comatose ; the spokesman said he suffered from high blood pressure , irregular heartbeats and difficulty breathing . " we should be skeptical , " said @entity81 , a senior fellow at @entity83 's @entity82 . " there 's a great @entity87 expression i like and it asks the following question : when you 're told that someone is dead , you say , ' is he dead and buried , or just dead ? ' i think we are in the middle of this kind of situation . " " clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used , but when it is used , what it usually means is that someone is brain dead , " said @entity2 senior medical correspondent @entity94 . " in the @entity101 , we would call this person dead because they have no brain activity . " meanwhile , crowds jammed @entity106 once again on wednesday . but their focus this time was not on @entity4 . instead , it was on the power grab by the @entity0 military , which last week issued a constitutional decree that stripped the position of president of much of its power after a top court dissolved the parliament . those moves were followed by the nation 's first presidential election , which pitted @entity123 candidate @entity122 against @entity4 's former prime minister , @entity124 . final results have not been announced . " it 's a media stunt to divert attention from the constitutional decree , " said @entity126 , a demonstrator in the square . " if he 's really dead , it wo n't make a difference . we 've started a sit - in and wo n't leave unless the @entity14 leaves unconditionally . " " i 've come from far away . i 'm not leaving until @entity122 swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament , " said demonstrator @entity136 . " i do n't care about @entity4 . these are games played by the intelligence services . " " if he 's really dead , its @entity143 's will , " said @entity142 , another demonstrator . " i would hope he lives to see the new president . " outside @entity147 , shortly before midnight tuesday , there was no additional security . instead , there were a few policemen outside the main gate and two military police inside the gate . across the street perhaps a half - dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes . have you witnessed demonstrations in the @entity87 world ? tell us what you see . follow coverage on @entity165 @entity166 contributed to this report for @entity2	@entity23:Maadi	@entity81:Fouad Ajami	@entity82:Hoover Institution	@entity83:Stanford University	@entity87:Arab	@entity136:Sayed Ahmed	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Cairo	@entity0:Egyptian	@entity6:Middle East News Agency	@entity4:Mubarak	@entity59:International Medical Center	@entity76:Interior Ministry	@entity31:El Deeb	@entity14:Supreme Council of the Armed Forces	@entity13:Shaheen	@entity101:United States	@entity106:Tahrir Square	@entity126:Taha Shaker	@entity124:Ahmed Safik	@entity94:Elizabeth Cohen	@entity122:Morsi	@entity123:Muslim Brotherhood	@entity147:Maadi Military Hospital	@entity166:Mohamed Fadel Fahmy	@entity142:Nasser Shaaban	@entity143:God	@entity165:CNN Arabic	@entity44:Suzanne	@entity48:Adel Saeed	@entity63:Tora prison	@entity60:Nile TV
president @placeholder has not been visible on the campaign trail for his final midterm election as president	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- president @entity3 's final campaign is n't turning into much of a victory lap. his role in next week 's midterm elections , which amount to the last important contest of his political career , has been to quietly rake in campaign cash for the @entity13 party , rather than headline the stadium rallies he became famous for in 2008 and 2012 . the final week before the midterm elections is slated to be @entity3 's busiest , though the eleventh - hour politicking will only take the president to states that went his direction in 2008 and 2012 . he 'll campaign mostly for governors , whose role outside @entity0 puts them further from the unpopular @entity26 policies that give @entity13 @entity28 candidates heartburn . the objective : turning out democrats who do n't have a great record voting in midterm contests . his lone stop for a @entity28 candidate comes in @entity35 on saturday for @entity37 @entity36 , currently running ten points ahead of @entity40 rival @entity39 . @entity41 stopped spending ad money there weeks ago . @entity3 's truncated campaign schedule only reflects how big a drag the unpopular commander - in - chief is on his party 's most vulnerable @entity28 candidates . the electoral calendar has left @entity13 uniquely positioned to lose control of the upper chamber , a fact party insiders are already citing ahead of potential losses . related : @entity28 races in 2014 related : @entity1 / @entity56 poll - voters are angry in @entity40 - leaning states like @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity13 are scrambling to keep seats amid near - record lows in @entity3 's approval ratings . @entity13 senators are working to convince swing electorates that @entity3 's policies are n't necessarily their own in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 . and in @entity40 strongholds like @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity13 candidates are quick to promise total independence from an unpopular @entity26 . that leaves @entity3 with few options to return to the campaign trail ‚Äî his last opportunity as president . on tuesday he flew to @entity80 , where the @entity81 gov. @entity81 is virtually tied with his @entity13 challenger @entity82 in a race that 's focused largely on the state 's economy . it 's one of the nation 's marquee governor 's race -- one @entity13 desperately want to win -- and the highest - profile contest to feature a visit from @entity3 . that @entity92 , a former @entity93 bicycle executive , does n't have to answer for an @entity3 - aligned voting record makes a visit from the president tenable . and with a statewide approval figure of 51 % , according to a recent @entity99 survey , @entity3 's in far better shape in @entity80 than he is nationwide . related : @entity28 math seems impossible to some democrats " the goal of the visit is to persuade the once - every - four - year voters to vote this time , " said @entity103 , a professor of governmental affairs at the @entity104 . " in @entity80 politics , the higher the turnout , the more it skews @entity13 . the lower the turnout , the more it tilts @entity40 . so this is [ @entity92 's ] effort to increase the size of the pie rather than fighting over the small remaining undecided slice of the current pie . " @entity3 's other stops this week -- thursday in @entity119 for @entity13 gubernatorial candidate @entity120 , friday in @entity121 for remarks targeting women voters , and sunday in @entity124 for @entity13 gov. @entity125 -- are also meant to turn out @entity13 in states where he still remains somewhat popular . in @entity119 , @entity3 's objective will be to get @entity13 voters to " act like @entity13 , " said @entity129 , a political science professor at the @entity130 in @entity119 , citing past elections there that have seen independent candidates shave away support from @entity13 .

@entity208 : @entity9 are aware that the @placeholder may be as corrupt as ever	@entity8	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- they 're baaaaack . with apologies to @entity5 , it seems that rumors of the death of @entity9 's @entity8 were greatly exaggerated . in fact , i probably wrote that obituary myself , more than once . that 's how it looked in 2000 , when the @entity8 , known as @entity8 , lost the presidency to @entity15 of the @entity16 , or @entity16 . it seemed even more certain in 2006 , when the @entity8 came in a distant third in the presidential election among the three major parties , behind both the conservative @entity16 and the leftist @entity21 , known as @entity22 . it seemed that the @entity8 , which controlled the presidency for 71 years and became synonymous with violence and corruption , was on the road to extinction . but the party has made a comeback . as expected , the top vote getter in @entity9 's presidential election on sunday was @entity8 candidate @entity33 . the 45 - year - old former governor of @entity9 's most populous state , the one with the matinee idol good looks and the movie star wife , got about 38 % of the vote . @entity22 candidate @entity40 came in second with about 32 % . the @entity16 's @entity42 got just 25 % . this is despite the fact that @entity33 's public image took a lot of hits during the campaign . in december , the candidate struggled at a literary fair to name three books that had influenced him . when he was criticized for the flub by the country 's intelligentsia , his daughter poured gasoline on the fire by insisting , on @entity58 , that the story was driven by class envy . later , in an interview with a @entity63 newspaper , @entity33 admitted that he did n't know the price of a package of tortillas . when criticized for being out of touch , he insisted chauvinistically that he was n't " the woman of the household . " he also admitted in another interview that he was unfaithful to his late wife and fathered two children with two women during his marriage . these tidbits normally tantalize the media . but @entity9 's version of @entity78 , led by the gargantuan multimedia company @entity79 , has been a big fan of @entity33 . their cozy relationship was one of the things that , in recent weeks , drove hundreds of thousands of student protesters into the streets to protest the candidate 's likely election and the fact that the elites who run @entity9 seemed to be ramrodding @entity33 into office . the @entity93 is @entity9 's liberal version of the tea party , challenging the establishment and determined to be heard . even former president @entity15 crossed party lines and endorsed @entity33 , against the @entity16 's own candidate , @entity42 . that maneuver only solidified the cynical view of many @entity9 that the fix was in , and that the two major parties are more alike than different . still , many voters fell in line . now , after 12 years of being on the outside , the pri - istas are back in power . not that they were ever far from it . at various times in the last decade , even when it did n't hold the presidency , the @entity8 kept control of the @entity113 . the party also used this control to thwart reforms pushed by @entity117 and his successor , @entity118 . as many @entity9 see it , the @entity8 was always plotting its retaking of the presidency , even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption . has that legacy been overcome ? it 's hard to say . some @entity9 seem willing to believe that this is not their father 's @entity8 and that the party of today bears no resemblance to the one that was run from office a dozen years ago . but the more common view seems to be that , despite the makeover , the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters . judging from what they 're telling reporters , @entity9 are looking for a leader to grow the economy , turn @entity9 into a first - world country , and , most of all , stop a war with the drug cartels that has in the last 5¬Ω years resulted in the deaths of more than 50,000 @entity9 . that is the @entity8 's promise . the party racked up major victories in the 2009 midterm elections by insisting that it could provide prosperity and security . that 's code for : " elect us , and we 'll stop the drug war . " but can it deliver ? i doubt it . what started nearly six years ago as an offensive by the government against the drug cartels has now morphed into a messy turf war between rival gangs eager to gobble up the country one city at a time . my sense is that the @entity8 could n't stop the war , even if it wanted to . besides , if you listen to what @entity33 has been saying in the last several weeks about combating drug violence , it sounds like what the @entity9 people typically hear from @entity118 . consequently , most experts do n't expect a dramatic shift in the drug war or how the government goes about fighting it . shortly after winning , @entity33 told the @entity185 that while he is committed to reducing the violence , " there will be no pact or truce with organized crime . " for those of us who believe that this is a righteous cause and a battle worth fighting , one that affects countless lives on both sides of the border , that 's good news . meanwhile , we 'll have to wait and see whether the election of @entity33 turns out to be good news for @entity9 . join us on @entity205 / @entity204 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .	@entity22:PRD	@entity21:Democratic Revolutionary Party	@entity15:Vicente Fox	@entity117:Fox	@entity113:Mexican Congress	@entity118:Calderon	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:San Diego	@entity5:Mark Twain	@entity9:Mexico	@entity8:PRI	@entity79:Grupo Televisa	@entity78:Big Media	@entity58:Twitter	@entity16:PAN	@entity33:Pe√±a Nieto	@entity208:Navarrette	@entity93:132 Movement	@entity205:Facebook	@entity204:CNNOpinion	@entity185:Financial Times	@entity40:Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador	@entity42:Vazquez Mota	@entity63:Spanish

@placeholder , next @entity4 prime minister , is well known for his pugnacious style	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- the pugnacious style of @entity2 , the winner of @entity4 's election , has played well with the electorate . he may have run a gaffe - prone campaign against the bookish @entity7 , the incumbent @entity8 prime minister , but his knockabout style , which harkens back to older , safer times , proved popular with an electorate exhausted by years of @entity8 infighting . having successfully deflected accusations of sexism -- dismissing a campaign gaffe in which he lauded a @entity18 female candidate for her " sex appeal " as a " dad moment " -- @entity2 has presented himself as an unreconstructed male who loves his sport and beer . in @entity4 's current social climate , which some have attacked for being increasingly insular , self - absorbed and xenophobic , @entity25 's bruising confrontational style has hit a rich seam . politics might be a tough profession , but in few places is it as bruising as in @entity4 where mudslinging and name - calling occur on an almost daily basis . some exchanges in @entity4 parliament are almost the stuff of folk legend . former prime minister @entity40 ( 1991 - 96 ) , when pressed to name an election date , told the leader of the opposition he would n't reveal the date because , " i want to do you slowly . " more recently , the former @entity4 leader recently ousted @entity7 , @entity45 gave the opposition a spirited lecture in sexism that went viral and even drew praise from @entity52 president @entity51 . but not since leader of the @entity8 opposition @entity55 broke a taxi driver 's arm in a dispute over a cab fare in 2001 have @entity4 had the chance to elect a real brawler as premier . @entity55 's bid for prime minister failed , but in @entity25 , the leader of the @entity18 - @entity67 , the country may have found a natural successor . combative in debate and with the media , @entity2 may have shown little of his predecessors ' verbal flair -- recent gaffes had him talking about the " suppository , " rather than the repository , " of all wisdom " -- but he has displayed the kind of dogged aggression that @entity4 like to see in their sportsmen . the boxer a former @entity81 who won an @entity82 in boxing , he allegedly punched the wall either side of the head of a female political rival during his student days in the 1970s . @entity2 claims the incident " never happened . " for one former alumni from his @entity93 secondary school @entity92 , @entity94 , in @entity95 , the episode would not have been out of character . " all i remember is his rictus grin and the rolled - up sleeves of his short - sleeved shirt , giving his biceps something to rub up against , " the former classmate , who now works in the @entity99 banking industry , told @entity0 . " what struck me was the raw emotion he could elicit just by being him . you could pour an enormous bucket on him , and he was not only impervious in terms of being hurt but would grin back at you and give it back -- with compound interest and probably a compound fracture , " he added . while @entity2 is a polarizing figure to the electorate , the socially conservative politician is known to hold complex views in some areas of policy . read more : @entity123 , economy and boat people key issues in @entity4 election he has been known to defend areas of @entity129 -- the country 's national health system normally championed by the @entity8 -- and even opposed his own party on industrial relations reform , arguing that it was too harsh on workers . early beginnings born in @entity137 in 1957 to an @entity4 mother and an @entity137 - born father , he graduated in economics and law from @entity142 where he became involved in the rough and tumble world of student politics . avowedly right - wing at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy on campuses was deeply left - wing , @entity2 , according to one of his biographers @entity152 , was beaten up at a student conference . briefly training as a catholic priest before working variously as a concrete contractor and as a journalist for the @entity4 newspaper , he entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to represent the affluent @entity161 district of @entity95 . under former prime minister @entity163 's government , he served as an employment minister between 1998 and 2001 , and as minister for health and aging in 2003 . in 2009 , he narrowly beat then leader @entity167 in a party leadership vote , winning 42 votes to @entity167 's 41 . he also polled well in @entity4 's 2010 general election , which was called following @entity45 's ouster of @entity7 as prime minister , denying the government a majority and delivering a hung parliament that @entity45 's government could only hold together with the support of independents . @entity8 infighting boosted @entity2 's standing in the polls and -- under @entity45 -- the @entity8 faced certain defeat at elections this year . while the installation of @entity7 as prime minister for a second time has clawed back some of the ground @entity8 lost under @entity45 , many analysts say his arrival has come too late to save the @entity8 . catholic values , populist instincts @entity2 supports lower taxes , smaller government and tough border controls and backs the government 's policy of processing asylum seekers -- many of them illegal boat arrivals -- offshore . he recently announced that almost 32,00 asylum seekers who already in @entity4 will never be granted permanent settlement . he has also pushed a " tow - back " policy that would see asylum seekers ' boats turned around when it is safe to do so . dismissing the climate debate as faddish and fashionable , @entity2 has vowed to roll back the controversial carbon tax put in place by @entity45 , which he has condemned as " socialism masquerading as environmentalism . " he has pledged to get rid of the 30 % mining tax introduced by @entity8 , saying that it is a serious disincentive to investment in @entity4 's booming commodities sector . read more : how @entity4 's prime ministerial candidates view @entity219 on social issues , he has remained true to his catholic faith , consistently voting against relaxing abortion laws , same - sex marriage and stem cell research . he has stated that he wants abortions to be " safe , legal and rare .

" he is a highly successful , aggressive , populist politician but all throughout his career he has argued there is another side to him -- that there is a deep commitment to values -- and they are very traditional @entity249 values , " he told @entity240 's @entity239 . however , he added that while his values informed his political views , he was able to shift and adapt them to prevailing political reality .

" asked about the incident tuesday in an appearance with @entity80 foreign minister @entity79 in @entity81 , @entity4 foreign minister @entity76 said , " we still have not received an explanation . ... i am hopeful we will get an explanation . " he said the timing of the announcement was significant but did not elaborate . asked about the matter again following the news conference with @entity79 , @entity76 said , " i have already said everything . " assistant u.s. attorney @entity91 said search warrants in the case were being executed " across the country . " he called the initial criminal complaint " the tip of the iceberg . " " these people are trained together , " @entity91 said of the defendants . " at the core of this is deception . " separate hearings for the other detained suspects were expected later monday in other states . a @entity4 @entity107 spokesman said monday that he was unaware of the reports of the arrests , and said he was seeking more information from @entity4 officials . the suspects were " trained @entity4 intelligence operatives , " a @entity31 spokesman said , and information from court documents alleged they were part of a mission to plant " deep - cover " agents in the @entity8 . the @entity31 said the 10 people arrested and another person not yet in custody were supposed to recruit intelligence agents , but were not directly involved in obtaining @entity8 secrets themselves . all were charged with acting as agents of a foreign government , and nine also were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering . the charges include conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the @entity8 attorney general , a crime that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison , the @entity31 said . conspiracy to commit money laundering has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison . the case resulted from a " multiyear investigation " conducted by the @entity142 , the @entity143 for the @entity144 and the @entity31 's @entity145 , according to a @entity31 statement . the 11 suspects were charged in two separate criminal complaints . last week , president @entity149 and @entity4 president @entity150 spoke of strengthened ties between the former @entity66 foes after their meeting at the @entity154 . however , court documents and @entity31 officials described a @entity4 intelligence operation straight out of a 1950s spy novel . according to the court documents , some of the suspects adopted phony identities , including those of dead @entity8 , and posed as married couples . the suspects engaged in secret communications including exchanges of bags , money drops and use of invisible ink , as well as more modern touches such as private wireless computer networks between specific laptops , the documents said . a decrypted message from @entity179 to two of the suspects said they were sent to the @entity8 for " long - term service , " one of the documents said . " your education , bank accounts , car , house , etc. -- all these serve one goal : fulfill your main mission , i.e , to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in @entity8 and send intels ( intelligence reports ) , " the document said . the @entity4 operation was believed to date back to the 1990s , the court document said . it added that the @entity142 conducted extensive electronic surveillance of the suspects for years , including secretly recording and videotaping them and surreptitiously entering residences to take photographs and copy documents . one of the suspects is @entity208 , a columnist for " @entity43 " for more than 20 years covering politics , immigration and other issues , her lawyer confirmed . @entity208 is married to @entity212 , another of the suspects arrested monday , and the couple resided in @entity215 , a @entity40 suburb . @entity208 , @entity212 , @entity52 and two other suspects -- identified as @entity217 and @entity218 -- appeared in the @entity40 courtroom . the other suspects were identified in court documents as @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 . another suspect , @entity227 , was still being sought . @entity226 and @entity52 allegedly conducted the private wireless computer links to communicate with a @entity4 government official , one court document alleged . in one instance , @entity52 was in a bookshop and the @entity4 government official drove by in a van to make the wireless connection , the document said . another document described alleged efforts to secretly get money to the suspects to fund their clandestine activities , including money drops involving exchanged bags in public places and other subterfuge . in one incident , @entity18 , the suspect still at large , received money from a @entity4 agent and buried it in a park in northern @entity26 , the document said . @entity225 and @entity224 later showed up at the park to dig up the money , the document said . @entity1 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .	@entity26:Virginia	@entity212:Lazaro	@entity80:Israeli	@entity81:Jerusalem	@entity253:Jill Dougherty	@entity254:Carol Jordan	@entity255:Michael Schwartz	@entity256:Arkady Irshenko	@entity150:Dmitry Medvedev	@entity154:White House	@entity215:Yonkers	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity5:Cyprus	@entity4:Russia	@entity179:Moscow	@entity8:U.S.	@entity218:Cynthia Murphy	@entity52:Chapman	@entity79:Lieberman	@entity55:Russian Foreign Ministry	@entity76:Lavrov	@entity31:Justice Department	@entity13:Interpol	@entity11:Larnaca airport	@entity10:Robert Christopher Metsos	@entity18:Metsos	@entity217:Richard Murphy	@entity107:Embassy	@entity266:Foreign Ministry	@entity91:Farbiarz	@entity144:Southern District of New York	@entity145:National Security Division	@entity223:Tracey Lee Ann Foley	@entity222:Donald Howard Heathfield	@entity225:Mills	@entity224:Zottoli	@entity142:FBI	@entity143:U.S. Attorney 's Office	@entity226:Semenko	@entity149:Barack Obama	@entity208:Pelaez	@entity40:New York	@entity227:Christopher R.

every dollar spent on nuclear power is one less spent on renewable energy , says @placeholder	@entity186	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- if our nation wants to reduce global warming , air pollution and energy instability , we should invest only in the best energy options . nuclear energy is n't one of them . every dollar spent on nuclear is one less dollar spent on clean renewable energy and one more dollar spent on making the world a comparatively dirtier and a more dangerous place , because nuclear power and nuclear weapons go hand in hand . in the november issue of @entity26 , my colleague @entity22 of the @entity24 and i laid out a plan to power the world with nothing but wind , water and sun. after considering the best available technologies , we decided that a combination of wind , concentrated solar , geothermal , photovoltaics , tidal , wave and hydroelectric energy could more than meet all the planet 's energy needs , particularly if all the world 's vehicles could be run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells . we rejected nuclear for several reasons . first , it 's not carbon - free , no matter what the advocates tell you . vast amounts of fossil fuels must be burned to mine , transport and enrich uranium and to build the nuclear plant . and all that dirty power will be released during the 10 to 19 years that it takes to plan and build a nuclear plant . ( a wind farm typically takes two to five years . ) @entity62 says now is the time for nuclear power the on - the - ground footprint of nuclear power , through its plants and uranium mines , is about 1,000 times larger than it is for wind . wind turbines are merely poles in the ground -- with lots of space between them that can be farmed , ranched or left open -- or poles in the ocean . geothermal energy also has a much smaller footprint than nuclear ; solar only slightly more . but while geothermal , solar and wind are safe , nuclear is not . for nuclear to meet all the world 's energy needs today -- 12.5 terawatts ( 1 terawatt = 1 trillion watts ) -- more than 17,000 nuclear plants would be needed . even if nuclear were only 5 percent of the solution , most countries would have nuclear plants . what 's worse , the nuclear industry wants to reprocess waste to obtain more energy from increasingly scarce uranium . but this only produces more weapons - grade uranium and plutonium . a global push toward nuclear energy would mean that uranium enrichment -- and efforts at nuclear weapons development -- would certainly grow throughout the world . . nuclear proponents argue that not enough clean renewables exist to power the world . however , part of our work at @entity110 has been to map world renewable energy resources . enough wind and solar exist in high - wind and sunny locations over land to power the world for all purposes multiple times over . there is no shortage . nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant , unlike fickle winds and sunshine . but worldwide , nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time , and when a plant goes down , so does a large fraction of the grid . connecting wind farms over large areas through transmission lines smoothes power supply . combining geothermal with wind ( whose power potential often peaks at night ) and solar ( which peaks by day ) , and using hydroelectricity to fill in gaps , would almost always match demand . converting to electric vehicles and using smart charging practices would also help to match supply with demand . so would storing energy ( with concentrated solar ) and giving people incentives to reduce demand . it is not rocket science to match power demand . it merely requires thinking out of the box . finally , the costs of land - based wind , geothermal and hydroelectricity are competitive with conventional new sources of electricity ; costs of solar and wind over the ocean are higher but declining . costs of nuclear have historically been underestimated . in sum , if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables , you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait , and wait , for the nuclear age to arrive . we will also guarantee a riskier future for us all . there is no need for nuclear . the world can be powered by wind , water and sun alone . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .	@entity22:Mark DeLucchi	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:California	@entity0:Palo Alto	@entity26:Scientific American	@entity24:University of California-Davis	@entity186:Mark Jacobson	@entity110:Stanford University	@entity62:Stewart Brand

@entity13 's side face @entity113 after 1998 winners saw off @placeholder earlier on monday	@entity115	( @entity0 ) -- extra-time goals from @entity2 and @entity3 spared @entity5 's blushes against @entity6 in the @entity7 last 16 tie at @entity9 on monday . following 90 minutes of stalemate it was @entity13 's side who finally broke the deadlock in the second minute of extra time when @entity17 squared the ball for @entity3 to cleverly back heal the ball past goalkeeper @entity20 . @entity2 drilled in a shot to double the lead in the final minute of the second extra period before @entity24 pulled one back for @entity6 in injury time . it was a cruel end to what was a brave performance by @entity29 's side who were looking to settle an old score from the 1982 @entity7 . @entity6 were eliminated at the group stage at the tournament held in @entity34 after @entity5 and @entity35 contrived a result ( a 1 - 0 win to the @entity38 ) which guaranteed both @entity40 teams would qualify for the knockout stages . thirty - two years after the so - called " @entity43 " it was fitting that @entity6 's first last 16 match in the @entity7 was against @entity5 . spurred on by history , the @entity6 got off to a flying start and perhaps deserved more for their frequent early raids into the heart of the @entity38 defense . @entity50 served warning of @entity6 's threat in the eighth minute as he scampered unchallenged down the left after a @entity38 attack broke down . the danger was only averted when @entity56 rushed out of his area to tackle the @entity59 striker . nine minutes later @entity50 looked to have scored his third goal of the tournament when he headed in @entity63 's superb cross , but was adjudged to be offside -- tv replays showed the referee 's assistant had made the correct call . as the half wore on @entity5 came back into the game but were still vulnerable to the counter and were lucky when , in the 39th minute , @entity72 's thunderous 25 - yard drive ricocheted off the boot of defender @entity74 and bounced narrowly wide . moments later at the other end , @entity5 were denied themselves as @entity20 pulled off an amazing double save from @entity78 then @entity79 . @entity3 replaced @entity79 at the start of the second half -- a change which made @entity5 more purposeful in attack . in the 54th minute , @entity17 laid the ball on for captain @entity85 whose shot from 18 yards out produced an outstanding fingertip save from @entity20 . @entity6 's rampant forays forward were less frequent but no less alarming for the @entity5 's back four who continued to struggle with @entity50 's menacing runs . as the game entered the final 15 minutes of normal time it was @entity5 who increasingly looked likely to score . @entity17 looked certain to head in substitute @entity98 's cross in the 80th minute but could only fire straight at @entity20 and ten minutes later @entity99 missed the chance to head a late winner . @entity3 's 92nd minute strike calmed @entity38 nerves before @entity104 got them jangling again eight minutes later with a close range strike which went wide . but when @entity2 scored @entity5 's second in the 119th minute they were home and dry despite @entity24 's late goal . @entity13 's side can now look forward to a quarterfinal against @entity113 at the @entity114 on friday . read more : @entity113 sees off @entity115	@entity20:Mbolhi	@entity24:Djabou	@entity29:Vahid Halilhodzic	@entity115:Nigeria	@entity114:Maracana	@entity113:France	@entity85:Philipp Lahm	@entity35:Austria	@entity119:Porto Alegre	@entity3:Andre Schurrle	@entity2:Mesut Ozil	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:World Cup	@entity6:Algeria	@entity5:Germany	@entity9:Port Alegre	@entity50:Slimani	@entity79:Gotze	@entity56:Manuel Neuer	@entity74:Jerome Boateng	@entity59:Sporting Portugal	@entity78:Toni Kroos	@entity17:Muller	@entity13:Joachim Low	@entity34:Spain	@entity38:German	@entity104:Mehdi Mostefa	@entity99:Bastian Schweinsteiger	@entity98:Sami Khedira	@entity40:European	@entity43:Disgrace of Gijon	@entity72:Aissa Mandi	@entity63:El Arabi Soudani

" a big shame for the team -- and not an ideal scenario at all , " said @entity8 as he recalled the disastrous incident with @entity10 . " it can happen . he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and ... well , that was it . " there was a long way to go and i was not guaranteed to win , but it was an interesting few meters on the track between us . " @entity9 team boss @entity68 was not amused : " it was very disappointing . i need to talk to both drivers . we did everything right as a team , but they should never have been there , where they were . " it is bad for the team and we have lost a lot of points . i always ask them to give each other room , but we have handed the points on a plate to @entity4 now . " we saw @entity1 and @entity2 racing each other and giving each other space . that 's all we ask for .

" i do n't know what happened , but they collided and we got past them and we had a bit of a battle -- a fair one , i must say - before the end , " he said .

appeals court : @placeholder ca n't " take advantage " of an administrative error	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 must serve a year of probation after being convicted on check fraud charges , a @entity2 appeals court ruled tuesday . @entity8 can not " take advantage " of an administrative error to avoid serving the 2010 sentence , the appeals court ruled . the fifth @entity12 's ruling comes a day after @entity2 's attorney general filed a motion in the case . attorney general @entity16 argued that a clerical error should not prevent @entity8 from abiding by a judge 's verbal order . @entity8 " and her lawyers were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement , " the appeals court ruling said . @entity8 has been in seclusion since her july acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity3 , and her subsequent release from jail . @entity8 was convicted of felony check fraud for stealing a checkbook from a friend and writing five checks for $ 644.25 . a judge sentenced her in that case in january 2010 . @entity40 chief judge @entity39 ruled earlier this month that she had to report for probation on the bad - check charge by friday . the attorney general 's office wrote that @entity8 " upon her release ( july 17 ) , should have reported " for probation -- something she did not do . @entity8 's probation order requires her to live in @entity40 , @entity2 , unless the probation office allows her to leave . she has received no such approval , a corrections department spokeswoman has said . but @entity8 's attorneys have argued repeatedly that @entity8 should not have to return to serve her probation in @entity2 . in an emergency petition filed on wednesday with the same appeals court , @entity8 's defense team asked that the court overturn @entity39 's order before the required date . they also asked the appellate court to strip @entity39 of further jurisdiction in the case . @entity40 circuit judge @entity65 had earlier ordered @entity8 to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter , but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed , instructing that @entity8 would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial . the order was updated august 1 to add the words " upon release . " but @entity8 's lawyers contended that she could n't be required to serve probation , arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from @entity65 . serving the sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense , they argued . @entity39 ruled earlier this month that @entity65 's verbal order was binding -- a ruling the appeals court upheld tuesday .	@entity3:Casey Anthony	@entity2:Florida	@entity0:CNN	@entity12:District Court of Appeal	@entity16:Pamela Bondi	@entity39:Perry	@entity8:Anthony	@entity40:Orange County	@entity65:Strickland

" widespread " means that more than 50 % of geographic regions in a state -- counties , for example -- are reporting flu activity . it addresses the spread of the flu , not its severity . the new report uses data collected by the @entity4 up through january 12 . the overall number of people being treated in outpatient facilities appears to be going down , said dr. @entity24 , the @entity4 's director . however , in the @entity27 , where the flu season started later , the number of cases is expected to grow . hospitalizations for the elderly have also gone up significantly , according to the report . about 90 % of flu - related deaths occur in those over 65 . the @entity4 expects the number of hospitalizations and deaths to continue to rise . " it 's a worse than average ( flu ) season , and it 's a bad year for the elderly , " @entity24 said . nine additional pediatric deaths have been reported since last week , bringing the total since the flu season began to 29 . the @entity4 does not count the number of flu - related adult deaths . the @entity45 is about halfway through the typical 12 - week flu season , @entity24 said , but the agency is not sure when it will peak . " the only thing predictable about the flu is , it 's unpredictable .

@entity1 sprints to victory ahead of @entity13 's @placeholder	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 capped a superb week for @entity2 at the world cycling championships by winning the men 's road race title sunday with a trademark sprint finish . @entity1 , the pre-race favorite on a course well - suited to his talents , timed his burst to perfection to take gold from @entity13 's @entity12 with @entity14 of @entity15 taking the bronze medal . it was @entity2 's first men 's road race title since the legendary @entity20 won in 1965 and took them to the top of the medals table at the championships in @entity24 . they claimed two gold , two silvers and two bronze medals as their dominance in track cycling extended to the various road disciplines . @entity1 paid tribute to his teammates after they had paced him through the majority of the 260km race over 17 laps but with a tough uphill finish . " there could n't be any other result after the way the guys rode today , " @entity1 told @entity37 . " i 'm so proud . " an early breakaway gained nearly 10 minutes , but with @entity2 forcing the pace at the front , it was pulled back and the decisive action took place on the last lap. @entity49 hero @entity48 made a typical charge , but with time trial silver medalist @entity51 and the experienced @entity53 to the fore , @entity2 were able to nullify his attempt . in the uphill finish , it was the @entity13 who moved to the front , but @entity1 came through fast near the barriers and once he hit the front there was only one winner . @entity63 winner @entity12 closed on the line while @entity14 edged out @entity66 's @entity65 for the final podium spot .	@entity2:Britain	@entity1:Cavendish	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Australia	@entity12:Matthew Goss	@entity24:Copenhagen	@entity48:Thomas Voeckler	@entity20:Tom Simpson	@entity49:Tour de France	@entity53:David Millar	@entity51:Bradley Wiggins	@entity14:Greipel	@entity79:Denmark	@entity66:Switzerland	@entity74:Cavendish	@entity37:Eurosport	@entity65:Fabian Cancellara	@entity15:Germany	@entity63:Milan-San Remo	@entity73:Briton
he says a recent change in @placeholder policy allows them to remain in @entity45	@entity54	( @entity0 ) -- it was barely floating , perhaps minutes from sinking , a small skiff , washed up against an unforgiving cement breakwater . the flat - bottomed boat was homemade , cobbled together with no evident craftsmanship , from scarce and salvaged materials . it was about 14 feet long and 4 feet wide , with a hand - hewn pole for a mast and fallen sails that looked like burlap . as waves and a relentless tide drove it into the concrete wall , the boat was going under , surrendering to the ocean that had brought it to @entity20 , @entity21 . a small crowd had gathered . some were taking pictures . my wife and i asked what was happening . one in the group told us that some men came over from @entity30 in this boat the previous night . they had given themselves to the ocean and whatever fate their desperate journey might bring them . they had traveled nearly 200 miles , day and night , through rough and open waters , sailing this pitiful craft on pitiless seas . local security had found them , walking around , lost . they had no destination beyond @entity45 . they were picked up and turned over to @entity47 . we asked how many there were . someone in the group told us , " nine men risked their lives to come to the @entity54 on this . " what is exceptional about this story is that it is not exceptional . immigrants constantly risk not only their own lives , but also their children 's , for the economic opportunity we enjoy with indifference . while these men apparently were from @entity30 , covered by the decades - old " wet - foot - dry - foot " @entity30 immigration policy , a trickle of immigrants from @entity45 has suddenly become a flood of women and children , swamping our border security offices . tens of thousands of @entity73 and @entity74 have been drawn by the luster of an @entity54 economy we find tarnished . unlike those nine @entity30 men , however , these immigrants have an additional reason for coming : president @entity81 invited them here . as @entity85 explained in the @entity86 , " president @entity81 's @entity83 decree -- @entity83 , which allowed thousands of illegal immigrants to stay in this country if they came at a young age -- created , in effect , a magnet for young people to try to enter the @entity54 illegally . " this degree , announced in june 2012 , allows immigrant children to stay if they had been in the @entity54 continuously from june 2007 to june 2012 . some say , however , the decree has swept through @entity45 . according to the @entity101 , a recent leaked memo by @entity100 agents spoke of this wave of new immigrants , saying they were motivated to come now , in this surge , because they had heard of the change in @entity54 policy that would allow them to remain in @entity45 . @entity83 must have sounded like popular politics to this president , yet it was cruelty disguised as kindness . our president 's incompetence has created a humanitarian crisis : he has lured an endless stream of children and mothers to risk everything to travel here . we are a country divided today . the prevailing debate is what is wrong with @entity45 and who among us should be blamed for it . yesterday 's newcomers blame today 's arrivals . those who have already walked through the golden door of opportunity would ungenerously close it behind them . we confront each other over what we lack , forgetting the greatness we have built together and how much better we could still be . @entity136 demand too much of immigration reform . @entity138 demand too little . the stalemate serves both their political ambitions . and as we watch men risking their lives on what can barely be called a boat and children desperately throwing themselves across our borders , we harbor a shame : no immigration reform will pass @entity149 this year . perhaps both @entity136 and @entity138 should remember : once , many of our families , in either this or a previous incarnation , came here as immigrants , seeking a better life and freedom . imagine that you are one of the nine men on that boat . or a muddied child in the @entity161 . we may never be called upon to make those journeys , but what would each of us risk to live in the greatest country in human history ? much more , it appears , than our leaders would risk so we can keep living there . join us on @entity170 / @entity169 .	@entity20:Key Largo	@entity21:Florida	@entity81:Obama	@entity83:Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals	@entity85:Byron York	@entity86:Washington Examiner	@entity136:Democrats	@entity170:Facebook.com	@entity0:CNN	@entity54:U.S.	@entity74:Ecuadorians	@entity73:Guatemalans	@entity30:Cuban	@entity100:Border Patrol	@entity101:Washington Post	@entity172:Castellanos	@entity161:Rio Grande	@entity169:CNNOpinion	@entity149:Congress	@entity45:America	@entity47:U.S. Customs and Border Protection	@entity138:Republicans
@placeholder authorities say they ca n't get their hands on the suspects	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- a top judge has issued a special plea to the four suspects named in the killing of former @entity6 prime minister @entity5 killing to come before the court . judge @entity8 , the president of the @entity9 , said in an open letter to the four men accused in the 2005 attack that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or even participate in the trial proceedings without being present . @entity8 issued the statement after @entity6 authorities told him they have been unable so far to serve warrants on and arrest the accused . " we will conduct trials based on a firm presumption of innocence of the accused . the @entity26 shall never convict anybody unless guilt is established beyond any reasonable doubt , " he said . arrest warrants were issued for @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 . a highly placed source in the @entity6 army , who had correctly given @entity0 the names of the suspects previously , has said that all four belong to @entity39 , the @entity40 militant group . @entity5 , a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician , died when his motorcade was hit by a bomb in @entity45 on february 14 , 2005 . supporters say he was killed because of his opposition to @entity49 influence in @entity6 . his death prompted mass protests that led to the withdrawal of @entity49 troops from @entity6 , who had been in the country for nearly 30 years . @entity8 defended the tribunal , saying its personnel " are doing their job with full independence and impartiality . " " we are only acting in the interest of @entity6 ; our only motivation is the pursuit of justice . our exclusive aim is to find the truth about the assassination of 14 february 2005 and other possibly connected criminal cases , while upholding the highest international standards of criminal law .

" if you believe this @entity26 is illegal or illegitimate , argue this point through legal counsel chosen by you -- you will thus have your voice heard on this issue . use your counsel to make your case and zealously protect your rights .

" for obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on those changes . the majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption , " a spokesman said .

@entity8 is due to testify in the trial of @entity5 ex-president @placeholder	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- the defense in the war crimes trial of former @entity5 president @entity4 filed an emergency motion to delay supermodel @entity8 's testimony against him , the court announced monday . she is scheduled to take the stand against him at the @entity13 for @entity14 on thursday . prosecutors say @entity4 gave her a diamond during the brutal war in @entity14 , contradicting @entity4 's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict . the defense says it has n't seen a copy of her testimony , which interferes with @entity4 's right to a fair trial . under tribunal rules , the defense team should get advance access to prosecution witness testimony so it can prepare its arguments . it asked the court to decide by wednesday whether @entity8 would testify thursday , according to court papers . @entity8 did not want to be involved in the trial but was subpoenaed on july 1 to appear at the tribunal for @entity4 , who faces war crimes charges over a brutal conflict in @entity14 that was fueled by rough diamonds , also known as blood diamonds or conflict diamonds . witnesses have said @entity4 gave @entity8 a diamond . prosecutors had rested their case against @entity4 in february 2009 . they asked to reopen it specifically to call @entity8 , as well as actress @entity47 and a witness named @entity49 , court papers show . prosecutors said they learned in june 2009 that @entity4 had given the supermodel a diamond in @entity54 in 1997 . @entity47 confirmed it , they said . when arguing to reopen the case , prosecutors said @entity8 's testimony would prove that the former president " used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases , " according to papers filed with the @entity65 - backed court . @entity4 , 62 , was president of @entity5 from 1997 to 2003 . the war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder , rape and mutilation that occurred during the bloody civil war in @entity14 . it was fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill , given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior , and often instructed to rape and plunder . @entity4 is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , sexual slavery and violence , and enslavement . he also faces five counts of war crimes , including acts of terrorism and torture , and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law . he has pleaded not guilty to the charges . @entity0 's @entity94 contributed to this report	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Special Tribunal	@entity5:Liberian	@entity4:Taylor	@entity8:Campbell	@entity65:U.N.	@entity14:Sierra Leone	@entity47:Farrow	@entity94:Carol Jordan	@entity49:Carole Taylor	@entity54:South Africa
@entity10 disputes with @placeholder has seen @entity86 nations wary of the company	@entity53	( @entity0 ) -- riding through the streets of @entity3 or flipping through channels of @entity6 tv , it 's difficult to escape messages from the country 's natural gas monopoly , @entity10 . @entity6 prime minister @entity11 visits the central control room at the @entity13 , @entity3 , january . " i 'm driving under a huge @entity10 sign right now , " @entity14 , vice-president of @entity15 , the @entity6 business news wire , said in a phone interview . television ad campaigns have promoted the company as a " national treasure " and , more recently , the business that makes " dreams come true . " " it can make someone think , why does a @entity6 monopoly need this kind of branding ? after all , there are other state - owned companies that do n't present themselves as a symbol of @entity6 , " @entity14 said . " but @entity10 is not just any company . " if the @entity34 promoted its interests through satellite states and military prowess , @entity6 today flexes its might on the global stage through its vast oil and natural gas fields . and no company exemplifies this more than @entity10 . " by reputation , it is the largest and most powerful @entity6 company , " said @entity43 , an analyst with @entity44 in @entity3 . watch @entity10 chief @entity47 explain future strategy ¬ª but its strong - arm tactics in contract negotiations with the @entity53 -- shutting off gas supplies three times in the past four years at the height of winter -- have @entity58 customers looking for alternatives to their reliance on @entity6 natural gas . the company has the world 's largest distribution system of gas , maintaining 97,560 miles ( 157,000 kilometers ) of pipelines that stretch , like @entity6 , from the @entity67 to @entity68 . the perennial conflict with the @entity53 -- through which much of the natural gas supply of @entity68 flows -- is of deep concern to nations such as @entity73 and @entity74 , which depend on @entity6 for up to 50 percent and 90 percent of their natural gas , respectively . @entity10 saw its market share in the @entity58 drop in the second half of 2008 . gas exports from @entity6 to @entity68 dropped 33 percent in october alone , according @entity44 . " the @entity53 conflict may have served as a catalyst for @entity86 customers to become more averse to @entity6 gas imports , " says a @entity44 report on the @entity53 crisis . the @entity6 economy , reliant on commodities , is suffering because of the fluctuating oil market , down from its record of nearly $ 150 a barrel to about $ 60 today . as a result , @entity10 saw profits fall 84 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , prompting the company to slash its dividend by 86 percent , to 11 cents a share . @entity6 has 20 percent of the world 's gas reserves , and is the single - largest producer of natural gas . @entity10 posted profits of $ 30.8 billion last year -- down from $ 40 billion the year before -- and its business alone accounts for 10 percent of @entity6 's gross domestic product . so it 's no surprise that @entity10 is a pet project of @entity6 prime minister @entity11 . his replacement as president , @entity109 , is a former chairman of the company . @entity11 's " interest in @entity10 is very deep . as a journalist who writes about energy issues , i 've seen him give very detailed information and knowledge about what 's happening with the company and company logistics , " said @entity14 of @entity15 . " when you hear him speak , it 's like you 're not talking to the prime minister of @entity6 , but one of the top company managers . " @entity47 , deputy chief executive officer of @entity124 , deflects questions about the perception that @entity10 is a tool of @entity6 government and energy policy . @entity130 explain @entity10 's plans ¬ª " nobody is challenging the view that @entity10 is a very special company , that we have a mixed capital structure , the majority of our shares are in the hands of the @entity6 government , " he said . " but the rest are in the hands of private shareholders , including private citizens all around the world .

" the @entity16 thing was a wake - up call on a number of fronts , " said @entity19 , a former @entity29 military and defense attache in @entity1 . " things they expected to perform well did n't -- communications , the air force . it took five days , which is quite a long time , to suppress another country 's air defenses , quite a small country 's . " @entity3 said the " most important task is to re-equip the [ @entity1 ] @entity44 with newest weapons system , " in televised remarks to defense ministry officials . he said the process had already begun and would accelerate through 2011 . @entity3 insisted that falling prices for oil and gas -- which contribute significantly to @entity0 's budget -- would not force him to scale back on plans to modernize the military . the defense budget has " virtually remained the same as was planned , " @entity3 said , " despite our current financial problems . " the country will aim for 70 percent of its weaponry to be " modern " by 2020 , defense minister @entity58 said , according to @entity61 , the state - run news agency . @entity1 invaded @entity16 , to its south , in august of last year -- the first time @entity1 military forces had engaged in an offensive outside their borders since the collapse of the @entity24 in 1991 . the conflict strengthened the hand of @entity3 , who favors reform , against generals who oppose it , @entity19 , the military analyst , told @entity2 .

@entity8 visits @placeholder on thursday to throngs of cheering crowds	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- has the new president turned around @entity3 's image in other countries ? you could call it step one , with many more to go . then - candidate @entity8 gave a major speech in @entity10 , @entity11 , in july of 2008 . in 2004 , president @entity12 visited @entity13 and faced massive protests and shouts of " @entity12 go home ! " but on thursday , president @entity8 got a different reception when he crossed the northern border : adoring throngs of @entity13 shouting , " yes we can ! " the new president vowed during the campaign to remake the image of the @entity3 in the world . last summer , for example , candidate @entity8 traveled to @entity24 and addressed thousands in @entity10 , @entity11 . " in @entity24 , the view that @entity3 is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common , " @entity8 said when he spoke not far from what was once the @entity26 . but the public relations blitz that began during the campaign wo n't be limited to @entity24 in the @entity8 administration , as secretary of state @entity35 demonstrated when she traveled to @entity36 this week . " we 're reaching out to the entire world , " she said in @entity37 . " it 's not only the @entity42 countries that feel like the @entity3 has been absent . " watch more of @entity44 's trip to @entity36 ¬ª a survey released by the @entity46 in december indicates that between 2002 and 2008 , favorable opinion of the @entity3 declined in 14 out of the 19 countries polled . in @entity37 , where @entity44 visited wednesday and where @entity8 spent part of his childhood , favorable opinion of the @entity3 plummeted from 61 percent to just 37 percent . @entity3 appear confident that world opinion can change under the new president . last year , when @entity12 was president , only 24 percent of @entity3 believed world leaders respected the @entity3 president , according to a recent @entity55 poll . now that @entity8 is in office , two - thirds of @entity3 believe the president is respected by world leaders . but @entity3 do n't think global attitudes toward the @entity3 have shifted significantly . just 45 percent of @entity3 now believe the country rates favorably in the eyes of the world , @entity55 found . that 's only two points higher than last year . @entity3 and the rest of the world are waiting to see what kinds of policy changes president @entity8 will make . watch more on @entity8 's visit to @entity13 ¬ª the biggest change so far ? closing the detention center at @entity72 , @entity73 . more changes have been promised . " this is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the @entity79 , " @entity8 said in @entity10 . he also promised action on climate change . " this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet , " he said in the same speech . @entity13 -- where on thursday @entity8 made his first foreign trip as president -- is one country where opinion may be shifting in @entity3 's favor . just 36 percent of @entity13 say their country 's relationship with the @entity3 has been good during the last couple of years , according to a recent @entity98 / @entity97 - @entity96 survey . but more than twice that many -- 74 percent -- expect relations to be good in coming years . however , there are some thorny problems ahead for the two countries , particularly regarding @entity103 . @entity8 has announced he will send an additional 17,000 @entity3 troops to that country . but when @entity13 were asked about extending their own troops ' mission in @entity103 , they were opposed by nearly 2 to 1 . the world loves @entity8 . but does the world love the @entity3 ? that relationship still needs some work .	@entity26:Berlin Wall	@entity24:Europe	@entity113:Schneider	@entity13:Canada	@entity3:Americans	@entity0:CNN	@entity11:Germany	@entity8:Obama	@entity10:Berlin	@entity79:Middle East	@entity55:Gallup	@entity73:Cuba	@entity72:Guantanamo Bay	@entity35:Hillary Clinton	@entity12:Bush	@entity37:Indonesia	@entity36:Asia	@entity103:Afghanistan	@entity98:Canadian Press	@entity97:Harris	@entity96:Decima	@entity44:Clinton	@entity46:Pew Global Attitudes Project	@entity42:ASEAN
@placeholder and @entity36 are only @entity3 carriers that fly affected planes	@entity53	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 ordered @entity3 airlines thursday to replace a part that has come under suspicion in the crash of @entity6 . @entity3 air safety authorities have ordered the replacement of a part on @entity11 planes following the crash of @entity6 . the @entity1 gave airlines 120 days to replace devices that could be giving false airspeed indications . all 228 people on @entity6 were killed when the @entity11 plane crashed june 1 en route to @entity18 , @entity19 , from @entity20 , @entity21 . the @entity3 air safety watchdog agency bypassed the usual process which allows for public comment on its orders . it said it could expedite the process because of the limited number of planes involved -- only 43 in the @entity3 -- and because they say it is prudent to make the change as quickly as possible . at the same time , it said it did not feel the risk warranted grounding the fleet of aircraft . @entity36 , one of only two @entity3 carriers who fly planes affected by the order , said thursday they had already replaced the part . " the work was completed last week . we are scheduled to take delivery of three new ... @entity49 by year 's end and those three will not require any ... changes , " a @entity36 spokesman told @entity47 via e-mail . @entity53 is the other @entity3 carrier that operates @entity54 , the @entity1 said . a spokeswoman for @entity57 airlines , @entity53 's parent company , said affected @entity53 planes are getting new parts . " we are well under way working closely with @entity11 and @entity64 to install the @entity64 pitot tubes within the required timelines , " @entity61 told @entity47 . the devices under suspicion are the @entity69 pitot probes on some @entity11 and @entity71 aircraft . they measure " ram air pressure , " the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed . the @entity1 order requires aircraft operators to replace certain @entity69 pitot probes with certain @entity64 or newer - design @entity69 pitot probes . the @entity1 says the order is intended to " prevent airspeed discrepancies , which could lead to disconnect of the autopilot and / or auto - thrust functions and consequent increased pilot workload . " @entity19 authorities are still investigating the cause of the @entity92 crash . but tests conducted since the crash have brought into question the performance of the pitot tubes and authorities say there have been reports of other malfunctions on flights . no @entity3 operator flies @entity103 . there are 302 of the aircraft worldwide . the @entity1 action follows an announcement by @entity109 air safety authorities earlier this week to require pitot tube replacements by september 7 .	@entity20:Rio de Janeiro	@entity21:Brazil	@entity3:U.S.	@entity1:FAA	@entity0:WASHINGTON	@entity6:Air France Flight 447	@entity53:Northwest	@entity57:Delta	@entity54:A330s	@entity71:A340	@entity11:Airbus A330	@entity36:US Airways	@entity19:French	@entity18:Paris	@entity103:A340s	@entity109:European	@entity92:Air France	@entity47:CNN	@entity69:Thales	@entity64:Goodrich	@entity49:A330s	@entity61:Ashley Black
@entity3 says he wants to go to the @placeholder to " recuperate "	@entity8	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the diplomatic drama over @entity3 showed promising signs of a resolution friday , with @entity6 indicating the activist could apply to travel to the @entity8 and @entity9 announcing it has invited him to be a visiting scholar . @entity6 was incensed after @entity3 , who broke out of house arrest , sought refuge at the @entity14 in @entity0 . he left the embassy after six days and went to a hospital , where he was reunited with his wife and their two children . since then , he has made several pleas to be allowed to leave @entity6 , including a call to a @entity8 congressional hearing . @entity6 's decision to allow @entity3 to travel abroad to study was seen as a significant sign of progress in what has been a thorny and controversial impasse . " as a @entity6 citizen , he may apply like other @entity6 citizens according to the laws and normal procedures of the relevant departments , " said @entity28 , a spokesman for the @entity29 . secretary of state @entity35 said the @entity8 was " encouraged " by @entity28 's statement . " from the beginning , all of our efforts with mr. @entity3 have been guided by his choices and our values , and i 'm pleased that today our ambassador has spoken with him again , our embassy staff and our doctor had a chance to meet with him , and he confirms that he and his family now want to go to the @entity8 so he can pursue his studies , " she told reporters in @entity0 . @entity9 said friday it has invited @entity3 to be a visiting scholar , working with its law programs . @entity3 would be in @entity53 or one of the university 's global sites , the university said in a statement , adding that the blind activist , 40 , has " long - established relationships " with faculty at the @entity60 . @entity62 spokeswoman @entity61 earlier said @entity3 had been offered a fellowship from an @entity8 university , where he could be accompanied by his wife and children . " the @entity6 government has indicated that it will accept mr. @entity3 's applications for appropriate travel documents , " @entity61 said . " the @entity8 government expects that the @entity6 government will expeditiously process his applications for these documents , and make accommodations for his current medical condition . the @entity8 government would then give visa requests for him and his immediate family priority attention . " @entity8 ambassador to @entity6 @entity77 , who spoke with @entity3 by phone for 20 minutes , said @entity3 told him he wants to travel to the @entity8 for study , senior @entity8 officials said . the @entity8 officials said that as long as @entity3 has a legitimate offer from an accredited institution and is serious about studying in the @entity8 , he would be given a student visa . " we believe steps will play out expeditiously , " one @entity8 official said . the news that embassy staff had an opportunity to meet with @entity3 underscores the progress in the case . @entity3 had said early friday that @entity8 @entity14 officials had told him @entity6 security personnel stopped @entity8 diplomats from entering his hospital room thursday . he is in a @entity0 hospital for treatment of a foot injury suffered during his escape . but the embassy staff and doctor met with @entity3 at the hospital for 45 minutes , the senior @entity8 officials said . friday was the 10th birthday of @entity3 's son , and embassy staff brought him presents . @entity104 's long - planned visit to @entity0 for strategic and economic talks became dominated by a flurry of negotiations between @entity6 and @entity8 officials over the @entity3 case . the diplomatic headache came just months before a presidential election in the @entity8 and a once - in - a - decade change of leadership in @entity6 . the uproar prompted sharp @entity116 criticism of the @entity118 administration as soft on autocratic governments that abuse their citizens , and it has touched a nerve politically . in one remarkable development , @entity3 called into a congressional hearing thursday chaired by @entity125 rep. @entity125 of @entity126 . " @entity6 pledged to guarantee my constitutional rights and called me a free man , " @entity3 said , speaking from his hospital room early friday in @entity0 to congressional commission members who listened by speakerphone in @entity130 , 12 times zones and thousands of miles away . " i want them to keep their commitment by allowing me to travel abroad to recuperate , " he said . " i want to go to the @entity8 and rest for a while , since i have n't had a sunday in seven years . " the @entity6 comments came as @entity8 diplomats spoke with @entity3 in the hospital . the officials also met with @entity3 's wife , @entity142 , according to a senior @entity62 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter . @entity104 was due to leave @entity6 on saturday for @entity146 . it remains unclear whether a fresh deal over @entity3 's future will take shape before she departs . @entity3 , @entity152 rewriting @entity6 's script @entity3 said he was worried about his relatives in his hometown in the eastern province of @entity157 , which he fled last month . he said he has not been able to contact some of them and blamed local @entity6 officials for his living situation there . " they have installed seven surveillance cameras in my house , " he said . " in addition to have the guards stay in my place , they are building an electric fence around my house . they even scoffed , ' let 's see what this blind guy can do to us . ' " in a telephone interview with @entity1 , @entity3 expressed optimism that @entity8 officials would act on his behalf . " i believe they will help me , " he said . until last month , @entity3 had been forcibly confined to his home for 18 months after serving four years in prison , apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions and sterilizations by @entity6 's family planning officials . when @entity3 left the embassy , @entity8 officials announced that they had worked out a deal with @entity6 for his future and that @entity3 was leaving of his own free will . the officials said the @entity6 government had committed to relocate @entity3 to a " safe environment " away from the province where he and his family say they had suffered brutal treatment by local authorities . in addition , the officials said , @entity6 agreed to investigate those allegations of mistreatment and promised @entity3 would face no further legal issues . under the agreement , @entity3 was to be granted the opportunity to pursue university studies in the safe location . @entity77 said one of the proposals " allowed for the possible transfer some day to an @entity8 college or university . " but @entity3 subsequently indicated he regretted having abandoned the embassy and made pleas through @entity1 and other international news organizations to @entity8 leaders to get him out of @entity6 . his statements prompted bewildered reactions from @entity8 officials , who reiterated that the decision to leave the embassy was @entity3 's and that he had repeatedly said he wished to remain in @entity6 . did @entity118 betray a @entity6 hero ? on friday , @entity3 mollified his tone compared with the comments he made a day earlier , when he said he was " very disappointed " in the @entity8 government because he felt @entity8 officials had lobbied for him to leave the embassy and abandoned him at the hospital . instead , he expressed " deep gratitude " to @entity8 officials in @entity0 for having treated him " extremely well " during his six - day stay in the embassy . @entity231 , an @entity8 law professor and friend of @entity3 , offered an explanation for @entity3 's statements after he left the embassy . " everything changed when he got to the hospital , " said @entity231 , who advised @entity3 by phone while he was inside the embassy . " all of a sudden , the people who had worked so hard to secure his future from our embassy and our @entity62 , they were tired as can be and they went home to sleep . " @entity3 is " in a very fragile emotional state , " @entity231 said . " you have to understand the enormous pressures in which he 's been living and recently operating . and it got to be too much . " @entity3 's case has touched a nerve in @entity6 . comments from @entity6 officials reported by state media have criticized what they call " interference " by @entity130 . @entity231 said he is hopeful a deal can be reached to get @entity3 out of @entity6 . " they 're practical people , " he said , referring to @entity6 's leaders . " they 're going to want to get rid of him and his family in the most humane appearance possible . " human rights advocacy groups , meanwhile , questioned whether @entity0 would stick to its promises about @entity3 's future , noting that several of his friends and family members have been detained or are unaccounted for . visitors unwelcome in @entity3 's hometown one of those friends -- the fellow activist who revealed @entity3 's dramatic escape to @entity1 last week -- reappeared friday after being missing for a week . @entity272 had been unreachable since she told a @entity8 - based human rights organization that the @entity6 security services had arrived at her home . on friday , she said by phone , " i just got home and i 'm doing ok . " she declined to comment further . @entity279 , a @entity282 - based @entity281 human rights organization , said it remained concerned about @entity3 's relatives and other human rights figures in @entity6 . " the fight for freedom and rights continues , " said @entity285 , @entity279 's president " @entity0 gives @entity3 freedom with one hand and beats rights defenders with the other . " @entity1 's @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 contributed to this report .	@entity28:Liu	@entity29:Chinese Foreign Ministry	@entity116:Republican	@entity279:ChinaAid	@entity152:Bo	@entity272:He Peirong	@entity130:Washington	@entity118:Obama	@entity3:Chen	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Beijing	@entity6:Chinese	@entity157:Shandong	@entity9:New York University	@entity8:United States	@entity53:New York	@entity298:Jethro Mullen	@entity299:Stan Grant	@entity294:Jaime FlorCruz	@entity295:Steven Jiang	@entity77:Locke	@entity297:Eunice Yoon	@entity293:Jill Dougherty	@entity14:Embassy	@entity35:Hillary Clinton	@entity231:Cohen	@entity104:Clinton	@entity126:New Jersey	@entity125:Chris Smith	@entity296:Dan Lothian	@entity146:Bangladesh	@entity142:Yuan Weijing	@entity282:Texas	@entity281:Christian	@entity285:Bob Fu	@entity62:State Department	@entity60:NYU School of Law	@entity61:Nuland
@placeholder : @entity22 should use lessons of @entity5 as a guide	@entity190	( @entity0 ) -- on june 17 , 1964 , president @entity1 explained to the @entity3 reporter @entity2 why he had to stay the course in @entity5 by stabilizing the @entity7 government so that it could fight communism . @entity1 rejected calls for withdrawal that were being made by liberal democrats as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by @entity16 's @entity15 . " so the only thing you 've got left , " @entity1 said , " is try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and hold as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and that we 're doing day and night . " during his recent speech at @entity24 , president @entity22 rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about @entity28 . the president , saying that the comparison with @entity5 relies on a " false reading of history , " pointed to three differences . the first is that the @entity34 is now part of a broad international coalition . the second is that in @entity5 the @entity34 faced a " broad - based popular insurgency " whereas today , according to most polls , a large number of @entity28 support foreign assistance . @entity42 , @entity22 added , is that today @entity34 are responding to a very real threat that began with the vicious attack on 9/11 . clearly , @entity22 feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undercut liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision . in trying to separate himself from the experience of @entity1 , however , @entity22 did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently , and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today . @entity58 once said that history does not repeat itself , but it rhymes . most of those who have compared @entity28 to @entity5 do not say that the situations were exactly the same politically or strategically . nor is it inevitable that the surge in @entity28 will be unsuccessful . the point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that @entity22 faces similar challenges , as did @entity1 when the " @entity70 " of @entity5 began in the spring of 1965 . both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many top advisers in the @entity75 and in @entity76 were strongly warning against escalation . in 1964 , @entity1 heard from voices ranging from @entity80 liberal @entity79 to @entity82 hawk @entity81 that @entity5 was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable . their warnings proved to be accurate . going into this decision , @entity22 heard comparable criticism as well . both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda . @entity1 was much further ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war that he inherited . the war devastated @entity1 's domestic efforts . @entity22 faces the same threat . both wars have been justified as wars of necessity . with @entity5 , proponents warned that the fall of @entity104 to communism would vastly strengthen the @entity106 and @entity107 . in an era when @entity34 schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war , this warning about @entity5 also made the war seem essential . today , the necessity stems from the claim that failure would resurrect the dangers we faced before 9/11 . and both presidents escalated wars where the path to victory and the potential costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear . despite the fact that @entity1 confronted a very different kind of enemy , the risk today is enormously high . in @entity28 , the @entity34 is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous , as the @entity106 learned in the 1980s and the @entity34 has learned since 2001 . the @entity34 is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in @entity28 . while the promise of withdrawal in july 2011 might be accurate , presidential assurances of benchmarks and end games historically do n't come true . the one constant in warfare is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control . one day after @entity22 's speech , defense secretary @entity143 indicated that the deadline was not firm . and the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the @entity151 would mean . these warnings will make it difficult in the long run for the administration to contain the operation or to withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the @entity151 has been defeated . democrats could find themselves feeling like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the containment arguments outlined by president @entity166 with the @entity167 in 1947 -- first with @entity168 in 1950 and then with @entity5 . @entity22 should not be so defensive about the comparisons with @entity5 . rather , he should use @entity1 's experience to help guide him as he makes crucial decisions in the months ahead and attempts to navigate the challenges of the wartime presidency . in a conversation with a few of his closest advisers , @entity1 said in 1964 that " it 's damned easy to get in a war but it 's gon na be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in . " in 1965 , @entity1 made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war . let 's hope that this time around @entity22 does not repeat this error . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .	@entity22:Obama	@entity24:West Point	@entity28:Afghanistan	@entity80:Idaho	@entity81:Richard Russell	@entity82:Georgia	@entity151:Taliban	@entity3:New York Times	@entity2:James " Scotty " Reston	@entity1:Johnson	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:South Vietnamese	@entity5:Vietnam	@entity190:Zelizer	@entity79:Frank Church	@entity75:White House	@entity76:Congress	@entity70:Americanization	@entity16:France	@entity15:Charles de Gaulle	@entity34:U.S.	@entity104:Southeast Asia	@entity106:Soviets	@entity107:China	@entity58:Mark Twain	@entity166:Harry Truman	@entity167:Truman Doctrine	@entity143:Robert Gates	@entity168:Korea	@entity42:Last

" this race now will be the highest - profile test of what 's happening in the @entity6 , the struggle over whether you fight and compromise or do you fight and keep fighting . this race will capture huge national attention , " @entity53 added . @entity19 says he 's not surprised he 's being challenged . " she 's been traveling around @entity3 for a long time , so i 'm not surprised . i 'm only surprised in that she said if i ran she would n't . she announced 30 minutes after i more specifically stated my intention , " @entity19 told @entity0 chief congressional correspondent @entity103 on wednesday . and he pushed back on his age , telling bash , " i 'm absolutely not too old to be a senator . i 'm about the median age for this body . i 'm in really good health , i 'm on the committees that i want to be on . i have seniority . " and @entity19 does n't think his ability to work with @entity118 is a liability , saying " i 've developed trust on both sides of the aisle , people trust me that what i say i 'm going to do , i do . " on tuesday @entity19 told reporters that he would n't change his plans to run for a fourth term , but admitted to reporters that fundraising has " always been a problem for me . " but he told @entity107 that people in @entity3 " complain about long campaigns . it does n't take them long to make up their mind . and it does n't cost a lot of money to have them make up their mind . " @entity19 appears to have the backing of the two other members of @entity3 's congressional delegation . " i think that @entity19 has done an excellent job representing the people of @entity3 and i 'm going to continue to work to support @entity19 , sen. @entity141 told @entity0 on wednesday . " i have a great deal of respect for the entire @entity10 family , for the vice president , for @entity13 and for @entity149 , but i think it 's the wrong race at the wrong time , " he said . @entity152 rep. @entity152 of @entity3 ripped @entity10 's decision as " bad form " and predicted she would lose in the @entity6 primary next year . " i do n't know that anybody can out - conservative @entity19 , " @entity152 told @entity0 senior congressional producer @entity155 and other reporters outside the @entity158 chamber on tuesday . the congresswoman , @entity3 's at - large representative , admitted @entity10 had the upper hand in raising money , but said that would n't matter . " she will outraise him by factors of 10 or more , and he will still win because @entity3 is grassroots , retail campaigning , " she said . the @entity168 was quick to say it stands firmly behind @entity19 , the @entity6 incumbent . " our mission is to re-elect our incumbents and build a @entity6 majority , " @entity168 communications director @entity169 told @entity0 . @entity10 , who chairs a nonprofit on national security and education called @entity177 , had been rumored this year to be considering a @entity2 run . early last week , former sen. @entity179 of @entity3 told the @entity180 that a potential @entity10 primary challenge would bring about " the destruction of the @entity6 of @entity3 , " adding that , " it 's a disaster -- a divisive , ugly situation -- and all it does is open the door for the @entity118 for 20 years . " @entity186 had a different message after @entity10 's announcement on tuesday . " i deeply care about them both , " he said , according to the @entity189 . @entity10 will come under attack for being a carpetbagger . she was born in @entity194 and grew up in @entity197 's @entity196 suburbs before attending college in @entity199 and law school in @entity201 . she spent most of her career working in the nation 's capital before moving to @entity3 last year . @entity10 touted her family 's longtime @entity3 roots in a speech in may and in her announcement tuesday . he highlighted that her family " first came here in 1852 , in search of religious freedom , " adding that her grandmother " was raised in the @entity210 oil field and grew up to become @entity212 's first female deputy sheriff . " will the carpetbagger tag stick ? there have already been comparisons to @entity221 . in 2000 the first lady , who grew up in @entity201 and lived for many years in @entity223 , successfully ran for the @entity2 in @entity224 , but faced the carpetbagger attacks . " what did @entity221 have ? she had national name identification . she had a giant fundraising network , she had a bunch of people willing to work for her and willing to fight and she ran a very effective campaign and she won , " @entity53 recalled . as for @entity10 , he said , " she will have money . she has the name identification . now the test is , since she 's new to politics , can she run a campaign . can she convince the people of @entity3 that she 's right .

" we 're going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff to make the ( school ) facilities even better than they already are , " @entity5 said . he said there is " no better way " to honor @entity1 's life than by doing something on behalf of others . " there 's nobody who ca n't serve , nobody who ca n't help somebody else , " he said . " whether you 're 7 , or 6 , or whether you 're 76 , you can find the opportunity to make an enormous amount of difference in your community .

" we must be reminded as to why dr. @entity1 has been the one to deserve such a monument and such a holiday , " @entity70 said . " ... what he did was hold a banner of freedom and equality that actually transformed this nation . " on sunday , park rangers also placed wreaths at the memorial . members of @entity1 's family stood beside the towering 30 - foot statue of him as crowds sang " @entity90 " at a ceremony . " we 're celebrating the best of what we are , but also what we must become , knowing that we 've not arrived there yet , " @entity91 said . on the civil rights leader 's birthday -- january 15 , 1968 -- @entity1 was planning a " poor people 's campaign " to bring together @entity41 from all walks of life to demand " decent jobs with decent pay , " his son said . " he did not live to see that come to fruition , and so , 44 years later , we 're still challenging our nation , particularly in light of the fact that there 's so much poverty rampant in this nation , " @entity91 said . the @entity1 memorial in @entity9 opened to the public last year . sunday 's ceremony came several days after officials confirmed that a controversial quote on one side of the monument would be corrected . the line currently reads : " i was a drum major for justice , peace and righteousness . " the quote , which holds a prominent place among more than a dozen @entity1 's most notable lines at the site , sparked controversy last summer when poet @entity130 said it made the civil rights leader appear arrogant . @entity1 's original words , from a 1968 sermon at @entity134 in @entity135 , were : " if you want to say that i was a drum major , say that i was a drum major for justice . say that i was a drum major for peace . i was a drum major for righteousness . and all of the other shallow things will not matter .

@entity0 says she was sentenced to prison in @placeholder after reporting she was raped	@entity3	@entity1 interior designer @entity0 has spoken out after being handed a 16 - month prison sentence in @entity3 -- after she went to police to report she had been raped by a colleague . the 24 - year - old was convicted and sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex , making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol . her story is dominating the headlines in @entity1 , and has raised serious questions over the way women who allege sexual assault are treated in the @entity18 . @entity0 , who had been working at an interior design firm in @entity20 since september 2011 , told @entity21 on saturday how a work trip to @entity3 in march with three colleagues turned into a nightmare . she said she had been out at a bar with her colleagues and friends , and asked a male colleague to walk her to her room when they returned at 3 a.m. to the hotel . she 'd asked him to escort her because the hotel was large and confusing , and she did n't want to be wandering on her own , knowing she 'd been drinking , she said . when they reached a room , she realized it was n't hers -- but the man then pulled her inside despite her vocal objections , according to @entity0 . " he dragged me by my purse in , so i thought , ' ok , i just need to calm the situation down . i will finish my bottle of water , i will sit here and then i will excuse myself and say i feel fine , ' " she said . that was pretty much the last thing she said she remembers before the alleged sexual assault . " i woke up with my clothes off , sleeping on my belly , and he was raping me . i tried to get off , i tried to get him off , but he pushed me back down . " after someone knocked -- the hotel wake - up call -- she managed to get dressed and make it downstairs to the hotel reception , @entity0 said . " i called the police . that is what you do . we are trained on that from when we are very young , " she said . some 10 or 12 male police officers arrived , but no female police officers were present , she said . statements were taken from both @entity0 and the alleged rapist . she was then taken to @entity3 police station , she said . 6 men convicted of raping @entity68 tourist in @entity69 after again giving her version of events to officers , @entity0 said , " they asked me , ' are you sure you called the police because you just did n't like it ? ' i said , ' well of course i did n't like it . ' that is when i knew , i do n't think they are going to believe me at all . " @entity0 says she was taken for an intimate medical exam and tested for alcohol consumption . her belongings were taken and she was kept in jail for four days , she said , with no explanation as to why . @entity3 police and @entity18 government officials have not responded to repeated @entity21 requests for comment . @entity0 said she managed to call her parents on the third day to tell them she had been raped and ask them to contact the @entity1 embassy . a day later , a representative from the @entity1 consulate came to the police station and she was released -- but her passport was not returned . a piece of paper with @entity97 text was handed to her , she said . an @entity97 speaker told her it listed two charges against her : one for sex outside of marriage and the other for public consumption of alcohol . both are violations of the law in the @entity18 . it was the first time she was made aware that she faced charges , @entity0 said . she was allowed out on bail and has been staying since at the @entity1 @entity112 in @entity3 . subsequently , she said her manager advised her to tell the police it was voluntary sexual intercourse and likely the whole issue would just go away . she followed the advice and in one of the many hearings at the public prosecutor 's office , she made a statement saying it was voluntary . @entity0 was then charged with making a false statement . " that was my biggest regret because it was n't voluntary . i just thought it would all go away , " she told @entity21 . but a representative of @entity126 , who @entity0 worked for , told @entity21 that she was not advised by her manager to say the sex was consensual but rather by a police officer , who told her that in @entity97 and it was translated into @entity131 by her manager . @entity0 said a month after the rape , while forced to stay in @entity3 as the case wound through the legal system , she was fired . the representative , who declined to be publicly identified , said @entity0 and the @entity137 man she accused -- who is married with three children -- have both been terminated by @entity126 for " drinking alcohol at a staff conference that resulted in trouble with the police . " a statement released late saturday by @entity126 spokesman @entity144 said the company was sympathetic to @entity0 " during this very difficult situation . " it also said that company representatives were by her side through the initial investigation , spending " days at both the police station and the prosecutor 's office to help win her release . " " only when ms. @entity0 declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status , and ceased communication with her employer , was the company forced to end our relationship with her , " the statement said . " the decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation , and unfortunately neither ms. @entity0 nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status . " opinion : gang rapes , the dark side of @entity172 's protests the company is owned by @entity20 billionaire @entity174 , who made headlines earlier this year after it was revealed that he has secretly married singer @entity176 in 2012 . @entity0 was convicted tuesday on all three charges and was sentenced to one year in jail for having unlawful sex , three months in jail for making a false statement and one month for illegal consumption of alcohol . @entity21 could not immediately confirm what happened to the alleged perpetrator , who was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage . @entity0 is scheduled to appear at the court on september 5 to begin the appeal proceedings . @entity0 , who is not allowed to leave the @entity18 pending the appeal , said her lawyers have instructed her to be prepared to go back into jail while they submit a request for bail while the appeal is ongoing . as a rule , @entity21 does not identify victims of sexual assault , but @entity0 went public with her story . a facebook page has been set up calling for @entity0 's release , as well as a petition urging the @entity1 government to take action on her behalf . her conviction may risk wider diplomatic repercussions . @entity1 foreign affairs minister @entity211 called his @entity18 counterpart , @entity212 , on friday night to protest @entity0 's sentencing , a statement from the @entity1 ministry said . " i emphasized that we believe that the conviction is contrary to fundamental human rights , including conventions that the @entity18 have officially ratified , " @entity211 is quoted as saying . " @entity1 will continue to do what we can to support her in what is a very difficult situation . our cooperation with the @entity18 is strong and good , but i conveyed to my colleague that we are worried that this difficult case may disturb our good relations if we do not reach a good solution in the near future . " @entity0 told @entity21 she received a call from @entity211 on friday reiterating @entity1 's support . while @entity3 has a reputation as a cosmopolitan city that boasts @entity233 influences , where visitors can drink at bars and restaurants and unmarried couples can share hotel rooms , the country adheres to @entity240 laws and traditions . the @entity18 has been heavily criticized by rights groups , which say it condones sexual violence against women . @entity245 has called its record " shameful , " saying it must change the way it handles such cases . in december 2012 , a @entity251 woman reported being raped by three men in @entity3 . she was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined . in january 2010 , a @entity251 woman told authorities she was raped by an employee at a @entity3 hotel . she was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage . an @entity263 woman reported in 2008 that she was drugged and gang - raped . she was convicted of having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol , and she was sentenced to 11 months in prison . keeping chivalry alive in @entity69 : men respond to rape crisis	@entity20:Qatari	@entity21:CNN	@entity251:British	@entity112:Seaman 's Center	@entity137:Sudanese	@entity131:English	@entity3:Dubai	@entity233:Western	@entity1:Norway	@entity172:Egypt	@entity174:Wissam Al Mana	@entity212:Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan	@entity176:Janet Jackson	@entity18:UAE	@entity245:Human Rights Watch	@entity0:Marte Deborah Dalelv	@entity240:Islamic	@entity126:Al Mana Interiors	@entity263:Australian	@entity211:Eide	@entity144:Hani El Korek	@entity68:Swiss	@entity69:India	@entity97:Arabic

@entity129 co-founder @placeholder is helping with a @entity160 campaign	@entity135	( @entity0 ) -- his song is one of the enduring anthems of the turbulent 1960s , a soulful call to action awash in a psychedelic wave of sound . it has appeared in more than 100 movies and tv shows , even a multimillion - seller video game , and has been covered by artists from @entity13 to @entity14 to the @entity15 . so , decades later , what does @entity16 have to show for " @entity18 " ? so little that , early this year , the 72 - year - old found himself posting a photo online . in it , he held a poster declaring that he was living on @entity23 and charity , having gone nearly 30 years before seeing his first , paltry royalty check . the poster was taped to one of his gold records . " it 's been a long journey , " said @entity29 , who said he never blew his money on drugs or booze like so many artists before and after .

" " @entity18 " was a pop hit for the @entity52 , spending five weeks on the @entity54 chart in 1968 and peaking at no. 11 . the group , which shared the stage with the likes of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , would fail to match its success again . but it became emblematic of the political and social upheaval of the late ' 60s and would be used for decades to invoke the spirit of that era . as recently as last year , it was used in a pivotal scene in " homefront , " a military - style video game that has sold somewhere around 3 million copies . @entity29 said the entire group got about $ 4,000 for its use in that game . " if they did that with one of the major groups , mainly one from @entity78 and you know who they are , they would have gotten $ 150 - 200,000 for that , " he said . " we never got taken care of at all . " it 's a story of bad contracts -- and record company executives refusing to even honor those , he said . the contract for " @entity18 " promised a small percentage of sales , but the record company kept finding expenses that came out of the band 's share before they saw any of it . other albums were produced but never released , he said , although the " expenses " for them kept racking up . to this day , he 's not sure how some of those albums are available for sale online or who 's getting the money for them . that all led @entity29 , with the help of his son , @entity106 , to post the web photo as part of the " @entity111 " movement . " people were all riled up about the ' 1 % ' screwing over the little man , " said @entity112 , who has lived with his parents and helped support them through the lean years . " @entity116 wrote that piece of paper and i taped it to his gold record . " we woke up the next morning and it had 200 shares and 10,000 ' likes ' on @entity123 . @entity116 had 500 new friend requests . " @entity29 did n't identify himself in the photo . but it had picked up steam on social - news site @entity129 and it did n't take long for members of the site 's popular music community to figure it out . that 's where @entity135 , the co-founder of @entity129 , came in . he was fresh off of helping lead the @entity139 's successful fight against the @entity140 , legislation supporters said would crack down on internet piracy but that many in the web community felt would stifle free speech and creativity . " one of the few narratives the entertainment industry kept trying to push was that they were really pushing for this on behalf of the artists , " @entity135 said . @entity29 ' story , he said , showed how that business really treats its own sometimes . furthermore , he said , it was personal . " i was raised right by my dad -- the @entity155 , @entity106 , @entity59 , @entity58 ... . i had no idea , and my dad had no idea of the fate of @entity16 , " said @entity135 , 29 . view the @entity160 project : " @entity161 's @entity18 " he was n't the first person to reach out to @entity161 and his family . but they say many of the offers they 'd gotten sounded just as dodgy as ones from the days @entity161 said his band would play concerts for 1/10th of what other acts were getting . " sure , you 'd get five or six snakes out of the grass saying ... i want to book you a gig or something , " said @entity112 . " but i was familiar with @entity129 and checked out who @entity135 was . he said , ' i want to do this project with you guys , and i want this to blow up . ' " @entity135 helped @entity29 host an @entity129 ( " @entity129 " ) on @entity129 and create a project on crowd - funding site @entity160 to pay for his first new album in decades . with 16 days to go , " @entity161 's @entity18 " had raised $ 37,000 of its $ 39,000 goal on monday . if successful , that cash will pay for rehearsal , production and musicians . this time , @entity29 will retain the rights to the songs he records . " it 's very , very different -- much cleaner , " said @entity29 , who has continued to perform live through the years . " you do n't have to sit and hear somebody ( with a record company ) tell you their little stories . " there are so many of us who never got anything out of being a musician . i 'm just so blessed to have this opportunity to come back into the music world and put my feelings and lyrics and music out . " he 's already gone into the studio to record a pair of @entity215 songs , which were sent digitally to @entity160 backers .

" the man who sang that his " soul 's been psychedelicized " puts it differently . " you can get on the internet with all your creative processes and thought processes and it will take you to higher places than you could ever dream , " @entity29 said .

@placeholder says her show , " @entity20 , " gives an authentic picture of a @entity46 family	@entity7	( @entity0 ) introducing the @entity2 @entity1 , @entity3 when she was growing up in @entity6 , that 's what @entity7 wanted to be . at the time , as the daughter of @entity12 migrants , that dream must have seemed unattainable . now , not so much . for the last several months , the @entity14 graduate has been winning praise for her acting chops . and sunday , she became only the second @entity2 to ever win a @entity17 for best actress , for her role in the television show " @entity20 , " which airs on the @entity22 network . the first was @entity24 , who in 2007 took home a @entity17 for her role in the television show " @entity28 . " among the performers in the audience cheering on @entity7 's win sunday night : @entity1 . what turns this from a good story into a great one is that @entity7 -- recently dubbed the entertainment industry 's " @entity36 " by @entity38 -- is more than just a talented actress . we 've seen those before . true , given @entity43 's antiquated predilection toward telling stories in black and white -- to the exclusion of @entity46 , @entity47 and others who do n't fit into that narrow color scheme -- not enough of the talented @entity2 actresses who came before got the recognition they deserved or roles that reflected reality . but they were there , on screen and on film . many latinos have had @entity7 on their radar for the last several months . it 's all because of a series of thoughtful and provocative interviews that she has given about her priorities , world view and career choices . read the interviews and you 'll see : what makes @entity7 special is not that she can play a character , but that she has character . they do n't teach that sort of thing in acting school . you get it from your parents . and , in this case , @entity7 obviously got it from hers -- @entity82 and @entity83 . in july , on a panel during the @entity86 summer press tour in @entity87 , @entity7 discussed why she had turned down a role in @entity90 's " @entity89 " where latinas are cast as -- oh , the suspense -- housekeepers . she explained : " i found it limiting for the stories that @entity59 have . for the stories that @entity97 have , i feel like there 's a perception that people have about @entity59 in @entity97 specifically -- somebody growing up in @entity6 , @entity102 being my first language , @entity104 being my second -- that we are perceived a very certain way . our stories have been told , and they 're not unmoralistic -- you know , being a maid is fantastic . you know , i have many family members that have fed many of their families on doing that job , but there are other stories that need to be told . and i think that the media is a venue and an avenue to educate and teach our next generation . " she turned down a steady paycheck , with no guarantee that something else would come along . " i did n't become an artist to be a millionaire , " she told the gathering . " i did n't become an actor to wear @entity129 . i have to give this dress back when we 're done . i became an actor to change the way i grew up . the way i grew up , i never saw myself on screen . i have two older sisters . one 's an investment banker . the other one is a doctor , and i never saw us being played as investment bankers . and i realized how limiting that was for me . i would look at the screen and think , ' well , there 's no way i can do it , because i 'm not there . ' and it 's like as soon as you follow your dreams , you give other people the allowance to follow theirs . " when " @entity20 " came along , @entity7 thought the show -- which is loosely adapted from a @entity153 telenovela -- was the " most authentic , genuine representation " of a @entity46 family that she had ever seen on television , she told @entity158 . it has the alluring spice of cultural references , but not to the point where it overpowers the palate . " for once , i was reading a script where they were n't talking about my ethnicity , " she told the @entity158 . " they were n't putting a @entity12 flag on my shoulder . they were n't putting a taco in my hand . " in an industry full of people who are known for being shallow , self - centered and afraid to make waves , @entity7 is none of those things . she is smart , brave and eager to challenge those in power to confront their prejudices and blind spots . oddly enough , these are the kinds of things that are supposed to get you in trouble in @entity43 , where people think of themselves as liberal and do n't much appreciate those who tell them otherwise . remember the @entity193 hack story , and how flustered the liberal studio executives , writers , producers and actors became when it was revealed that some of what they say in private is n't very progressive ? but @entity7 is n't in trouble . instead , she 's on the fast track to stardom . and , best of all , she seems intent on taking her community along for the ride .	@entity22:CW	@entity20:Jane the Virgin	@entity24:America Ferrera	@entity28:Ugly Betty	@entity82:Genaro	@entity83:Magali	@entity86:Television Critics Association	@entity87:Beverly Hills	@entity153:Venezuelan	@entity89:Devious Maids	@entity3:Act I.	@entity2:Latina	@entity1:Meryl Streep	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Gina Rodriguez	@entity6:Chicago	@entity193:Sony	@entity47:Asians	@entity59:Latinos	@entity17:Golden Globe	@entity14:NYU	@entity12:Puerto Rican	@entity36:Next Big Thing	@entity38:The Hollywood Reporter	@entity102:English	@entity104:Spanish	@entity129:Louis Vuitton	@entity97:America	@entity90:Lifetime	@entity211:Ruben Navarrette	@entity46:Latino	@entity158:Times	@entity43:Hollywood

" @entity19 is out of politics , for me . i do n't understand when someone boycotts a competition . " two @entity24 senators recently wrote a letter to football 's global governing body @entity26 calling for @entity2 to be expelled from the @entity28 while also being stripped of its right to host the 2018 event . two @entity2 politicians responded by sending a letter of their own to @entity26 demanding the @entity24 be kicked out of @entity13 2014 for previous aggressive actions against @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and recent action in @entity38 . political controversy -- @entity2 's anti-gay propaganda law and a $ 50 billion budget -- also dominated the build - up to the recent @entity43 . @entity2 topped the medal table with 13 gold medals ; success which @entity6 says has ramped up the pressure on his players ahead of the @entity12 -- which begins on june 12 . " we are euphoric because a lot of medals go to @entity2 , " said @entity6 . " we are really proud of the results .

she says his girlfriend @placeholder reportedly has reconciled with @entity16	@entity15	editor 's note : @entity2 is host of the @entity4 show , " issues with @entity2 , " a topical event - driven show with a wide range of viewpoints . @entity2 is the author of " secrets can be murder : what @entity12 's @entity11 . " @entity2 says the @entity16 - @entity15 relationship sends a bad message to young people . @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- pop star @entity16 has been charged with two felonies -- including assault -- in the @entity15 beating case . if convicted , @entity16 could face more than four years behind bars . the charges stem from the early morning of february 8 , when he and his girlfriend @entity15 reportedly got into a heated argument in his car hours before they were scheduled to appear at the @entity29 's . what police say happened next shook the entertainment world . a @entity34 affidavit says @entity16 gave @entity15 a vicious and continuous beating . he allegedly started by shoving @entity15 's head against the passenger window , then punched her in the face numerous times while still driving . the beating reportedly splattered blood on @entity15 's clothing and the car interior . the report goes on to say that in between barrages of punches , @entity16 placed @entity15 in a headlock and bit her ear -- still driving , mind you . after stopping the car , @entity15 says @entity16 again put her in a headlock . she said she began losing consciousness and as she fought back , he bit her finger . days later , a gruesome police photo of @entity15 leaked to the media and it showed her with a bruised , scratched face and a split lip . it was clear evidence of a continuous pummeling , not some impassioned slap in the heat of the moment . perhaps even more shocking than these grisly details are reports that this may not have been @entity16 's first time abusing @entity15 . according to @entity68 , @entity15 told the @entity69 that @entity16 had attacked her several times in the past , and the assaults were gradually becoming more violent . yet less than a month after this ordeal , @entity15 has apparently forgiven him . amazingly , according to an unidentified source quoted by @entity74 , @entity16 called @entity15 on her 21st birthday and the two then reunited for some time together at @entity76 , @entity77 , mansion . through her lawyer , @entity15 asked a judge thursday not to prohibit @entity16 from having contact with her while he faces the felony charges of assaulting her . before the reported reconciliation , @entity16 attended anger management classes , according to the @entity85 , even though legally he did n't have to . sure , it 's a positive step , but come on , @entity15 ! nobody can change that quickly . @entity15 and @entity16 's punch drunk love is sending a dangerous message to their young fans . and do n't tell me children are n't paying attention , because they are both up for @entity95 on march 28 . @entity15 's apparent quick forgiveness for the alleged pummeling sends the worst possible signal -- namely , that this sort of behavior is just par for the course when it comes to male - female relationships . when you look at the numbers , it is certainly more prevalent than we 'd like to admit . according to a study by the @entity110 , 5.3 million women are abused annually in the @entity12 . an @entity112 survey found that about one out of four @entity12 women are raped or physically assaulted by a current or former partner at some point in their lifetime . but there is some progress . the @entity122 's @entity121 found that intimate partner abuse rates in @entity12 have steadily declined since 1993 . yet the @entity15 beating shows just how much ground we still must cover . as much as i sympathize with her , i think @entity15 herself may have to go to classes . her reported reunion with @entity16 enables his allegedly abusive behavior and is , in my opinion , a classic case of battered woman 's syndrome . if she is going back to @entity16 so soon , @entity15 is putting herself at risk and seems to be falling into the brutal cycle of powerlessness , fear and low self esteem that often accompanies abusive relationships . and it sends a message to @entity16 that he does n't have to change . ireport.com : @entity16 fans : share your reaction if the reconciliation is real , @entity15 is also setting a dangerous example for other abused women . unfortunately , despite her incredible looks and talent , i think she is now the poster child for battered woman 's syndrome . our society must stop this cycle of helplessness that traps abused women . we must give them the help they need to escape the abusive spiral . but women must begin holding their loved ones to a zero - tolerance policy when it comes to violence . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .	@entity20:CNN	@entity29:Grammy	@entity85:New York Daily News	@entity110:Centers for Disease Control	@entity12:America	@entity2:Velez-Mitchell	@entity173:Singer	@entity4:HLN	@entity74:People magazine	@entity77:Florida	@entity76:Sean " Diddy " Combs ' Miami	@entity16:Brown	@entity15:Rihanna	@entity34:Los Angeles County	@entity11:Most Sensational Crimes Tell Us About Ourselves	@entity19:NEW YORK	@entity95:Kid 's Choice Awards	@entity122:Department of Justice	@entity121:Bureau of Justice Statistics	@entity68:TMZ	@entity69:LAPD	@entity112:American Bar Association
african - americans in @entity1 excited about @placeholder 's chances	@entity5	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 is 84 years old and a doubter no more . @entity3 , 84 , says he knows @entity5 is going to win , because he believes " @entity6 answers prayers .

" from where i came from , with the segregation and all the hatred , i never thought an @entity15 would get this far in the @entity17 . really . " but three weeks until @entity18 , @entity3 and many other african - americans are now optimistic they will be part of history . " i am kind of anticipating it will happen , " said @entity23 , a soft - spoken @entity15 man in his 60s . " but no , i did not expect it to happen in my lifetime . " it is the flip side of the " race debate " in @entity30 : while the @entity5 campaign and its @entity12 allies are aggressively working to address the concerns of blue - collar and rural whites who are reluctant to support a black candidate for president , there is an enthusiasm in the @entity15 - @entity15 community that @entity12 believe could lead to dramatically increased turnout and perhaps tip the scales in several key battlegrounds , @entity1 among them . african - americans cast 10 percent of the ballots for president in 2000 and about 12 percent in 2004 . @entity5 aides believe if that percentage increased just modestly in 2008 , it could make the difference in at least a half - dozen states : @entity1 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 . @entity57 and @entity58 are additional battlegrounds where @entity5 organizers are counting on an increase in @entity15 - @entity15 turnout in their @entity18 game plan . to reach its goal , the campaign is counting on a combination of newly registered african - americans and aggressive outreach to tens of thousands black voters who are registered to vote but have stayed home in past elections . see why @entity15 - @entity17 are finding hope in @entity5 ¬ª at @entity9 , the rev. @entity72 is careful not to preach from the pulpit : he exhorts his congregants to vote but does not preach in favor of or against any specific candidate . still , a visit to his services found an overwhelmingly pro-obama crowd , and @entity72 says the enthusiasm level about this election is unprecedented in his two decades as the inner - city church 's pastor . " the energy comes from the fact that it is historical , and we 've got a lot of first - time voters and many like myself who have been through a few , and it still has that pumped up energy in it , " @entity72 said . increased @entity15 - @entity15 turnout is all the more important because of @entity5 's tougher challenge in more conservative , rural areas . in the @entity99 , a roadside billboard shows a cartoon of @entity5 with a turban , his middle name " @entity104 " in bold red letters . " hmmmm , " @entity72 said when shown a photograph of the billboard , keeping his trademark calm . " if i spent my time getting angry about the things people do , then i ca n't do what i effectively do here , " @entity72 said as he gestured toward the pulpit . " those people who do stuff like that , the only thing i can say is , we pray for them . " @entity117 says that for months , he doubted that @entity5 could win , but now he believes he can . still , @entity117 took time after services to compliment @entity120 nominee @entity119 for trying to calm angry supporters at recent rallies , including a woman last week who incorrectly said she was worried about an @entity5 presidency because he is @entity125 . " it has gotten a little nasty , " @entity117 said .

@entity18 calls the @placeholder region a " treasure trove " of rare creatures	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- a rat believed to be extinct for 11 million years , a spider with a foot - long legspan , and a hot pink cyanide - producing " dragon millipede " are among the thousand newly discovered species in the largely unexplored @entity6 region . the " dragon millipede " is among the 1,068 new species discovered in the @entity6 region . the region , including parts of @entity13 and five other countries , is home to 1,068 species found between 1997 and 2007 , according to a @entity18 report released this week . some of the creatures were not lurking in fertile floodplains or tropical foliage . a scientist visiting an outdoor restaurant was startled to see a @entity25 rock rat among the nearby wildlife . the hairy , nocturnal , thick - tailed rat , which resembles a squirrel , had been thought for centuries to be extinct . " there is a certain amount of shock because our scientists will sometimes see something that does n't fit anything they know , " said @entity30 , director of the @entity18 's @entity31 . " they run through a catalogue of wildlife in their brain , asking themselves , ' have i seen this ? ' " perhaps a more startling discovery than the rat was a bright green pit viper scientists spotted slithering through the rafters of a restaurant in @entity51 in @entity52 . the fund dubbed the @entity6 a " biological treasure trove . " the organization 's report " @entity57 in the @entity6 " says 519 plants , 279 fish , 88 frogs , 88 spiders , 46 lizards , 22 snakes , 15 mammals , four birds , four turtles , two salamanders and a toad were found . scientists are still trying to determine if they have uncovered thousands of new invertebrate species . scientists are discovering new species at a rate of two per week , said @entity30 , who said the reason for publishing the report now was twofold . " we realized that we should highlight these discoveries in part because of the legacy of war and conflict in the region , " she said . " there 's an urgency with the threat of development in the @entity6 countries . " a horned bovine found in 1991 living in the evergreen forests of the @entity88 of @entity25 and @entity13 has not been found in recent years , she said . timber development and mining industries are encroaching . there are 150 large hydropower dams that have been constructed along the @entity6 river , and another 150 are slated to be built , according to the @entity18 . dams that can trap and kill fish are at different stages of planning in the @entity6 . high variation in geography and climate zones that enabled species to flourish are now jeopardized by climate change , said @entity30 . @entity104 is always a threat in countries touched by the @entity106 , particularly @entity107 . also known as @entity107 , the largest country by geographical area in mainland @entity109 has been ravaged over the years by conflict , political instability and natural disaster . this summer , for example , the @entity113 reported that as many as 100,000 people were killed by a cyclone that hit @entity107 . the country 's ruling military junta blocked the outside world for weeks before allowing aid to flow into the region . there are cultural obstacles to protecting rare species , too . many restaurants serve them as food . restaurants often have rickety bamboo floors that one can look through to see cages filled with exotic animals , @entity30 says . the more exotic the animal , the more status it often bestows on the person who consumes it . " reports [ like the @entity18 's ] are important because these regions can be educated , " said @entity137 , the director of @entity138 , which is funded by the @entity139 and supports local @entity141 organizations working toward an open society .

violence at @placeholder 's marikana platinum mine left 44 people dead last month	@entity38	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- operators of a @entity5 gold mine negotiated with about 15,000 striking workers monday after they walked off the job the night before , a company official said . " at this stage , the reason for the strike remains unclear , but we hope to gain clarity as soon as possible , " said a statement from @entity9 , a @entity10 executive vice president . " the situation in the mine has been calm and peaceful since the start of the strike , and we appeal to all stakeholders to continue to act with restraint and to engage in good faith . " it is important that we restore normality in a peaceful manner and as soon as possible , " he said . management called the strike at the @entity29 on the @entity30 " @entity31 and unprotected . " the striking miners could not immediately be reached for comment . the @entity29 workers join about 28,000 other miners who are already on strike at the @entity38 platinum mine in @entity39 , about two hours northwest of @entity0 . august 16 clashes at the @entity38 mine left 34 people dead and 78 wounded , sparking national outrage . management at @entity38 set a monday deadline for strikers to return to work , but workers did not appear to heed the call , as several thousand were marching outside the facility . the violence in august erupted after negotiations between striking workers and @entity38 broke down and police decided to fence in the machete - armed miners with barbed wire , police said . thousands of mineworkers had been striking for days for higher wages . @entity38 has so far missed out on around $ 75 million in lost production , and the workers have n't been paid for a month . the company said last week that a " peace accord " had been signed , but key unions had not agreed to the deal . late last month , a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues , who are believed to have been shot by police . however , a national prosecutor has said that authorities would dismiss the provisional charges and release the miners , pending further investigation . @entity5 drops murder charges against miners last week , 47 of the miners appeared in court and were ordered released . lawyers for the miners had called the decision to charge them with murder " bizarre in the extreme . " the country 's justice minister called the charges shocking and confusing . clashes also erupted last week between protesters and security officers outside @entity95 's @entity94 gold mine in @entity96 , about 24 miles ( 39 kilometers ) east of @entity0 , police said . the violence occurred after former employees staged a protest outside the mine 's gates , @entity0 police capt. @entity97 said . the protesters had been fired for participating in an earlier illegal strike , the company said . @entity1 's @entity106 contributed to this report .	@entity31:Unlawful	@entity30:West Rand	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Johannesburg	@entity5:South Africa	@entity10:Gold Field	@entity39:Marikana	@entity38:Lonmin	@entity9:Peter Turner	@entity29:KDC	@entity106:Aja Harris	@entity97:Pinky Tsinyane	@entity96:Springs	@entity95:Gold One	@entity94:Modder East

" she saw this redhead kid and said , ' let 's give him a break . he seems like he can do some acting , ' " @entity17 said . @entity2 made his @entity26 debut in 1936 in " @entity57 of 1936 " before legendary director - playwright @entity58 hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in @entity62 and @entity64 's " @entity63 " in 1939 . the next year , @entity58 cast him as a chorus boy and @entity67 's understudy in @entity62 and @entity64 's groundbreaking musical " @entity69 , " according to @entity33 . his film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of " @entity63 .

@entity1 radio station @placeholder says on during , after earthquake	@entity8	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- in the aftermath of @entity1 's devastating earthquake , a small radio station became an informational lifeline for people in @entity0 and beyond . the radio station , @entity8 , managed to stay on the air during the earthquake , leaving music playing while its employees fled the building . the station 's studios and broadcasting tower withstood the 7.0 - magnitude quake , and with electricity provided by multiple generators , it became one of the few places stunned @entity1 could turn for information and directions in the following days . " we say that the only way communicate with the people and the world to is to stay on , " station manager @entity24 told @entity2 . " and we stayed on . " @entity8 has stayed on the air throughout the nearly two weeks since the quake , though occasionally broadcasting at reduced power . at first , it had only three days of fuel to keep its generators going , but the @entity1 government and private organizations contributed more . interactive map of where to find aid , hospitals in @entity1 @entity24 said he went on the air shortly after the earthquake , telling listeners " that we have been hit by an earthquake , and , you know ... say the radio station is there . we gon na talk to you . " the station quickly organized a panel discussion with reporters , talking about what happened and getting dire reports from the surrounding city . " people would come , and say i have this problem ... people are dead this way , why do n't you send somebody that way . that was the first day , " @entity24 said . " the second day , they were saying we need water there , we need doctor there , we need food there . that 's how it started . " the station 's broadcast signal reaches about 3 million people around @entity0 . and it has international reach via the @entity77 , allowing people to get messages to relatives all over the world . " somebody would call and say if you 're alive , come in front of @entity8 [ and ] i 'll meet you at this time , " @entity24 said . others have used it to inform search - and - rescue workers about sites where people may still be buried alive , as well as food and water distribution sites . people now bring letters and notes to the station to be read on air . one woman went on the air , out of desperation , to ask for help in finding her husband . when it worked , @entity24 got the bear - hug of a lifetime from the man . " you should have seen him . he was almost choking me , " @entity24 said . radio is a powerful tool in a country with a literacy rate of about 62 percent , according to @entity113 . and with tens of thousands of people now living in tents or makeshift shelters , aid agencies have been distributing portable radios to keep them in touch . @entity120 : looking for loved ones in @entity1 the @entity122 has been handing out solar - powered and hand - cranked radios to an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 @entity1 now housed at a former golf course in the @entity0 suburb of @entity126 . the military will be broadcasting on three different radio stations . " we 'll pull people out of the audience and we 'll ask , what 's one thing you want to know and what 's going on out there , that we do n't know , " said 1st lt. @entity129 of the @entity122 's @entity130 . the tents and tarps sprawling across the @entity126 green has been sectioned off into communities , with an area to buy food and clothing , and even to get a haircut . some vendors use car batteries to charge cell phones for 50 cents a pop. one of the tens of thousands now housed here is 22 - year - old @entity152 , whose mother , father , brothers and sisters died in the quake . taking shelter under a tree from the stifling heat , he told @entity2 that @entity8 is " the most important source of information now .

although representative of a new generation of artists , @placeholder says she feels alien to our information era .	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- few female @entity2 artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor @entity5 enjoys . her work has been exhibited in @entity8 and throughout @entity9 . she was the subject of a recent joint survey show at the @entity11 . she was one of four winners of this year 's @entity15 competition and was also recently featured in @entity17 vogue . @entity5 first garnered attention for her sculptures of women . working in porcelain , bronze and fiberglass , her figures are often nude , slouching , and wearing vacant or depressed expressions . " your body , " a 2.6 - meter - high fiberglass sculpture made in 2005 was collected by the @entity27 . a seated , slouching and vacant - eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen , sagging breasts and fat rolls , critic @entity35 , a dean at the @entity36 , has described the work as an expression of " fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness . " the effect of @entity5 's work is often disquieting , even though her figures are recognizable . according to curator and critic @entity55 , @entity5 's " sense of social satire is anchored in the commonplace , in the daily exigencies and social exchanges of an ordinary woman 's life , in the small vanities , frauds and violations . " @entity5 says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry . " from the day we are born , we have many , many questions -- all kinds of questions from what we see , what we experience and what we know . " i think art is possibly one of the ways , one of the channels , to help us to find out certain truths , " she says . her sculptures of women , for instance , are an attempt " to deal with everything that had to do with female existence . " but , she says , " after a while , if you work on a deeper level , you will discover that whether male or female , you 're ultimately dealing with human nature . in other words , the deeper you go , you move further away from gender but you get closer to human nature . " more than gender politics , she is interested in human relationships . " individuals are in fact very alien , very distant to each other . however , as we 're collective animals , social animals , we all end up in a kind of a relationship ... i think we 're like two neighboring islands , gradually getting close to each other . " more from @entity100 : from builder to @entity103 - winning architect raised in @entity104 by an editor and film studio director , @entity5 studied at @entity104 's @entity107 , graduating in 1995 . one of the first artists to make an impression on her was @entity111 , a sculptor from @entity112 whose work @entity5 first saw when she was at high school . it was the first time she had seen sculpture that was n't a politically - freighted monument or memorial , she says . " he had created an emotional state of human beings . " but @entity5 's process is too personal to be inspired by anyone or anything else . in fact , she rejects the notion of inspiration altogether . " i do n't think art is like design , when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there . " " art is more the expression of your points of view , or whatever you want to express in the long process of your understanding -- often it has a very long thread throughout . " every three years , @entity5 puts on a solo show containing series of works that represent a particular line of questioning , she says . typically , she draws a rough sketch with measurements marked in , which her assistants use as the basis for creating a steel framework . @entity5 then uses clay to shape a form , from which a plaster mold is created , which she then paints . the production phase is physically exhausting for @entity5 . " every time when i work on something , i would eat very little and sleep very little and become very , very thin . " but , she says , " the most challenging part of the whole creation is the initial thinking process , " something she describes as " painful , " even " torturing . " " the actual work ... i can complete it within a year or a year and a half . but before that , i have to think for a long , long time ... trying hard to convince myself . " she says she does n't use photographs or work from models : " it all comes from my head . " although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike , @entity5 says she is n't aiming for realism . " if you put a real person 's face next to it , you will see a lot of differences . but what matters to me is ... the poignance of the expression . " " i want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker , to awaken his body , so that his body can experience the sculpture . that 's why i really want people to stand right in front of my sculpture , to face ( it ) . " more from @entity100 : top designer shares secret of staying in vogue @entity5 knows she is living in an interesting period of @entity2 history . " i was born in 1968 . we 've gone through the @entity203 , then the @entity205 period , then the recent years of rapid economic growth . " these have been the decades when @entity2 has gone through the most dramatic , the fastest changes ever . and contemporary @entity2 art has been born and developed within these last 30 years . " what that means for @entity5 personally is not yet clear , though . being thrown into the cross currents of history is , she says , " good fortune " on one hand , but she also says , " i 'm not very adaptable . " in fact , an artist heralded by critics and collectors as exemplary of exciting new developments in a still - developing world , says she often feels out of step . " i feel that i 'm gradually becoming more and more alien to this era , as i feel that the world has become more and more extrovert , more and more superficial . " it 's become ever so easy to know , to see and to experience too many things . the ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse . there are more and more channels ... and more and more platforms . " people have become ... more and more extroverted . however , i think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us . and this world is n't small at all . in fact , it can be enormous .

16 - year - old @placeholder is reunited with her father after rescue in @entity31	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity4 , the @entity5 teenager whose abduction triggered a manhunt across the @entity8 , has survived " a tremendous , horrific ordeal " and faces a slow healing process , her father said monday . " i am very proud of her and i love her very much , " @entity11 said . " she is surrounded by the love of her family , friends and community . " but authorities kept the detail of that horrific ordeal close to the vest monday , two days after the man accused of abducting @entity4 and killing her mother and brother was killed by an @entity27 agent . the 16 - year - old was found alive after a frantic , week - long search that stretched from southern @entity5 to the wilderness of central @entity31 , more than 1,000 miles away , where she was found at a campsite by a mountain lake . at a news conference in @entity0 , @entity11 thanked investigators as well as reporters and social media users who spread the story " across and beyond " the @entity41 . how to help @entity4 " have no doubt that this did make a difference , " he said . but he said it was time " for us to grieve and move on to the healing process , " and he pleaded for the " respect and time " needed for that to happen . @entity4 's ordeal came to an end after a tip from horseback riders sent @entity27 agents swarming to a camping spot outside @entity55 , @entity31 . @entity4 , the man investigators had sought in her disappearance , was shot in a confrontation with an @entity27 tactical agent . @entity4 told authorities that @entity4 fired at least once before being shot , @entity61 @entity60 said . " obviously we would have liked for mr. @entity4 to surrender and face justice in the court of law , " @entity60 said . " but that 's not going to be the case . " @entity4 did not appear to have significant physical injuries and was reunited with her father sunday . she was unaware that her mother and brother were dead until after @entity4 was killed , when she was told of their killings by @entity27 interviewers , @entity60 said . @entity60 would discuss no details of @entity4 's abduction except to say she was under " extreme duress " the entire time . he said the investigation is still going on , but cautioned , " we might never know some of these answers . " " when you get a completely irrational act like we 've seen here , with two murders and a kidnapping , sometimes you 're not going to come up with a rational explanation of what happened , " he said . grief to euphoria : @entity90 rescued , suspect killed ' @entity92 ' and his interest in @entity4 @entity4 's friendship with the @entity11 family had been long and close , predating @entity4 's birth . @entity4 referred to him as " @entity92 . " but there were some signs that @entity4 was infatuated with @entity4 and signs he was trying to lure the family to his home in rural @entity103 , near the @entity105 border , her grandparents said . the signs were subtle , according to grandparents @entity106 and @entity107 , also of @entity0 . " he seemed to enjoy being with @entity4 and her friends ... more and more , " @entity108 said , shaking his head . " but he 's been with the kids for years .

" i do n't think she would have gone willingly with him at all , " she said . in an earlier episode , @entity129 recalled a trip that @entity4 and @entity4 took to @entity141 . the trip was supposed to be for one week , but @entity4 told @entity129 that they came back after two days because @entity4 was upset that she was n't paying enough attention to him . ' you ca n't really tell the book by its cover ' @entity107 said @entity4 would have done anything for them and they would have returned the favor . " my message is to parents : just be more aware , more conscious of what 's going on , " @entity107 said . " life gets busy , but take the time . if anything , learn something from this and that is just to be more aware for your children . " @entity108 added : " i guess you ca n't really tell the book by its cover , " he said . " it was just complete shock . we did n't have any idea . i do n't know what you would look for . " in the weeks before @entity4 's home in rural @entity103 went up in flames , he pleaded for the @entity175 to visit him one last time . he had lost the home to foreclosure and said he was moving back to @entity178 . " we feel it was planned at this point based on the information that 's out there , " said @entity107 . " it 's so unfortunate . apparently he tried to get her up there before , but she could n't go and so ... she went , took the dog and the kids . " @entity4 went missing after cheerleading practice on august 3 . the next day , the bodies of her mother , @entity191 , 42 , and 8 - year - old brother , @entity192 , were found about 45 miles east of @entity0 , in @entity4 's burned house in @entity194 . the body of a dog was also recovered , police said . the horror spurred an @entity199 and a manhunt , which zeroed in the @entity31 highlands after @entity4 's blue @entity202 was found outside @entity55 . then there was a sighting of the pair by horseback riders , who considered them poorly equipped for the environment . ' red flags ' @entity209 , one of those riders , said sunday that they saw multiple " red flags " during their brief encounter , including the brand - new camping equipment they carried and the pajama - like bottoms @entity4 was wearing . it was " just like a square peg going into a round hole , " @entity209 said . " they did n't fit . " another rider , @entity219 , said it looked like @entity4 " had a scared look on her face , " adding about @entity4 : " i just had a gut feeling about him . " unaware of the @entity199 , however , the horseback riders continued on , and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together . " when i seen that picture on the screen , i told my wife , i said , ' that is the girl that was up on that mountain , ' " @entity209 recalled . hundreds of law enforcement agents started to scour 300 square miles of rough terrain -- dense forests , steep valleys and peaks over 8,000 feet -- hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires . key moments in the manhunt late saturday afternoon , they spotted the pair 's campsite near @entity250 , about 30 miles from @entity55 . but the topography was so steep , helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp . hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene , local sheriffs ' departments said . they moved in carefully so they would n't alert @entity4 that they were coming . they moved in after @entity4 and the girl were separated , unshering @entity4 to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away . at some point , a " confrontation " ensued between authorities and @entity4 , @entity60 said . the confrontation ended when an @entity27 tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect . @entity1 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .	@entity194:Boulevard	@entity27:FBI	@entity129:Chavez	@entity192:Ethan	@entity250:Morehead Lake	@entity278:Alicia Eakin	@entity276:AnneClaire Stapleton	@entity277:Mariano Castillo	@entity274:Gregg Canes	@entity275:Miguel Marquez	@entity272:Greg Botelho	@entity273:Holly Yan	@entity141:Hollywood	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:San Diego	@entity175:Andersons	@entity199:Amber Alert	@entity4:Hannah	@entity178:Texas	@entity8:West	@entity219:Mike Young	@entity191:Christina Anderson	@entity55:Cascade	@entity31:Idaho	@entity11:Anderson	@entity209:John	@entity103:San Diego County	@entity105:Mexican	@entity106:Ralph	@entity107:Sara Britt	@entity108:Ralph Britt	@entity202:Nissan Versa	@entity122:Marissa Chavez	@entity92:Uncle Jim	@entity90:Teen	@entity5:California	@entity41:United States	@entity60:Gore	@entity61:San Diego County Sheriff
writer took exception to some of @placeholder 's comments	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- it might seem a bit strange that actress @entity3 chose an event watched by millions to make the case for the need for privacy . well , this is @entity9 , after all . the celebrated actress took the occasion of receiving the @entity12 at sunday 's @entity14 ceremony to make several personal statements -- including a few that were n't exactly clear . but one thing @entity3 was definitive about was how much she values her privacy . in a speech that many found to be touching and which appeared to address gossip about her sexual orientation , the 50 - year - old @entity3 reflected on being in show business since she was 3 years old . " if you had been a public figure from the time that you were a toddler , if you 'd had to fight for a life that felt real and honest and normal against all odds , then maybe you , too , might value privacy above all else , " she said , to cheers from the @entity14 crowd . 5 memorable moments from the @entity14 but how realistic is the expectation of privacy in an age where many celebrities depend on their social media connection to fans more than they do traditional marketing machines and every moment of their lives is reported in the media ? long gone are the days when a studio would work with journalists to bury negative press about stars or protect their personal lives , said @entity49 , founding director of the @entity50 for @entity51 and @entity52 at @entity53 . " everybody who is carrying around a cell phone has the ability to take a picture of you behaving badly , getting in trouble , " @entity49 said . " people have been hounding celebrities for as long as their have been celebrities , but now there are just so many more venues to where the results of that hounding can go . " and in some cases the celebrities are feeding into those venues . @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 accounts are almost mandatory for the 21st - century star who can choose to reveal themselves to millions of fans without having to hold a press conference or even leaving their homes . take @entity80 and @entity81 , whose reignited connection has been thoroughly documented by the pair via their social media accounts -- and just as thoroughly criticized by music fans and the news media . yet these same celebrities will sometimes insist that they hope the media will " respect their privacy . " while a writer for @entity95 , journalist @entity94 tackled the issue in a piece titled " @entity98 " in which he noted that " @entity100 " star @entity99 announced on @entity71 that he and his partner @entity101 were expecting twins while " hoping the press can respect our privacy . " " seriously ? why did you tweet this personal information if you wanted privacy ? " @entity94 wrote . " i think @entity99 is an extremely gifted and funny guy , but this is yet another in a long line of celebrities asking us to respect their privacy while at the same time broadcasting news about their family or career -- and i 'm only talking about the last week or so . " not that @entity3 has ever been the type to share even the most benign parts of her personal life , yet alone on social media . which may be why some viewers waited with bated breath when she announced at the @entity14 that she had " a sudden urge to say something that i 've never really been able to air in public . " " i am single , " @entity3 said after a bit of a buildup . the audience laughed . " seriously , i hope that you 're not disappointed that there wo n't be a big coming - out speech tonight because i already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the @entity132 , very quaint days when a fragile young girl would open up to trusted friends and family , co-workers and then gradually , proudly to everyone who knew her , to everyone she actually met , " she continued . " but now apparently , i 'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life with a press conference , a fragrance , and a prime - time reality show , " @entity3 said . " and you guys might be surprised , but i am not @entity149 . no. i 'm sorry . that 's just not me . " while many cheered @entity3 's remarks , some were less than enthused . @entity155 writer @entity154 wrote , " it seems a bit less than gracious , and something of a stretch , for @entity3 to conflate the public 's desire to know about her orientation with a fragrance - toting , prime - time - reality - show mugging celebrity culture . " " was @entity164 acting like @entity149 when she came out , " @entity154 said . " how about @entity165 , or @entity166 , or @entity167 ? @entity3 seems to be suggesting that it 's the absurd degree to which the media and the world no longer value privacy that has forced her to hold on to her own so tightly . but @entity3 is 50 years old , and @entity149 has n't been around for more than a year . " fellow former child actor @entity172 discussed the issue of privacy in a recent " wtf with @entity177 " podcast and said he traces the interest to the rise in the tabloid culture over the past few years that has people enthralled with the lives of celebrities . @entity185 and @entity186 : a right to privacy ? " all of a sudden ( celebs ) are being put out as the most important kings and queens of our community , " @entity172 said . in general , @entity172 said , the public " are becoming increasingly fascinated with pop culture and shiny things and squashed and stretched animated versions of our superheroes . we are becoming less and less concerned about privacy , security . " @entity53 professor @entity49 said that with the 24 - hour news cycle and so many publications trying to outdo each other in terms of exclusives , celebrity " images and barging in on their privacy is a cottage industry for a lot of people . " should celebrities feel entitled to privacy ? " maybe , " he said . " but should you expect that you are going to get it ? " " probably not .

" @entity14 called the explosions " completely unacceptable " as he mounted an impassioned defense of @entity2 society in the face of what seems to be its first suicide bombing . " this is not the path we want to go down . it is very serious that this has already happened , " he said . " @entity2 is an open society , " @entity14 added . " it is an open society which has demonstrated a will that people must be able to come from different backgrounds , believe in different gods or not believe in any god at all . be able to live @entity42 , together , in our open society . " posts on websites that frequently feature statements and propaganda videos from @entity50 radical groups posted a name and photo of a man identified as the attacker on sunday . but @entity2 police did not confirm the name sunday evening , saying they were still trying to notify relatives of the dead man . regional police chief @entity59 said the bomber had " failed . " " while this was a very serious event , no innocent people were seriously hurt . if that was the intention , then the perpetrator failed , " she said , adding that the country would not increase its terror threat level . @entity69 , head of the security measures division for @entity2 security police , told reporters sunday that based on the agency 's criteria for terrorism and a chief prosecutor 's assessment , " it is our judgment that this was an act of terrorism . " he said authorities are investigating whether the two explosions were related to one another , " but there may well be a connection . " on sunday night , @entity91 's @entity90 executed a search warrant in @entity93 , north of @entity91 , in connection with the @entity6 probe , a police spokesman said . the spokesman , who would not give his name , said the warrant was executed under @entity99 's @entity98 and that " no arrests have been made ... and no hazardous substances have been found . " the writer of the e-mailed threats to the @entity2 news agency and police mentions the presence of @entity2 troops in @entity108 and a @entity2 cartoonist who depicted the prophet @entity110 , according to @entity111 , a @entity2 news wire that received the threats . the e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in @entity2 and @entity117 , @entity111 reported . about 500 @entity2 troops are in @entity108 , according to @entity120 's @entity119 . the sender referred to @entity2 silence regarding the @entity108 troops and the controversial cartoon by @entity125 that depicted @entity110 as having the body of a dog .

" our actions will speak for themselves , " the person said in an audio recording attached to the e-mail . " as long as you do n't end your war against @entity50 and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to @entity125 the pig .

" @entity69 said authorities are working on both intelligence and a normal police investigation and will try to determine " if there may be any more acts of terrorism like this one being planned . at this point , we do n't think there are more acts coming , but we ca n't say for sure . " " what has happened does not signify a change of the current terrorism threat level in @entity2 , but we will continuously be reassessing this to see if what has happened warrants a change in threat level , " he said . in a message posted on @entity222 saturday , @entity2 foreign minister @entity220 said , " most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central @entity6 . failed -- but could have been truly catastrophic .

@entity4 's government accuses it of bias towards the persecuted @placeholder minority	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has been banned from operating in @entity4 's strife - torn @entity2 , following official accusations the aid organization is biased towards the state 's persecuted @entity8 minority . the international medical ngo , also known as @entity1 , was last week banned from the southeast @entity12 nation , where it provides essential healthcare to tens of thousands of patients and has operated for 22 years . on saturday , the organization announced that the government had allowed it to resume operations in a number of regions , but not in @entity2 , where the majority of the predominantly @entity25 country 's disenfranchised @entity23 minority is concentrated . since 2012 , the state , home to an estimated 800,000 stateless @entity8 , has seen outbreaks of communal violence that have killed hundreds and left 140,000 displaced . in a statement , @entity1 said it was " deeply shocked by this unilateral decision . as the major ngo healthcare provider in @entity2 , it ran clinics in nine townships across the state , " treating anyone who was unable to access the medical care they required , " including tens of thousands of vulnerable people who displaced into camps by recurrent communal violence . but @entity43 , spokesman for @entity4 president @entity44 , said the organization had been banned from the state for consistently showing favoritism towards the @entity8 -- a stateless group @entity4 's government does not recognize as a legitimate ethnic minority , but regards instead as interlopers from neighboring @entity51 . " @entity1 's foreign and local staff in @entity2 have created a lot of problems because they are not following their core principle of neutrality and impartiality , " he said . " when they give treatment to people they prefer to emphasize on the @entity64 people . sometimes rakhine people visit their clinic seeking help and they 're refused . they allow transportation of @entity64 patients to the nearby hospital but they fail to provide the same service to the @entity2 people . " the perceived bias had " created a lot of tension in the local community , " he said . nine days ago , hundreds protested against the @entity10 in @entity78 , the state capital . read more : @entity83 police raid illegal border camp holding @entity8 @entity1 would not reveal the reasons it had been ordered to halt operations , citing the sensitivity of the situation , but responded to the accusation of bias with a statement that " all @entity1 services are provided based on medical need only , regardless of ethnicity , religion or any other factor . " reports have speculated that the ban was triggered by @entity1 statements contradicting the official government 's account of a recent massacre alleged to have occurred in the @entity2 township of @entity103 in january . the @entity105 and human rights groups claim at least 40 @entity106 were killed by state security forces and ethnic @entity2 , with the @entity1 claiming it treated 22 people in the area for weapon wounds . but a government inquiry stated that only one police officer had died . @entity43 said the disagreement over the @entity103 massacre was " not a major issue , " but had been the " final straw " for the @entity2 state government when it came to the @entity10 . " the state government and local people think the @entity1 is intentionally creating tension in the community by spreading baseless information like this , " he said . he also accused the organization of breaching the terms of its @entity125 to operate in @entity4 by denying officials access to its clinic , and by employing " nearly 40 " foreign staff in the state when it was allowed 19 . @entity1 did not respond to the latter allegations , but said it was " extremely concerned about the fate of tens of thousands of vulnerable people in @entity2 who currently face a humanitarian medical crisis .

" that $ 150 - a - month cell phone bill ? gone . it may not be sexy , but a $ 55 prepaid phone has taken its place . when first launching @entity44 , she " decided to take contract or part - time assignments that would allow me to build my business while generating another income to cover my living expenses . i could never have come to this place without living simply and not listening to the ' shoulds . ' " " people do n't know what they actually need . a need is electricity ; a want is cable . " because she does most of her coaching work with entrepreneurs and professionals remotely with clients across the country , she 's not tied to one physical location . @entity5 's real goal is to spend @entity3 's colder months elsewhere -- with her mom in @entity63 , visiting a younger sibling in her native @entity65 -- and downsizing her expenses will give her the freedom to do it . it 's all about choice . the ongoing global recession and the accompanying hit to our pockets , bank accounts and retirement funds , not to mention environmental and ecological concerns , have prompted many folks to reconsider what 's important . and to some , it is n't what they own or what they can buy . instead , it 's about " voluntary downscaling " or learning to live joyfully with less " stuff .

" for some , like @entity5 , whose previous work kept her spinning madly on the 50 - to - 70 - hour workweek treadmill , it 's about purposefully changing careers in order to do something they love , despite the financial downgrade . for others , it might mean selling their cars and relying instead on their feet , public transportation and car - sharing services such as @entity131 in @entity3 and @entity132 in @entity133 to get around . " about half of our members tell us they 're choosing to sell a car or not buy a car because of @entity135 , " said @entity135 chairman and ceo @entity134 , whose car - sharing network serves 250 college campuses and more than 50 cities in @entity140 , and stretches across the @entity141 to the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 . " they also tell us they save on average $ 600 a month , " which he said is roughly the equivalent of getting a $ 10,000 raise after taxes . in many cases , it 's @entity157 , or those born after 1980 , leading the way . a recent @entity135 - commissioned study ( two - thirds of so - called " @entity162 " are under 35 ) found 55 percent of those surveyed have actively made an effort to drive less . while more than half cited " protecting the environment " as one key reason , a whopping 78 percent who are licensed drivers say car ownership is tough because of high gas prices , parking and maintenance costs . the financial savings are huge , but @entity134 said " the real longterm and more emotional connection is around the whole concept of ' less is more . ' " spending on experiences vs. things @entity180 is the @entity181 - based author of " the @entity182 , a @entity183 : how to @entity184 , organize , and @entity185 " whose blog moniker is " @entity188 . " now in her late 30s , she 's been happily living with less for 12 years , thanks to a travel - inspired revelation . " i always packed as lightly as possible , and found it exhilarating to get by with just a small carry - on bag , " said @entity192 . " i thought , wow , if it feels this great to travel lightly , how amazing would it be to live this way ? i wanted to have that same feeling of freedom in my everyday life , so i decided to get rid of all my excess possessions and live with just the essentials . i wanted to spend my time and energy on experiences , rather than things . " a 2009 move -- before which @entity192 and her husband sold their house , most of their possessions and relocated to @entity211 for a stint with only one duffel bag each -- offered another clean slate . " we lived a rather nomadic life for three years , owning only what we could carry in our bags , " she said . " we recently had a baby and are a little more settled now , but still committed to living with as little as possible . although i did n't embrace minimalism for financial reasons , becoming a minimalist is the best thing i 've ever done for my bottom line . " @entity192 's three major lifestyle changes include buying less ( " it 's amazing how much money you save simply by staying out of the stores " ) , decluttering regularly and seeking out versatile items , from dress - ' em - up - or - down ballet flats to multi-purpose cookwear . " i think of minimalism as living with just enough stuff to meet your needs , and nothing in excess . " the ' luxury ' of choice but does simplicity ever feel like a sacrifice ? " oh my goodness , i never think of minimalism as deprivation , " said @entity192 . " rather , it 's eliminating the excess -- unused items , unnecessary purchases , unfulfilling tasks -- from your life . well , i may have fewer possessions , but i have more space . i may have fewer commitments , but i have more time . @entity261 is making room for what matters most . " granted , this is about voluntary downscaling , which by its very definition suggests that those making such choices have the luxury to do so . @entity135 's car - sharing customers , said @entity134 , are better - educated and earn more on average than their similarly aged peers counterparts . " it 's not that they ca n't afford ( owning a car ) ; they 've learned to do the math , " he said . " they 've learned you can have a simpler life and one that 's more sustainable by living with less . " the real questions , said author @entity90 , are : " ' what do you care about ? what do you value ? ' it 's important for people to realize it is n't simply the amount of stuff we consume . it 's about our families , our work , our connection with the larger world , our spiritual dimension . it 's about how we touch the whole world . it 's a way of life . " and downscalers like @entity302 have n't looked back . " the only thing i regret is i did n't understand this eight years ago , " she said . when she shares her living - happily - with-less philosophy , " i hear people say , ' i wish i could do that . ' you can ; you just need to start asking yourself different questions . you have to understand wants vs. needs and start setting yourself up to pursue these things .

@entity56 , the @entity57 militia with ties to @placeholder , claimed responsibility	@entity59	( @entity0 ) -- a brazen , daylight suicide bombing on the @entity4 's peacekeeping mission in @entity6 's capital has killed at least 21 people , mostly peacekeepers , the mission said friday . the attack came days after @entity10 special forces killed @entity11 , pictured , in southern @entity6 . suicide bombers , disguised in two @entity14 - marked vehicles , thursday rammed through the security gate of the mission 's headquarters , which is attached to @entity19 's airport . they detonated their explosives just as @entity6 's transitional government and mission representatives concluded a high - level meeting inside the compound , said the @entity4 's special representative for @entity6 , @entity25 . the attack killed four @entity6 civilians and 17 @entity29 and @entity30 soldiers , including the mission 's second in command , @entity30 maj. gen. @entity34 , he said . the force commander , @entity29 maj. gen. @entity35 , was among the 40 wounded . he assumed command of the @entity37 -- known as @entity37 -- last month . the bombs struck a building that also housed the offices of @entity41 , a @entity10 military contractor that supports the peacekeeping operation , according to @entity25 . it is unclear if any of @entity41 's employees were among those wounded in the strike , and a company representative could not be immediately reached for comment . after the bombings , insurgents fired mortars at the @entity4 compound in an effort to maximize the number of casualties , @entity25 said . @entity56 , the @entity57 militia with ties to @entity59 , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to the @entity4 . the strike happened days after @entity10 special forces targeted and killed a senior @entity59 operative in southern @entity6 . analysts immediately hailed the death of @entity11 on monday as a major blow to @entity59 's efforts to work with @entity56 to try to gain a foothold in the lawless country . days later , however , @entity56 struck back at the most prominent @entity72 - linked target in @entity19 -- the @entity4 peacekeeping mission . the @entity4 has a 3,400 - member peacekeeping force in @entity6 , made up of troops from @entity30 and @entity29 . it operates under a @entity14 mandate to support @entity6 's transitional federal government . the peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in @entity19 , including the port , airport and presidential palace . it is the de facto military force of the weak , transitional @entity6 government . thursday 's bombing was the deadliest attack on @entity4 peacekeepers in @entity19 . it was also a show of force by @entity56 to the @entity90 , particularly after the death of @entity11 , who was considered the main link between @entity59 and @entity56 . @entity25 said he hoped it would " galvanize the international community ... to do more and do better " in helping restore order to @entity6 . " the international community needs to do more , we are not happy with what we have today , " the @entity4 ambassador said . " we need more financial support , military support and the international community needs to deliver that support -- not just deliver lip service . " suicide bombings have become more common as @entity56 strengthens its ties with @entity59 , but the bombers rarely are able to penetrate security as deeply as the attackers apparently did thursday . western countries vowed not to let the attack deter their mission . the @entity14 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity10 and others issued a joint statement vowing " not be deterred by such criminal acts and ( to ) continue all our efforts to ensure the return of peace and stability in @entity6 . " @entity123 helped evacuate 17 of those wounded in thursday 's bombing to a hospital in @entity127 , @entity128 , its foreign ministry said friday . other wounded victims were taken to @entity127 by the @entity127 - based charity group @entity131 . @entity123 and the @entity10 have been supporting @entity6 's transitional government on security issues . the @entity10 is supplying arms to @entity6 forces . @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report	@entity25:Bwakira	@entity29:Uganda	@entity114:Arab League	@entity113:European Union	@entity136:David McKenzie	@entity131:AMREF	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Somali	@entity4:African Union	@entity57:Islamist	@entity56:Al-Shabaab	@entity59:al Qaeda	@entity72:Western	@entity30:Burundi	@entity14:U.N.	@entity35:Nathan Mugisha	@entity34:Juvenal Niyonguruza	@entity11:Nabhan	@entity10:U.S.	@entity19:Mogadishu	@entity128:Kenya	@entity127:Nairobi	@entity123:France	@entity90:West	@entity37:AMISOM	@entity41:DynCorp
new : a @placeholder official says there is no register of @entity1 entering his country	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- for weeks , @entity1 hid from authorities , donning a disguise and using disposable cell phones to communicate . on tuesday , the 67 - year - old internet security pioneer emerged publicly in @entity7 's capital , hundreds of miles away from the @entity9 island in @entity10 where his next - door neighbor was found dead . @entity1 's lawyer said he left @entity10 to escape police persecution and planned to file a formal request for asylum with @entity7 officials wednesday . " he had to come here because it was the closest and the most immediate place to protect his life , " attorney @entity19 told @entity0 en @entity21 ol . @entity1 's arrival in @entity7 was the latest twist in an investigation that has drawn international attention and prompted the well known software company founder to go into hiding for weeks . @entity10 authorities have said they only want to talk to @entity1 about the november 11 shooting death of @entity31 , 52 , an @entity32 businessman who was found dead in his home on the @entity9 island of @entity35 . @entity1 , who is not a suspect in the case , lived next door . " i had nothing to do with his death , " @entity1 wrote on his website tuesday in a message to @entity31 's family . " i have lost five close family members in my 67 years and i know your suffering . " a @entity10 police spokesman said authorities there believe @entity1 could still be in their country , and they still want to question him in his neighbor 's killing . @entity1 , who founded the computer security software company that still bears his name , said in a blog post tuesday that he would speak to @entity10 police on the phone and offered to meet with the @entity61 nation 's prime minister " in a neutral country . " " if i am indeed merely wanted for questioning , " he wrote , " this should suffice . " a @entity7 official said late tuesday that officials there had not received a request for asylum from @entity1 and did not know how he came into the country . there is no registry of @entity1 entering legally at any official border crossing , said @entity74 , director of international bilateral relations for @entity7 's foreign ministry . " everything we know about this case comes from the media , " he said . the @entity7 official said he could not comment on whether his country would offer asylum to @entity1 , since no request had been filed . earlier tuesday , a @entity10 police spokesman said authorities thought @entity1 was still in that country , but declined to say why . " we 're not even sure he 's left @entity10 , " said @entity88 , spokesman for the @entity89 . " he said a lot of things . the police feel he 's still here in @entity10 . " it 's difficult to pinpoint what he will say next or what he will do next . i still question his frame of mind , " @entity88 said . " i think the best thing is for him to come in and answer a couple of questions . " @entity10 wo n't seek extradition of @entity1 , @entity88 said . authorities are n't unfairly persecuting @entity1 , and his attorney " should come to @entity10 and see what 's happening here , " @entity88 said . in an exclusive interview with @entity0 earlier this week , @entity1 said he fears authorities in @entity10 and said he 'd been afraid for his life ever since he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier . @entity88 said the interview showed @entity1 was trying to use media , especially international outlets , " as pawns in his game for sympathy . " " i think he really wants to make this into a great fiasco , " he said . " he 's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad , and we just believe he should , if he 's innocent as he 's saying he is , he should bring in his lawyer , and let 's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let 's move on , " @entity88 said . " i 'm sure he could be somebody who could direct the course of this investigation . " on his website , @entity1 said he has hired @entity19 " to assist in my fight against the government of @entity10 " and apologized for the secrecy surrounding his relocation . he did not provide details about how -- or when -- he arrived in @entity7 . " it was not easy to exit @entity10 and required many supporters in many countries , " he wrote . he said he planned to meet with @entity7 officials and hoped to speak to reporters in a news conference wednesday . @entity1 founded his namesake computer security software in 1987 , initially running it out of his home in @entity151 . he sold his stake in @entity153 in 1994 and moved to @entity10 in 2008 . the case began to unfold on november 9 , when @entity1 told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs . to put them out of their misery , he shot each in the head and buried them on his property , a former girlfriend said . officials say the dogs ' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between @entity1 and @entity31 , a contractor who retired to @entity10 from @entity174 and lived next door . @entity1 lived in the remote northern part of @entity35 . two days later , someone shot @entity31 in the head in his own living room . a 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor , and @entity31 was found dead on the second floor . @entity1 told @entity0 in the interview that he did not kill @entity185 and did not pay anybody to kill the man . he said he will not surrender to police for questioning , adding that his priority is to clear his name . three people have been detained for questioning in the killing , police have said , and investigators are pursuing multiple leads . a 2009 story in the @entity197 indicated that @entity1 's fortune had plunged to $ 4 million from its $ 100 million peak , largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments . in february 2010 , he started @entity205 , which says on its website to be trying to " reinvent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria .

the issue is expected to be conclusively decided by the @entity19 @placeholder	@entity72	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a federal appeals court in @entity0 became the nation 's second to strike down the @entity5 , finding that the @entity8 - era law 's denial of federal benefits to married same - sex couples is unconstitutional . the divisive act , which was passed in 1996 , bars federal recognition of such marriages and says other states can not be forced to recognize them . read the ruling ( @entity17 ) the 2nd @entity19 @entity18 determined thursday that the federal law violates the @entity22 's equal protection clause , ruling in favor of widow @entity24 , an 83 - year - old lesbian who sued the federal government for charging her more than $ 363,000 in estate taxes after being denied the benefit of spousal deductions . the court upheld a lower court 's decision in a 2 - 1 majority ruling and determined that @entity19 's gay population " has suffered a history of discrimination " similar to that faced by women in years past . " what i 'm feeling is elated , " said @entity24 . " did i ever think it could come to be , altogether ? ... not a chance in hell . " victory for @entity24 , years after her longtime partner 's death the case centered on the money @entity24 wanted back , but it raised the more looming question of whether the federal government can continue to ignore a state 's recognition of her marriage and financially penalize her as a result . timeline : same - sex marriage " homosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public , " wrote @entity61 , a conservative judge in @entity0 . a federal appeals court in @entity68 made a similar ruling in may , but the moves are considered largely symbolic as the issue is expected to eventually be taken up by the @entity19 @entity72 . man tells senators : @entity5 cost me my home " this court has a limited jurisdiction , " @entity1 legal analyst @entity77 said .

" those who back striking down the law " believe this decision will give them a very strong position arguing before the @entity19 @entity72 in the future , " he said . @entity0 gov. @entity90 also weighed in on the three - judge - panel 's decision , saying it " provides further momentum for national progress on this important civil rights issue . " @entity68 appeals court rules @entity5 unconstitutional in february , the @entity99 administration ordered the @entity100 to stop defending the constitutionality of the law , though a @entity104 - backed group has since taken up the issue in courts across the country . @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity0 and the @entity114 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples . @entity116 , @entity114 , @entity117 and @entity118 are voting on the issue in november referendums . five states -- @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage . thursday 's ruling was celebrated by many top @entity130 , including @entity132 minority leader @entity131 , gay and civil rights advocacy groups such as @entity136 and the @entity137 , and former @entity139 gov. @entity138 , the @entity140 's presidential nominee . others criticized the ruling , including @entity144 president @entity143 . he said 32 states have , by popular vote , backed a traditional definition of marriage being between a man and a woman and expressed hope the @entity72 will decide the matter .

" the @entity1 government claims the private contractors , who were guarding a @entity24 diplomatic convoy , killed as many as 20 civilians . @entity1 officials , who claim the shootings were unprovoked , dispute @entity8 's claim that the guards were responding to an attack and said on saturday they had a videotape showing the @entity8 guards opened fire without provocation . the incident prompted the @entity1 government to call for @entity8 's expulsion from the country and sparked anger among @entity1 . watch a report on @entity8 's response to the allegations ¬ª @entity61 spokesman @entity60 said earlier this week the @entity8 employees involved in the incident were still in @entity1 . word of @entity1 's intent to file charges came as no surprise . one day after the shooting , @entity1 prime minister @entity68 said his government would punish those responsible . on sunday , rear adm. @entity76 , @entity75 chief for @entity77 , and dr. @entity78 , civilian spokesman for the @entity73 , refused to comment on @entity1 's plan to file charges . but they gave some details on a joint @entity24 - @entity1 commission that would examine issues of security and safety in the aftermath of the shooting . the commission -- to be co-chaired by @entity1 minister of defense @entity88 and @entity89 , the charge d'affaires of the @entity24 embassy -- will receive the results of both a @entity61 investigation and the separate @entity1 investigation in the next few days , @entity76 and @entity78 said . @entity8 contractors are part of the estimated 25,000 - plus employees of private security firms who are working in @entity1 , guarding diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials . as many as 200 security contractors have been killed in @entity1 , according to @entity24 congressional reports . @entity8 resumed its normal operations of providing security to @entity24 civilian authorities in @entity1 on friday after a hiatus sparked by concerns among @entity1 and @entity24 government officials over last weekend 's shootings . @entity78 said the @entity1 government has allowed @entity8 to again operate in the streets of @entity1 because , otherwise , @entity24 troops would have to be pulled from the field to provide security . meanwhile , 19 bodies were found by @entity1 police in @entity0 over the weekend , an @entity116 official told @entity2 on sunday . the total number of bodies reported to be found in the capital this month is 251 . e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity124 contributed to this report .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Iraqi	@entity0:Baghdad	@entity26:Congressional Research Service	@entity141:Provisional Authority	@entity24:U.S.	@entity4:Iraqi Interior Ministry	@entity28:Coalition Provisional Authority	@entity8:Blackwater	@entity60:Sean McCormack	@entity116:Interior Ministry	@entity78:Sheikhly	@entity68:Nuri al-Maliki	@entity75:Communications Division	@entity88:Abd al Qadir	@entity89:Patricia A.

@entity162 : spending on booze , bondage club comes when @placeholder hoping to win 2010 midterms	@entity22	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 chairman @entity1 might be reminding conservative activists of a past @entity2 leadership turned arrogant with power . under @entity1 's leadership , the @entity2 has been accused of spending campaign funds on private jets , booze , limousines , five - star hotels , overseas resorts and a party donor 's trip to a @entity16 bondage club . most conservatives will agree that these expenditures are a horrible waste of funds at a time when republicans are hoping to enjoy sizable gains in the 2010 midterm elections . after the devastating results of the 2006 and 2008 elections , conservatives were unexpectedly able to energize their followers as the @entity30 movement emerged and president @entity31 experienced first - year difficulties . local @entity2 victories in gubernatorial elections in @entity35 and @entity36 boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared @entity38 might be on the verge of another @entity40 . but along comes the @entity2 scandals , which have had the exact opposite effect . @entity43 , the president of the @entity44 , told his followers that they should not write checks to the national party . @entity43 said : " this latest incident is another indication to me the @entity2 is completely tone - deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people they are seeking financial support from . " the @entity2 scandals smack of the type of arrogance that was at the heart of the scandals that brought down key @entity22 in 2005 and 2006 . during these critical years , it became clear that party leaders had been abusing their influence by focusing on expanding their own power rather than advancing the agenda of the right . @entity67 majority leader @entity66 was forced to resign in early 2006 after being accused of violating campaign finance laws in @entity69 . he was also tied to the lobbying scandals that centered on @entity71 . @entity73 rep. @entity72 ended his career for accepting bribes from defense contractors who benefited from his decisions on appropriations . there was also the case of @entity84 rep. @entity83 , to whom @entity2 leaders turned a blind eye despite his highly inappropriate text messages to underage male pages . even @entity88 , the darling of the @entity90 , had been in cahoots with @entity71 in schemes to mobilize activists to protest gaming with the intention of drumming up business for his long - time friend . it seemed that the attitude of @entity22 in @entity101 had become " anything goes . " the results were devastating . many republicans were forced to resign , and @entity38 regained control of @entity106 in 2006 . polls showed that corruption was a major issue on @entity110 . the chickens had come home to roost . not only did the scandals offer campaign fodder for @entity38 who wanted to challenge the @entity22 ' self - promotion as the righteous party , but even more importantly , they deflated the enthusiasm of conservative activists who believed their energy and money had been wasted and that their party was just as corrupt as the opposition . rather than the party of @entity125 , the @entity22 looked more like the party of @entity127 . the @entity1 scandals point to that same kind of arrogance . this time around , @entity22 are in an even weaker position , given that they are in the minority and out of the @entity67 , struggling to rebuild their battered party . in addition , @entity38 have just achieved a major victory with health care , and it seems that the jobs market is finally starting to improve . republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of @entity101 than in the more modest ways of @entity143 . on monday , the @entity2 chief of staff resigned , with many assuming he was fired by @entity1 in an effort to clean house . the resignation is a start . but much more needs to be done . if the @entity2 leadership does not respond more aggressively , recent efforts to revive the party wo n't amount to very much . conservative voters will not be enthusiastic about supporting a party whose leaders partake in lavish and questionable activities , and @entity38 will have more evidence that their opponents can not be trusted with power . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .	@entity22:GOP	@entity30:Tea Party	@entity83:Mark Foley	@entity84:Florida	@entity110:Election Day	@entity88:Ralph Reed	@entity2:RNC	@entity1:Michael Steele	@entity0:CNN	@entity71:Abramoff	@entity73:California	@entity72:Duke Cunningham	@entity31:Obama	@entity16:Hollywood	@entity35:Virginia	@entity36:New Jersey	@entity38:Democrats	@entity69:Texas	@entity101:Washington	@entity106:Congress	@entity127:Tammany Hall	@entity125:Ronald Reagan	@entity90:Christian Coalition	@entity162:Zelizer	@entity143:Main Street	@entity44:Family Research Council	@entity40:New Deal	@entity43:Perkins	@entity66:Tom DeLay	@entity67:White House
the incident happened before a presidential trip to the @placeholder in @entity8	@entity107	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity5 director @entity4 has cooperated properly with congressional investigators looking into the prostitution scandal in @entity8 last month before president @entity10 's visit , influential @entity3 members said wednesday . rep. @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity12 , said @entity4 provided answers to 50 questions from his panel about the controversy in @entity17 that embarrassed the nearly 150 - year - old agency and raised concerns of a possible security breach . " i got the answers back last night , and i would say the answers were very detailed , " @entity11 said on @entity1 's " @entity21 with @entity22 . " in addition , @entity11 said , @entity4 notified the @entity27 's inspector general when the scandal became public in mid-april , " which showed that he wanted a real investigation . " also wednesday , the @entity32 's leading members said @entity4 provided a " detailed response " to their separate list of questions about the incident . " director @entity4 's cooperation with our oversight efforts underscores his commitment to understand the extent of the problem and ensure that this unacceptable conduct does not occur again , " said a statement by the panel 's chairman , @entity40 , @entity41 , and ranking @entity42 , @entity43 of @entity44 . even @entity54 sen. @entity53 of @entity55 , a frequent critic of government resistance to congressional oversight , praised @entity4 's response to his request for details of any possible involvement of @entity3 advance team staff in the scandal . @entity53 is demanding that the @entity3 turn over all details of an internal review that found no wrongdoing by advance staff members , and he renewed his call wednesday after receiving @entity4 's response that the @entity5 inquiry did n't involve @entity3 records . " since the @entity5 did not request the records of the @entity3 personnel , an open and transparent response from the president 's counsel is even more imperative , " @entity53 said in a statement . " unfortunately , more than a week after my inquiry , i 've yet to hear from anybody at the @entity3 . i appreciate the @entity5 's transparency in response to @entity82 , even with sensitive information . " @entity11 said tuesday night that @entity4 's answers to his committee 's questions disclosed that three of the 12 @entity5 agents involved in the scandal had refused to cooperate with authorities and submit to a polygraph test . the three agents were among the first forced out of the service when news of the scandal in @entity17 broke , @entity11 said . the nine remaining agents took polygraph tests , and although none of them failed , some responses led to the loss of several jobs , he added . on wednesday morning , @entity11 said that no security breach occurred from the @entity5 agents consorting with foreign prostitutes in their hotel rooms shortly before @entity10 's arrival in @entity17 for last month 's @entity107 . " we know that it appears that no material was obtained by any of the prostitutes . nothing is missing . all the @entity113 are accounted for . there was no president 's schedule available , " @entity11 said . " it does not appear that any of the 12 women had any involvement other than prostitution , " @entity11 added . " they were not working for any narco - terrorist organization , and i think in a way the @entity5 has ducked a bullet . " still , @entity11 said , the incident " goes against all the principles of the @entity5 . " " because it was disclosed and there was no long - term security matter here , it gives the @entity5 the opportunity to clear up what has happened , do all it can to make sure it never happens again or at least minimizes it to make it very , very difficult for it to ever happen again , " he said . while @entity11 did not provide @entity1 copies of the responses -- which he said are marked " law enforcement sensitive " -- he highlighted several details tuesday night . among other things , one agent said in the polygraph test that he was " actively engaged " with one of the prostitutes when she wanted to get paid , @entity11 said . in response , the agent threw her out of his room . the agent told @entity147 officials he did n't realize the woman was a prostitute , and he has not been fired . @entity147 officials have interviewed 10 of the 12 women involved in the scandal , @entity11 noted . the @entity5 and @entity8 authorities are trying to track down the remaining two . @entity11 said there were n't many surprises in the responses to his questionnaire . " @entity4 was giving us good information all along , " he said . the top legislators on the @entity159 said tuesday that they 've also sent a letter to @entity4 asking for information on the incident . a total of nine agents have resigned or are in the process of being forced out , while three other @entity5 agents were cleared of serious misconduct . a source familiar with the investigation told @entity1 on wednesday that money changed hands between nine @entity5 members and nine prostitutes . the military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 of its service members . @entity40 and @entity43 also have asked defense secretary @entity177 to provide details of the military investigation by may 8 . two other congressional committees are looking into the scandal , as well as the @entity27 inspector general , while the @entity5 and the @entity3 have conducted internal reviews . on monday , @entity27 acting inspector general @entity184 announced his investigation of the incident , saying the " field work is beginning immediately . " the @entity188 questioned homeland security secretary @entity189 about the controversy at a hearing last week . on tuesday , sen. @entity192 , an independent from @entity194 who chairs the @entity196 , and ranking @entity54 sen. @entity197 said they sent @entity4 a letter monday that also sought answers about what happened . " we wish to determine whether those events were indicative of a pattern of behavior by agents or officers of the @entity5 and need to be addressed systemically or if they instead constituted an isolated incident warranting action only with respect to the individuals involved , " said the letter from @entity192 and @entity202 . the @entity216 expects to finish questioning the 12 military personnel implicated in possible wrongdoing this week before forwarding its findings to military lawyers for review and then to gen. @entity222 , commanding general of the @entity216 , a @entity215 official said monday . last week , the @entity5 distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct , according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation . @entity234 , the new guidelines given to all @entity5 personnel , make clear that standards of behavior required in the @entity147 apply on missions abroad , the sources said . effective immediately , the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are " off - limits " for @entity5 personnel , the sources said . also in the new standards , foreigners are banned from @entity5 hotel rooms at all times , except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business , according to the officials , and all @entity5 personnel are prohibited from going to a " nonreputable establishment . " the new standards specify that @entity147 laws apply to @entity5 personnel when traveling , rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country , the officials said . in addition , the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying , the officials explained . an additional supervisor from the @entity271 will now accompany the " jump teams " that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation , the officials said . agents involved in the @entity8 incident were part of such a jump team . allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes last month before @entity10 arrived in @entity17 . recent claims include an account from @entity288 described by @entity290 affiliate @entity289 as very similar to the @entity8 scandal , involving members of the @entity5 and other government agencies . however , @entity177 said last week that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in @entity288 , while @entity298 spokesman @entity297 said @entity300 staff in @entity288 were being questioned about the allegations . the @entity306 also is prepared to look into , " in an appropriate manner and immediately , " allegations that it deems " credible " regarding its agents in @entity288 , spokesman @entity302 said . but he added that , while the @entity306 had seen news reports , " we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct .

@entity18 and @placeholder of @entity10 win with sweet pop song " @entity17 "	@entity19	( @entity0 ) -- while several @entity6 countries have long had their own versions of " @entity8 , " the longest running televised pop music competition where fans choose their favorite songs and singers is @entity6 's @entity9 , now in its 56th year . saturday evening , @entity10 won the 2011 running of the annual competition , with a sweet pop song that @entity6 slowly fell in love with during the course of the contest , titled " @entity17 , " by @entity18 and @entity19 ( also known as @entity20 / @entity19 ) . the song , somewhat of a surprise winner to many , beat out early favorites from @entity24 and @entity25 to win over @entity26 and @entity27 . @entity27 's @entity28 was winning the contest in the early going , until it became apparent that @entity18 and @entity19 would run away with a trophy . ironically , @entity27 @entity31 and @entity32 wrote @entity10 's song , making saturday night a win for @entity27 all around -- @entity28 came in third at the competition . @entity26 's @entity37 was second . but the true victors saturday were @entity10 's @entity18 and @entity19 , who seemed stunned yet ecstatic just after the ceremony . " we 're very happy right now . ... we 're very proud , " said @entity20 at a post-show press conference . the winner was determined by fans across @entity6 who voted by phone , and a jury made up of music industry professionals . saturday 's final capped off two weeks of fanfare surrounding the event , and followed two semifinals and a kind of dress rehearsal , a jury final , on friday evening . some 36,000 watched saturday 's @entity54 event live from a stadium in @entity56 , @entity57 , which was chosen as the host city for 2011 after @entity57 won the song competition in 2010 with @entity61 's " satellite . " it was the first time in 28 years @entity57 had played host to @entity9 fans . @entity61 , who represented @entity57 again in 2011 to defend her title , did not do quite as well this year , with her " @entity66 " placing 10th . " satellite " wowed crowds last year , making @entity61 a star in @entity57 seen often on tv and on billboards . ratings for saturday 's grand finale fared well around @entity6 , but within @entity57 , semifinal viewership was down this year , with some @entity57 newspapers citing " @entity61 fatigue " as one reason fewer @entity57 seemed excited in 2011 for the annual pop music contest . conversely , interest in the annual competition spiked this year in @entity25 - speaking countries , largely due to strong contenders from both the @entity83 ( contemporary boy band @entity84 ) and @entity85 , which sent a pair of identical twins ( @entity88 ) . @entity90 ratings for both semifinals earlier this week nearly doubled last year 's numbers . the number of @entity25 and @entity85 fans also seemed high saturday night in @entity57 , where @entity83 tourists swarmed @entity56 's arena , showing patriotism with the kind of colorful clothing usually reserved for soccer matches . ratings for saturday 's final were also up in @entity102 and @entity103 compared with 2010 viewership , according to newspaper reports . so what 's behind the enduring appeal of the @entity9 for fans from as far away as @entity110 ? according to @entity111 , who wrote " the @entity9 : the @entity117 , " it 's a mix of curiosity and love of music . " you can come at it from any angle you like , " he said outside the arena friday before the jury final , which precedes the actual grand final and makes up 50 % of the vote determining who wins the annual competition . " one can watch it to see how appallingly bad the talent will be , or one can watch it to see how good it 's going to be . ... neither of those opinions is invalid , " he said . " it 's an entertainment show . " and the entertainment was there during saturday 's @entity54 , with production values approaching something like a @entity141 concert -- think state - of - the - art indoor pyrotechnics and lighting displays tailored to each individual country 's stage set . while many @entity147 were unaware the competition took place this past week , the @entity147 did have a stake in the game , via a few @entity147 - based songwriters , who were likely watching online saturday , awaiting results . @entity155 - based songwriters in particular were paying attention . @entity157 and @entity158 wrote @entity61 's " @entity66 , " while @entity161 ' @entity160 co-wrote @entity162 ' " @entity159 " for @entity163 . but the biggest @entity155 - based name who generated interest in @entity9 this year was @entity168 producer @entity167 . the songsmith co-wrote @entity171 's entry for 2011 , @entity172 's " get you , " which did n't fare as well saturday night as many had hoped , yet still impressed many . " the universal language is music , " the songwriter said from a private pressroom before the event saturday night , after a crush of @entity171 photographers snapped pictures of him and @entity172 together . " all the borders are falling away ( because of the @entity187 ) , " said the hitmaker , currently riding high on world pop charts with his and @entity185 's hot " @entity184 . " " @entity190 has no boundaries , " he added , noting he had been tweeting about his newly signed @entity171 artist , @entity172 , who performed in the finals saturday . " i grew up watching @entity9 , " said the producer , who lived in @entity27 before immigrating to @entity147 . so will @entity147 care next year about a televised song competition which does n't air in the @entity147 ? @entity167 , for one , hopes so . " it 's a beautiful contest because it 's all about the songs and the artists , " he said . " it 's like ' @entity8 , ' but with original songs . americans should really get into it .

@placeholder died of natural causes at his @entity7 home	@entity4	there are n't many @entity2 players who influenced the game like @entity4 . @entity4 , 74 , who died monday of natural causes his @entity7 home , proved himself many times over as arguably the sport 's most fearsome defensive lineman . he invented his own weapon on the field of battle : the head slap . he created his own statistic on the @entity2 record books : the quarterback sack . " i developed a term that is used in the game right now called sacking the quarterback , " @entity4 is quoted on @entity2 . " sacking a quarterback is just like you devastate a city or you cream a multitude of people . i mean it 's just like you put all the offensive players in one bag and i just take a baseball bat and beat on the bag . " clearly , @entity4 did n't mince words . advertising execs on @entity34 played on @entity4 ' tough - guy persona with a series of memorable tv beer commercials for @entity38 . dressed in a black leather jacket , @entity4 marches into a bar and recites a poem about the virtues of the beer , and then warns , " and if you do n't believe me , i 'm gon na break your nose . " the numbers alone tell the tale : the 6 - foot - 5 - inch tall @entity4 piled up 173 sacks during a 14 - year career with the @entity50 , the @entity51 and the @entity52 . that 's second only to @entity54 . " @entity4 was one of the greatest players in @entity2 history , " said @entity52 general manager @entity55 . " off the field , he was a true giant . his passion and spirit will continue to inspire those who knew him . " @entity64 were n't even an official @entity2 statistic until 1982 , long after @entity4 ' retirement . then there was the head slap -- the brain - jarring swipe of a defensive lineman 's hand or arm against the helmet of his opponent . " @entity4 could split helmets with his head slap , and his outside speed rush was devastating , " wrote @entity76 , aka @entity76 , in @entity78 . " plus , @entity4 was relentless ; he never gave up . he collected sacks on his hands and knees . " @entity4 started his @entity2 career in 1961 with the @entity50 and spent 11 seasons there . along with fellow icons @entity88 , @entity90 and @entity91 , @entity4 formed one of the best defensive lines of all time : the @entity95 . as a @entity96 , @entity4 perfected the head slap . @entity4 once said he wished that , after messing with him , opposing players would wake up " hopefully on tuesday . " you could say it was effective . so effective , the @entity2 banned it . " his eyes were as red as fire , and after he took his stance , he was pawing his leg in the dirt like a bull , " remembered @entity102 of his first @entity2 start . @entity102 , playing with the @entity111 , was facing @entity4 in that 1969 game . " as an offensive lineman , you 're taught only to hear the quarterback 's voice . nothing else , " @entity102 said in the @entity78 interview . " i 'm listening in case there 's an audible , and in the pause between ' huts ! ' i hear a deep , heavy voice say , ' does yo ' mama know you 're out here ? ' it was @entity4 .

report says 2,000 children a year are trafficked to the @placeholder	@entity51	( @entity0 ) -- more than 50 children have been abducted in @entity2 since the beginning of the year , adding to a trend of kidnappings in countries affected by violence , according to a @entity9 report . @entity2 demonstrate june 4 in @entity10 against the kidnappings and acts of violence in @entity2 . " it is everyone 's duty to ensure children are safe from harm , and governments have a responsibility to enact and enforce measures that provide a protective environment for all children , " the agency said in a statement released friday . in countries torn by war , like the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , food shortages and poverty have added to the already hellish conditions children live in . the youngest in unstable countries have become primary targets for armed groups who see them as commodities , the agency said . in @entity2 , @entity9 and local officials report that kidnapped children are being raped , tortured and murdered . the @entity44 has been working with the national police force to try to halt such crimes . they suspect that criminal gangs are responsible . the agency reports that as many as 2,000 children a year are trafficked to the @entity51 , often with their parents ' support . and about 1,000 children are working as spies , messengers or soldiers for armed gangs in the @entity2 capital of @entity10 . earlier in the month , a demonstration was held in @entity2 's capital after a 16 - year - old hostage was murdered and other hostages had been raped and lynched , including infants , @entity9 said . the agency urged officials to take action . " there is no acceptable motive or rationale for these crimes , as there is no acceptable excuse that they should be allowed to continue with flagrant impunity , " @entity9 's @entity2 representative , @entity68 , said in a statement . the agency recently received reports that @entity30 children have been recruited by militia and insurgent groups . " girls are increasingly subject to murder , kidnapping and rape , or are being abducted and trafficked within or outside @entity30 for sexual exploitation , " according to the report . in the @entity28 , the agency reports that armed gangs terrorize farms and communities , kidnapping children and holding them for ransom . @entity95 , in @entity96 , recounts to @entity9 how bandits broke into his home nearly two years ago and kidnapped his wife , newborn baby and two other children -- @entity102 and @entity103 -- after killing older family members , including an uncle and a grandfather . " it was two in the morning when they came . there were many of them , and they knocked down the doors , " @entity95 tells @entity9 in a video posted on the agency 's web site . @entity95 was shot in the back during the attack , @entity9 said . " they had kalashnikovs , and the bullets came down like rain , " he said . for two years , now - 5 - year - old @entity102 and his 7 - year - old sister , @entity103 , were held in bush camps because their father could n't afford to be in a position where he might have to pay a ransom . it had financially broken him when he paid to free his wife and newborn baby , @entity9 said . @entity95 tells @entity9 that the children lived in horrible conditions that included beatings . " @entity102 still wakes up at night ; he shouts and cries . " when someone mentions kidnapping , @entity103 stops talking . " whenever she hears that word , she stops talking ; she tells us to ' keep quiet of such things ' and asks for peace , " her father said . " we were afraid , but we kept thinking our father would come soon , " @entity102 told the agency . " ' i 'm happy to come back home . ... thanks , we 're free . ' " although some children are returned to their homes , other kidnapped children may never return . they are instead used as muscle behind rebel militias in countries like the @entity29 . the agency added that many children are also held in captivity and used as sexual slaves . in a july 2006 @entity9 report on child soldiers in the nation , the agency reported that " as many as 30,000 children may be associated with armed forces or groups as fighters , sexual slaves and camp - followers . " of those children , the report estimates , " 30 to 40 percent of children associated with armed forces are girls .

[ @entity2 ] is in jail . she can still see her little girl grow up , " @entity2 's uncle , @entity37 , told @entity14 . he said the family is " shell - shocked " and hopes that in time they can learn to trust people again . " who can you trust at this point ? " he said . " who do you know ? " a police spokesman told reporters saturday he " could n't begin to theorize " a motive for @entity2 's death . watch police discuss the arrest ¬ª @entity2 is the granddaughter of @entity56 , pastor at the @entity57 , which was searched as part of the investigation , @entity24 police sgt. @entity54 told reporters . @entity2 taught @entity61 at the church , he said . in addition , @entity2 's 5 - year - old daughter was close friends with @entity2 , who often played at @entity2 's home . earlier saturday , @entity54 said he did not believe @entity2 had retained an attorney . in a friday interview with the @entity70 newspaper , @entity2 acknowledged owning the black rolling suitcase that held @entity2 's body , but said she reported it missing the day before the girl 's body was found . she said it disappeared the same day the girl was last seen . " there 's been a lot of speculation on the news about what happened to my suitcase , " she told the newspaper . " it 's not my granddad 's . it 's mine , and someone took it . " police said @entity2 lives in the same mobile home complex where @entity2 lived with her family ; the @entity70 reported @entity2 lives with her grandparents . police noted " inconsistencies " between comments @entity2 made to the newspaper and a previous statement she gave authorities , @entity54 said . it was one reason police asked her friday to come to the station to be interviewed again . she drove there about 6 p.m. friday , he said . authorities believe @entity2 lied about the suitcase being missing , @entity54 said . asked whether authorities believe @entity2 's death was planned , @entity54 said the question is " not something i can answer right now " but " we do have an indication . " he said authorities have found where they believe the girl was killed , but would not divulge that location to reporters . " i could n't begin to theorize what her motive is , " @entity54 said of @entity2 . during the friday night interview with police , @entity2 was " very relaxed for a bit , and then she became very emotional , and then she became relaxed again " before appearing resigned , @entity54 said . he declined to say whether @entity2 had confessed , but said " she revealed enough information that we had probable cause to arrest her .

" we no longer have any captives , " @placeholder commander @entity43 says	@entity10	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- members of @entity5 's largest guerrilla group declared thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with @entity8 government negotiators for peace talks next month . the @entity10 -- known by the @entity12 acronym @entity10 -- have waged a bloody civil war for five decades with the @entity8 government and right - wing paramilitary groups . the group is considered by the @entity18 government to be a terrorist organization . the discussions will begin on october 8 in @entity22 , @entity23 , six @entity10 members said during a news conference held in @entity0 on thursday . time is right , but past failures haunt @entity8 peace talks @entity28 , @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity23 have been named as countries that will aid in the negotiations . @entity8 president @entity32 said tuesday he supports the effort and named government negotiators to attempt to hammer out a treaty . a possible peace deal will face many obstacles , including long - standing allegations that @entity10 guerrillas have enriched themselves with ransoms paid for kidnap victims and with drug trafficking . @entity10 commander @entity43 denied reports that guerrillas still hold prisoners in remote jungle camps . " we no longer have any captives , " @entity43 said before asserting that kidnappings by criminal and paramilitary organizations are often blamed on the @entity10 . negotiations between the @entity10 and the @entity8 government broke down over 10 years ago . then - president @entity54 had ceded an area the size of @entity57 to the guerrilla group at the start of those peace talks . the government later said the guerrillas had used the area as a base for drug trafficking and kidnapping . former @entity8 president @entity67 says it is impossible to hold peace talks without first securing a unilateral cease fire and criticized the proposed negotiations . five facts about @entity8 's @entity10 rebels @entity43 said a cease fire would be proposed as soon as negotiators meet next month , but the @entity10 is prepared to continue fighting . " there 's enough of us to keep taking the fight to the government , " he said . as part of a road map for a possible peace deal , the @entity10 has said the government will need to enact land reform for peasant farmers , help coca growers plant other crops and reintegrate thousands of @entity10 soldiers into @entity8 society . @entity10 representatives also decried @entity8 's extradition treaty with the @entity18 , which has led to the convictions of several @entity10 commanders there . " anyone who breaks the law in @entity8 should be tried in @entity8 , " said @entity10 negotiator @entity96 . " there 's no need that anyone should be turned over to another country . " the issue could prove to be the first challenge to the talks , since the @entity10 named commander @entity106 as a member of the team who will negotiate a possible peace deal . @entity106 is serving 60 years in a @entity18 federal prison after a 2007 conviction on drug trafficking and terrorism charges . @entity10 negotiators refused to say at the news conference whether @entity118 's inclusion is symbolic or if his release is an initial demand to the @entity8 government .

@entity1 politician @placeholder is on trial for terrorism , banditry and insurgency	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the trial of controversial @entity1 politician @entity4 took a new twist tuesday when prosecutors told the judge they wanted to impeach their star witness . the prosecution called arms dealer @entity10 to the stand to implicate @entity4 in the procurement of the arms . @entity4 is a senior official of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and @entity1 's deputy agriculture minister - designate . he has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism and inciting people to carry out terrorism . he could face the death penalty if convicted . the @entity15 -- led by prime minister @entity22 -- says the case against @entity4 is politically motivated and was aimed at keeping him out of the unity government it formed with president @entity27 's @entity26 last february . under questioning from attorney general @entity28 , @entity10 testified he had seen @entity4 on television and then had met him at a public gathering . but @entity10 told the fully packed courtroom that he was not aware of some of the weapons the prosecution claims that he bought with the financial support of @entity4 . in addition , @entity10 -- who appeared relaxed throughout the proceedings -- cast doubt on the authenticity of e-mails that were produced in court which the prosecution said had been retrieved from his laptop and which allegedly reveal that he and @entity4 were planning to commit terrorism . " none of the contents was retrieved from my laptop in my absence or in the presence of my legal counsel ( in 2006 when he was arrested ) , " he said , adding , " i do n't know here they came from . " after that , @entity28 started questioning @entity10 as if he were a hostile witness and not the star witness for the prosecution . @entity4 's lawyers objected , saying the prosecution was trying to " confuse " people . at that point , @entity28 indicated that he was in the " preparatory stage " to " to lay evidence that @entity10 was being inconsistent . " " the witness -- who is an accomplice witness by the way -- is getting to be a witness in favor of the accused ; we are entitled to start impeachment procedures when the state witness starts showing that he is being unfavorably indisposed in favor of the accused , " he added . @entity4 's lawyer , @entity71 , said the prosecution had never indicated that it had e-mails which were purportedly written by her client and @entity10 . she said @entity10 had submitted an affidavit saying he does not want to testify against @entity4 , adding that the statements about conspiracy that were purportedly made by him were done under " traumatic and unfriendly circumstances " in 2006 , when he was arrested and later charged with terrorism himself . @entity71 said the prosecution was attempting to take a statement @entity10 made to the army and turn it into a statement against her client . " that is an army - procured statement . what legal basis is there to change it to a witness statement ? the statement was made when he was an accused facing conspiracy charges , " said @entity71 . " during that time the prosecution did not indicate that he had acted in common purpose with the accused ( @entity4 ) . " @entity10 was acquitted of terrorism charges in 2006 but served a jail sentence for the lesser charge of possessing weapons without a license . the weapons allegedly included six sub-machine guns and two machine guns , which the prosecution produced in @entity4 's trial as part of the state 's exhibits . the judge in the case , justice @entity109 , who resumed the trial after adjourning it last november , is expected to rule wednesday whether the state can proceed to impeach its own witness . throughout the court proceedings , @entity4 -- clad in a blue suit , matching blue tie and a light blue shirt -- sat motionless , gazing into the sky once in a while . he laughed out loud when @entity10 said he first saw @entity4 on television punching the justice minister in parliament .	@entity22:Morgan Tsvangirai	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Zimbabwe	@entity0:Harare	@entity26:Zanu-PF party	@entity27:Robert Mugabe	@entity10:Hitschmann	@entity28:Tomana	@entity4:Bennett	@entity15:MDC	@entity109:Chinembiri Bhunu	@entity71:Mtetwa	@entity130:Micheal Peter Hitschmann

@placeholder boat builder plans to restore @entity50	@entity22	( @entity0 ) -- one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . admittedly , it helps if the trash comes from one of the most famous billionaire businessmen on the planet . when @entity12 zipped across the @entity13 in the record - breaking time of three days , eight hours and 31 minutes , in 1986 , his magnificent powerboat was held up as the cutting edge of design . but almost 30 years later , the $ 2.3 million @entity16 which captured our imaginations , had been left to rot in a remote @entity20 boatyard . until now . a @entity22 boat builder -- who as a teenager watched @entity12 thump across the waves in style -- has rescued the iconic powerboat from the scrapyard in an ambitious plan to restore her to former glory . " she looked so sorry for herself , tucked away in this boatyard , surrounded by numerous other boats rotting away in a type of nautical graveyard , " said boat builder and new owner , @entity39 . " it was such an amazing boat and an amazing achievement -- a piece of maritime history . we want to restore her and bring her back to the @entity22 where she belongs . " @entity12 himself has backed the ambitious project , tweeting : " so many memories on @entity50 , would be great to see it back on the ocean . " indeed , footage of a young @entity55 speeding from @entity56 to @entity22 's @entity57 in a sleek 22 - meter powerboat , epitomized the technological spirit of the era . after all , this was 1986 : @entity63 had just unveiled its first laptop , the @entity62 was launching the @entity65 and @entity66 kept daring us to fly ever higher in the hit film " @entity68 " . yet peer inside @entity16 today , and you 'll find a sagging , faded 1980s time warp . " it 's like stepping back in time , " @entity39 said of the boat which had notched up just 800 hours on the clock . " it still has all the @entity50 livery , original charts , electronics and seats . " " it 's amazing just looking out the window -- a bit like sitting in the front seat in @entity88 , " he added , referring to the 1982 tv series starring @entity82 and a sci - fi car . after smashing the record books , @entity50 is believed to have been sold to a @entity91 sultan , whose faded coat of arms still adorns the boat . in 2005 it was sold again to a secret owner who " kept it in the @entity99 but rarely used it , " said @entity39 . " the boat was towed into @entity101 where she started to degrade quite quickly . " work is now underway repairing the vessel which had been left languishing in a boatyard for the last eight years , with plans to test her on the open seas next month . @entity16 will have a new engine , fuel tank , electronic equipment and interior -- all in keeping with the original style . once complete , the legendary vessel will travel 2,400 kilometers to @entity39 ' boat building business , @entity116 in south west @entity117 , with plans to tour her across the country . the vessel had been advertised for $ 380,000 , though @entity39 declined to say how much he paid for it . " she could have very easily been set for the scrapyard , " he said . " many people had seen her , but i think a lot had been scared off by the amount of work needed . " @entity16 may have cemented her place in maritime history , but it was n't all smooth sailing for the record - breaking @entity13 crossing . @entity12 's first attempt at the @entity135 -- the award for the fastest crossing of the ocean -- ended in disaster in 1985 when @entity140 sunk off the south west coast of @entity117 . unfortunately for @entity12 , he was denied the @entity135 after breaking two rules of the competition - stopping to refuel and using a vessel which did not have a commercial maritime purpose . regardless , he was showered in champagne greeted by cheering crowds upon arrival in @entity22 -- despite the pouring rain . today , @entity16 may be a little worse for wear . but much like that other 1980s icon , film @entity152 , @entity39 may soon turn back the clock on the legendary power boat .	@entity22:Britain	@entity20:Spanish	@entity117:England	@entity116:Seahawks Workboats	@entity82:David Hasselhoff	@entity135:Blue Riband	@entity152:Back to the Future	@entity0:CNN	@entity88:Knight Rider	@entity50:Virgin Atlantic Challenger II	@entity57:Isle of Scilly	@entity56:New York	@entity55:Branson	@entity16:Challenger II	@entity13:Atlantic	@entity12:Richard Branson	@entity39:Stevens	@entity101:Palma	@entity99:Mediterranean	@entity91:Saudi Arabian	@entity162:Virgin Media	@entity140:Virgin Atlantic Challenger I	@entity68:Top Gun	@entity66:Tom Cruise	@entity65:Mir Space Station	@entity62:Soviet Union	@entity63:IBM
@entity23 left @entity28 to go fight alongside @placeholder	@entity6	@entity2 ( @entity3 ) @entity1 's voice wavers slightly as she recounts how her little boy became an @entity6 militant . every word seems tinged with anger and regret , but most of all , purpose . the process of radicalization is gradual and persuasive , she said . and deadly . her son , who joined @entity6 's ranks in @entity16 , was killed in fighting there more than a year ago . " it 's so easy for them to get to our children , to access our children , " she said . @entity1 's son , @entity23 , converted to @entity24 after a troubling period in high school in @entity27 , @entity28 . the mother remembers her son 's religion bringing him peace . she did n't suspect anything when @entity23 told her he was leaving for @entity34 to study @entity35 . in reality , the 22 - year - old was in @entity16 alongside @entity6 fighters . he was killed during fighting near @entity41 in january 2014 . ( @entity41 was considered @entity16 's most dangerous city at the time , with intense fighting between government forces , rebels , and @entity6 militants ) . how did her boy -- the one in photos kneeling by a christmas tree , or shirtless and raking leaves as a child , or sitting in a laundry basket as a toddler -- end up losing his life fighting for the creation of an @entity24 caliphate in the @entity58 ? @entity1 is now lending her support and voice to two organizations trying to combat radicalization . @entity63 and @entity64 are two new online resources for parents , teachers and communities to help counter extremist messages and recruitment . " the way a lot of it happens is one main recruiter plants the ideology in their mind and the @entity78 reinforces that with the information that they can search up and other contacts that they can make easily online , " @entity1 said . @entity28 have joined @entity6 to fight -- and die -- in @entity16 her message boils down to this , something reminiscent of anti-drug ads : talk to your kids about @entity6 before they do . " we need to start arming ourselves with the knowledge , the awareness , the education , and to be able to deal with these issues and be able to speak with our children at an early age , " @entity1 said . " we do the same thing with sex education , with drugs , and this is just one more thing that our kids are faced with , a challenge . " the lack of understanding and resources available to families like hers was devastating , she said . she was especially afraid for @entity23 's younger siblings . " we were living in a really desperate black hole of trauma and we did n't know how to heal from it , and i was terrified that the anger would burn within them and not being able to cope with this type of trauma and that they would follow the same path , " she said . while growing up in @entity27 , in @entity119 province , @entity1 remembers her son as a cuddly , warm and compassionate little boy . that changed in high school , when he experienced problems with peers and became withdrawn . he attempted suicide just after his 17th birthday , his mother said . after his recovery he converted to @entity24 . " i saw some positive changes start to happen . he became social again . the old @entity23 that i knew when he was younger , much younger , was starting to come out . he was socializing , he was peaceful , he was grounded , he was n't drinking , he was n't using drugs , there were lots of positive changes , " @entity1 said . but that changed when @entity23 moved out on his own , changed mosques and sought out more and more radical content online , his mother said . what @entity1 learned is while youths can become radicalized online , there is nothing to counter it or to provoke questions about what they are being told . " in fact , what 's out there is only something that can reinforce those ideas so we really need to start challenging the ideologies that are being placed in their minds , " @entity1 said . @entity28 security officials came to her door in 2013 , breaking the news that @entity23 was suspected of being a militant and was likely in @entity16 , not in @entity34 . the next time she spoke on the phone with @entity23 , she confronted her son and he admitted that he was in @entity16 . " he was compelled to go there to help save women and children to stop the torture , to stop @entity163 and that 's what drew him there and as he told me , ' i 'm finally doing something productive in my life , mum , ' " @entity1 said . she says her son was further brainwashed in @entity16 and the he eventually sided with @entity6 , believing they were the stronger group and he was more likely to survive fighting for them . @entity1 wishes the @entity28 government had the power then to do what it is doing now : confiscate passports of @entity28 suspected of communicating with terrorists . she wants the government to go even further , to detain and provide counseling and help to those being indoctrinated in extremism . there are families , she says , that are desperate as they see their children being drawn by jihadist propaganda . " the biggest problem we have is that parents -- a lot of the time -- want to be able to place the blame somewhere else , " she said . " we want think that our children are safe and it could never happen to us . it 's always going to happen to somebody else . that 's a big mistake we all make as parents .

@entity1 is a constitutional monarchy that borders @placeholder , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 is a constitutional monarchy situated in the heart of @entity4 . bordered by @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , the country has a population of roughly 67 million people . the capital , @entity13 , combines the modern skyscrapers of a bustling @entity4 metropolis with the ancient temples and monuments of previous @entity1 civilizations , dating back hundreds of years . @entity13 : a tale of two cities @entity21 is the country 's major religion , although according to the @entity24 there are also minority @entity25 and @entity28 communities . @entity1 has a diverse landscape with a jungle hinterland in the north and beaches to the south . @entity1 islands in the @entity35 and the @entity36 are home to some of the region 's most spectacular beauty spots . since the modern nation state 's founding in 1932 , @entity1 has been served by a constitutional monarchy and is the only country in @entity4 to avoid coming under @entity46 colonial rule . the current head of state is @entity48 , who has reigned since 1946 , making him the world 's oldest serving monarch . the @entity48 is viewed by most @entity51 as a symbol of stability and a unifying force in what has often been a politically divided country . the extent of this polarization is borne out by the fact that @entity1 has seen more than 18 attempts at military coups since the early 1930s . the county 's political climate has been turbulent in recent years punctuated with scenes of civil unrest and violence . in 2006 former prime minister , @entity67 -- a charismatic populist who drew the majority of his support from the urban working classes and rural poor -- was deposed and forced into exile in a bloodless coup . post-coup elections in 2007 were won by allies from @entity67 's party , however @entity1 's @entity73 ruled that the three main coalition partners were guilty of electoral fraud . this decision opened the door for the leader of the country 's main opposition party , @entity84 , to form a coalition government in late 2008 . @entity84 's @entity86 , which draws the majority of its support from @entity1 's middle and upper classes , found itself with a majority in parliament . a formal parliamentary vote appointed him as prime minister . large scale protests against @entity84 's government led by supporters of the political pressure group the @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , commonly known as " the red shirts " , lead to large scale protests in 2009 and 2010 . the demonstrations turned violent in may 2010 when the military intervened to confront thousands of protestors who had occupied parts of @entity13 , demanding the removal of prime minister @entity84 . more than 80 people died while hundreds more were wounded . the democratic elections in mid- 2011 saw @entity84 defeated at the polls and @entity111 -- sister of the deposed @entity67 -- elected as the country 's first female prime minister . in her first months in charge @entity111 has had to deal with a busy in - tray , including responding to some of the most severe monsoon floods to afflict the country in living memory . more than 300 people have died as a result of the floods and over 100,000 have been forced from their homes . deadly floods wreak havoc in @entity1 @entity111 has also had to remain attentive to an ongoing border dispute with @entity8 and a long standing terrorist threat from @entity28 @entity129 separatists based predominantly in the countries southernmost provinces . in spite of these threats and the country 's volatile political life , @entity1 has remained one of the strongest performing economies in @entity4 . @entity138 is the only nation in the region that has a larger annual output according to the @entity142 @entity141 . @entity1 operates a free enterprise economy and is generally pro-investment , according to data from the @entity145 . it is a major exporter of machinery and electronic components , agricultural commodities , and jewellery . combined , these industries account for over half of the country 's gdp . another major sector for @entity1 's economy is tourism . the country is home to five @entity160 . the @entity161 of @entity1 has stated that it expects to receive more than 19 million visitors in 2011 alone . given the extent of recent flooding however , with some internal analysts predicting that parts of @entity1 may remain under water until early 2012 , this figure may yet be revised downwards .	@entity21:Buddhism	@entity111:Yingluck	@entity24:Thailand National Statistics Office	@entity25:Christian	@entity28:Islamic	@entity98:United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship	@entity84:Vejjajiva	@entity138:Indonesia	@entity86:Democrat Party	@entity35:Indian Ocean	@entity1:Thailand	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Laos	@entity6:Myanmar	@entity4:Southeast Asian	@entity9:Malaysia	@entity8:Cambodia	@entity51:Thais	@entity73:Constitutional Court	@entity13:Bangkok	@entity36:Gulf of Thailand	@entity99:UFDD	@entity129:Malay	@entity145:CIA World Factbook	@entity160:UNESCO World Heritage sites	@entity161:Tourism Authority	@entity141:Chamber of Commerce	@entity142:U.S.	@entity46:European	@entity67:Thaksin Shinawatra	@entity48:King
@placeholder issued statement defending company but not directly addressing allegations	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a lawsuit filed in @entity3 against @entity4 on wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced @entity9 men to work against their will in @entity11 . the lawyer and relatives of men who were employed by @entity4 and allegedly sent to @entity11 without their consent . the men , between the ages of 18 and 27 , were recruited in @entity9 and told they would be doing work in hotel and restaurant kitchens in @entity21 , @entity22 , but were sent instead to @entity11 to work at a @entity24 air base , according to the lawsuit . the lawsuit alleges @entity4 , based in @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 , a @entity22 - based subcontractor , engineered the trafficking scheme . a @entity4 spokeswoman would not comment directly on the allegations but released a statement defending the company . " @entity4 has not yet seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time . the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains @entity4 's top priority . the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior , " @entity4 spokeswoman @entity42 said in a statement e-mailed to @entity1 . " each employee is expected to adhere to the company 's @entity48 and complete ethics training , which includes @entity51 ( trafficking in @entity52 ) information , " @entity42 continued . efforts by @entity1 to reach @entity55 were unsuccessful . when the @entity9 men arrived in @entity22 , according to the lawsuit , the contractors took their passports and drove them into @entity11 . @entity60 , a lawyer with @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , which filed the lawsuit , said about 70 @entity9 men were driven into @entity11 in a large convoy of civilian vehicles . one of the lead vehicles was ahead of the convoy and was stopped by insurgents posing as @entity70 . twelve of the @entity9 men were taken by the insurgents and later killed . " as the men were being transported to @entity11 , a car containing twelve of the men was stopped by members of the @entity77 , an insurgent group . the 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents , " according to a statement on the law firm 's web site . a 13th man , @entity84 , was not kidnapped and arrived at the @entity24 @entity86 air base in western @entity11 in august 2004 . @entity84 worked in a warehouse managed by @entity4 and was released 15 months later by the company , according to the law firm . @entity84 and the families of the 12 men who were killed have brought the lawsuit . @entity60 says the other @entity9 workers who were sent to @entity11 with @entity84 did not come forward for the lawsuit after they were eventually released from @entity4 . " their families went deep into debt to arrange the jobs , which they hoped would lift them out of poverty , " according to the lawsuit . the case garnered the attention of the @entity102 inspector general 's office after a number of news reports about @entity4 involvement in trafficking . the department concluded an investigation in april 2006 . " the primary finding concluded that the @entity110 had no jurisdiction over the persons , offenses , or circumstances that resulted in the @entity9 deaths , " according to the final report . the report also concluded that the events happened " before starting their employment with @entity4 . " however , the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the @entity24 military .	@entity22:Jordan	@entity21:Amman	@entity26:Texas	@entity27:Daoud & Partners	@entity24:U.S.	@entity25:Houston	@entity84:Gurung	@entity86:Al Asad	@entity110:U.S. Government	@entity3:California	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:WASHINGTON	@entity4:KBR	@entity9:Nepali	@entity52:Persons	@entity51:TIPS	@entity55:Daoud	@entity77:Ansar al-Sunna Army	@entity70:Iraqi Police	@entity11:Iraq	@entity102:Department of Defense	@entity62:Milstein	@entity42:Browne	@entity48:Code of Business Conduct	@entity63:Hausfeld & Toll	@entity60:Handley	@entity61:Cohen
two @placeholder diplomats are expelled from the @entity3	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- diplomatic tensions between the @entity3 and @entity4 showed no signs of slowing monday as the @entity6 announced that two @entity4 diplomats had been expelled . @entity9 and @entity10 were declared personae non gratae and ordered to leave the country in response to the @entity16 nation 's decision to kick out two @entity3 officials last week , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity8 told reporters . " around the world , when our people are thrown out unjustly , we 're going to take reciprocal action , " she said . " we need to do that to protect our own people . " the expulsion of the @entity4 diplomats comes after @entity4 officials -- just hours before announcing president @entity29 's death last week -- said they were expelling two @entity3 @entity31 officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country . " in the day or days that followed there was some pretty heated rhetoric coming in our direction , " @entity8 said monday . " i think i called it at one point a page from the old ' @entity42 ' playbook that we were hoping was going to change . ... there is work that we would like to do together , particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism , counternarcotics , economics and energy relations , but it 's going to take a change of tone from @entity54 . " the expelled @entity4 diplomats have left the @entity3 , @entity8 said . @entity56 worked in the @entity57 in @entity58 , and @entity59 worked at the @entity60 in @entity0 , she said . the expelled @entity3 officials , both air attaches at the @entity31 in @entity54 , were accused of having meetings with members of the @entity4 military and encouraging them to pursue " destabilizing projects , " @entity4 foreign minister @entity61 said . " we will not allow any foreign interference in our country , " @entity61 said last week . @entity71 , then vice president and now @entity4 's interim leader , also suggested as he criticized the @entity3 @entity31 officials last week that someone had deliberately infected @entity29 with cancer . @entity6 spokesman @entity77 denied the accusations . " this fallacious assertion of inappropriate @entity3 action leads us to conclude that , unfortunately , the current @entity4 government is not interested an improved relationship , " he said . it is n't the first time that diplomatic tensions have surged between the two countries . last year the @entity6 declared @entity4 's consul general in @entity89 persona non grata -- @entity91 for unwelcome or unacceptable person -- and expelled her from the @entity3 . in 2008 , @entity4 expelled the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity16 country . a day later , the @entity3 said it was expelling the @entity4 ambassador . @entity71 enters @entity4 presidency race @entity1 en @entity99 ¬± ol 's @entity97 reported from @entity0 @entity1 's @entity100 reported from @entity101 . @entity1 's @entity102 contributed to this report .	@entity29:Chavez	@entity89:Miami	@entity3:U.S.	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:State Department	@entity4:Venezuela	@entity9:Orlando Jose Montanez Olivares	@entity8:Nuland	@entity57:Venezuelan Consulate	@entity56:Camacaro	@entity54:Caracas	@entity77:Patrick Ventrell	@entity58:New York	@entity71:Maduro	@entity31:Embassy	@entity16:South American	@entity10:Victor Camacaro Mata	@entity100:Catherine E.

@placeholder received the @entity204 in @entity205	@entity24	( @entity0 ) -- as co-chairman of @entity3 , @entity1 is one of an elite club : a female movie mogul in @entity6 . and holding one of the most sought - after jobs in the industry comes with responsibility , in @entity12 's eyes . part of her role , she says , is mentoring the next generation of young women who 've set their sights on working in the movies -- helping them to set realistic expectations in an industry built on bringing fantasies to life . that way , they " do n't waste a lot of time on ... dreaming about doing something that is not realistic or does n't exist , " said @entity24 , adding that she directs them " toward some of the real opportunities that are actually there in the business . " @entity24 joined @entity3 in 2001 as senior vice president of production , then became president of production where she oversaw hits including " it 's complicated " and " @entity39 . " in 2009 she was promoted to co-chairman and now works with chairman @entity42 on the studio 's business and production strategies . a large part of her job is " running a business " and mitigating problems such as the decline of the dvd market in the face of @entity53 and video on demand . the brains behind the most viral ad ever but what really fills her with passion is the creative part of the job . " i just love being at the heart of the creative process . you know being somebody who facilitates a creative vision and a dream and creating movies , stories for people all around the world , " she said . here she talks to @entity0 's leading women about being adopted , holding down her demanding job as a mother of two , and what it 's really like in @entity6 . on self - belief ... i am the only one in my family who is adopted . it always made me feel really special . i felt like i was chosen . i think it made me have a sense of sort of being able to deal with any situation . i think dealing with something like that at a very young age and having an understanding that those kinds of things happen in the world made me ... believe in myself and believe that anything is possible . on rising through the ranks in a male - dominated business ... i think women have a unique way of multi-tasking and being sort of the ultimate diplomats and those are two skills that come in really handy in our business . we are dealing with different situations and artistic and creative people ... who need some real @entity110 sometimes . it does n't ( feel like a man 's world ) to me . i think it 's because i am surrounded by great and fabulous women . you are never going to get validation , the amount of validation that you sometimes need from other people . and even though you may get it , you ca n't rely upon it . you have to have that inner strength . on putting off a family until after 40 ... i think i am a better mother having done it a little bit later in life and having got to a point where my career was really on solid footing . how @entity132 scouts clowns , trapeze artists and gymnasts on juggling work and family life ... i had to figure out how to leave my work at work . i realized that all of the experience that i had and all of the expertise that i brought to the table every day gave me a certain confidence to just kind of let go and not sweat the small stuff and really just ... be able to look at the big picture and manage . it is difficult . i think as women we carry a huge amount of guilt every second of every day we are not with our children . i hope ultimately that they would have pride in the fact that they have a mother who loves what she does and goes to work every day happy . but ... it does it requires a huge amount of organization and prioritization . and you know i am very fortunate that i have an incredibly supportive husband . on commercial movies ... i think that there is ... a conception out there that those films -- because they are so commercial and because they are required to be commercial -- ca n't be creative . but i actually disagree with that . their reach is really worldwide . the ... visual effects component of those films is exciting to moviegoers all over the world . so , that 's definitely a kind of movie making that is absolutely imperative to the studios . on @entity6 ... there is a superficial side to it ... we are all creating a fantasy after all , every day . that is what we do . but the people behind the scenes , they are people who are going to work every day ... these are all people who are so passionate about what they are doing .	@entity3:Universal	@entity1:Donna Langley	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Hollywood	@entity24:Langley	@entity39:Mamma Mia	@entity53:Netflix	@entity42:Adam Fogelson	@entity110:TLC	@entity12:Langley	@entity132:Cirque du Soleil	@entity205:Film	@entity204:2010 Crystal Award for Excellence
@entity9 will be available on @entity52 , @entity253 and @placeholder	@entity252	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's new flagship smartphone , @entity3 , is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways . @entity9 is a top - notch , beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features . it also runs a unique , fresh take on @entity18 's @entity17 operating system . and it 's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major @entity22 carriers . this is the phone that could close the gap between @entity2 's flagship and those from @entity28 and @entity29 . we spent a couple of hours with the one before its big unveiling in @entity34 today , and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset , the expert build quality holding it all together , and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features . although the phone carries the branding established last year with the one x , one s , and other @entity2 phones , the one amounts to a reboot of the company 's vision for @entity17 . the one x , @entity2 's previous flagship , won critical praise , but as an @entity52 exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for . " we think about the one x and we think ' wow , it was big , and it was one of the best phones we 've ever done , ' " @entity55 , @entity2 's vice president of design , said . " but if i were to compare it to , say , other stuff that was out there , i would n't say it was a step - change different . " the company set out to build a phone that could surpass , not just meet , the performance and quality of the @entity68 and @entity69 . so it put a huge effort into nailing the @entity73 user interface , packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers . sense 4 , the previous generation of @entity2 's @entity17 customization , has been thrown out . every aspect of @entity73 has been rethought and redesigned . the result is a slick , clean user interface , full of artful icons that match the flat , understated look @entity18 has been trying to push with its own stock version of @entity17 . and there 's a focus in the new sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive ‚Äî such as sifting through social media and news apps , or snapping photos and video . " i think we came to this recognition that , ' wow , there are these two other companies that are going to spend a lot more money than @entity2 , ' " @entity55 said . " this is the reality of the business . they have much deeper pockets and they can carpet bomb the industry and they have a tremendous amount of inertia there , particularly with @entity28 in the @entity111 , for the one , we really had to get it right , we really had to just go for it . " while it 's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the one and think of the @entity68 , the one is far from a copycat product . it has a massive ‚Äî and gorgeous ‚Äî 4.7 - inch 1080p display with a pixel density of 468 pixels per inch . as with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays , pixels are indiscernible on the @entity117 's generous display . colors look vivid and crisp as well . the touchscreen dominates the front of @entity3 , with aluminum capping each end . rows of pinholes are machined into each strip of aluminum , serving as pathways for sound coming from a set of dual front - facing speakers . every phone speaker we 've ever heard has sounded like hell . while the one wo n't replace your @entity145 anytime soon , its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we 've heard from a phone . inside , the one features a @entity151 , quad - core @entity149 , @entity152 of @entity153 , and @entity155 chip , @entity156 and connectivity to both @entity158 and lte networks . everything is packed into a sleek , aluminum unibody ‚Äî shipping in either silver or black ‚Äî that features a subtly curved back with inlaid antennas . @entity9 weighs 5.04 ounces , and is just 0.36 inches thick . @entity9 will also sports a beefed up camera , with a ton of photo and video features ‚Äî which are so plentiful we 've written a separate story focusing on the @entity117 's camera . along with all new hardware , @entity2 is using the one to introduce an all new take on @entity17 . sense 4 , @entity2 's last skin , was among the best versions of @entity18 's mobile os thanks to its simplicity and gimmick - free implementation . the latest version ‚Äî now just called @entity73 ‚Äî brings users from a lock screen to a new @entity183 - like app called @entity184 , which displays a feed of information , stories , photos and video from various sources of your choosing . @entity2 has worked in integration with a few news outlets , so news stories by topic or by outlet can show up in your @entity184 . and the app can be connected to @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and other social networks as well . see a news story you 're interested in reading ? just tap the tile in your feed and you 're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy ‚Äî again , very much like @entity183 , @entity213 , @entity214 and other " read it later " services . tap a tweet or post from @entity201 you 'll be launched into that corresponding social network 's @entity17 app. you can even set up @entity184 to pipe in your photos and videos . everything is displayed in reverse chronological order , just like your @entity200 timeline , @entity201 feed and everything else that 's sorted online . while @entity184 is a pre-installed app , it 's also the default view any one user will see once they unlock their phone . if you want to get to a traditional @entity17 homescreen view ‚Äî with apps , widgets and folders of apps ‚Äî just swipe in from the right on @entity184 and @entity17 as you know it will appear . " if you want regular @entity17 , it 's there , " @entity55 said . " but , everybody 's snacking on information , whether it 's from their social networks or some news source that they 're just interested in . so [ @entity184 ] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones . " @entity52 , @entity252 and @entity253 will sell @entity3 , along with many smaller regional telecom companies . the significance of this ca n't be overstated . currently , only @entity28 's @entity68 and @entity29 's @entity69 are offered as widely . the @entity68 is sold through @entity52 , @entity252 and @entity257 ‚Äî and it 's on it 's way to @entity253 . the @entity69 is sold by all four of the nation 's top carriers . all too often , a great phone , like last year 's one x , was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones . the fact that the one is joining it 's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for @entity2 ‚Äî because they get to sell their best device in more places ‚Äî and consumers ‚Äî because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone . subscribe to @entity280 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity284 .	@entity22:U.S.	@entity28:Apple	@entity29:Samsung	@entity117:One	@entity252:Sprint	@entity158:HSPA	@entity253:T-Mobile	@entity111:U.S. So	@entity257:Verizion	@entity153:RAM	@entity152:2GB	@entity151:1.7GHz	@entity156:Bluetooth 4.0	@entity155:NFC	@entity3:the One	@entity2:HTC	@entity0:CNN	@entity213:Pocket	@entity9:The One	@entity52:AT&T	@entity55:Croyle	@entity295:UltraPixels	@entity73:Sense	@entity17:Android	@entity214:Pulse	@entity34:New York	@entity69:S III	@entity18:Google	@entity202:Flickr	@entity201:Facebook	@entity200:Twitter	@entity145:Jambox	@entity183:Flipboard	@entity184:BlinkFeed	@entity149:Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU	@entity280:WIRED magazine	@entity68:iPhone	@entity284:Wired.com
@entity1 head : @entity3 will continue to work with 3 @placeholder nations on " push " factors	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 this week announced it is opening the largest immigrant family detention facility in the @entity3 , amid concerns from immigrant - rights groups . the center in @entity7 , @entity8 , was opened on monday to house the surge of " family units , " or women and children who say they fled extreme violence in their native @entity15 countries to seek asylum in the @entity3 . the privately contracted facility sits on 51 acres and will have 2,400 beds at a cost of $ 260 million per year to taxpayers , according to local reports . " the regional refugee crisis in @entity15 demands a humanitarian response by the @entity3 , not a show of force , " a coalition of immigrant - rights groups said this week in an open letter to president @entity25 . " these mothers have faced unimaginable suffering and danger and have come to the @entity3 seeking protection , often with close relatives in the @entity3 who are willing and able to provide for them . they are not evading law enforcement ; they are seeking out @entity37 officers , " the letter added . 5 immigration myths debunked in a statement at the opening of the detention center , @entity1 secretary @entity39 said the facility promotes and highlights " the border security aspects of the executive actions president @entity25 announced on nov. 20 . " " we will continue to work with the governments of @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 to address with them the conditions in those three countries that are the ' push ' factors for illegal migration from there to here , and to repatriate those of their citizens who came here illegally . " @entity39 added . @entity39 said the @entity25 administration also intends to go forward with an " in - country refugee program " in the three countries , a program announced last month by vice president @entity66 . the program will " allow parents who are lawfully present in the @entity3 to request access to the @entity69 for their children still in those three countries , " @entity39 said . @entity1 : more @entity15 apprehended than @entity71 there are at least three other family detention centers in use by the federal government to house detained immigrant families , including centers in @entity78 , @entity8 , and @entity79 , @entity80 . a facility in @entity82 , @entity83 , is expected to close in the coming weeks , and hundreds of immigrants staying there will get preference for relocating to the @entity7 facility . funding for the centers will expire in late february 2015 if @entity89 fails to act on a @entity1 request for supplemental funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 , @entity39 said . immigrant - rights groups have been vocal in their opposition to the centers , which sprouted this summer as a result of the unprecedented influx of undocumented immigrants from @entity15 . beyond the border : getting there and then what ? earlier this year , the @entity100 claimed guards working at the @entity78 facility requesting sexual favors in return for money .

faulty support plates led to @placeholder bridge collapse , according to @entity18	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the august 1 , 2007 , bridge collapse in @entity7 that killed 13 people and injured 145 . thirteen people were killed and 145 were injured in the august 1 , 2007 , @entity7 bridge collapse . the gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the @entity14 over the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity7 , causing the collapse , according to the @entity18 . there were 111 vehicles on the portion of the bridge that collapsed , dropping them 108 feet into the 15 - foot - deep river . an @entity18 report released friday said the board 's investigation found that 24 " under - designed " gusset plates were not discovered in reviews during the bridge 's design and construction . the bridge opened in 1967 . substantial increases in the weight of the bridge because of modifications through the years , along with increased weight on the bridge due to construction equipment and rush - hour traffic the day of the collapse , likely contributed to the faulty plates ' collapse , the board said . the board 's investigation determined that other possible reasons for the collapse , including corrosion found on the plates and preexisting cracks in the bridge , did not play a role in the collapse . " we believe this thorough investigation should put to rest any speculation as to the root cause of this terrible accident and provide a roadmap for improvements to prevent future tragedies , " said @entity18 acting chairman @entity53 . see diagram of bridge ¬ª several victims of the crash have filed lawsuits against a consulting firm that evaluated the bridge and the construction company whose equipment was on the bridge the day of the collapse . as a result of its investigation , the safety board made nine recommendations to the @entity76 and the @entity77 dealing with improving how bridges are inspected and how bridge designs are reviewed .	@entity16:Minneapolis	@entity15:Mississippi River	@entity14:I-35W bridge	@entity7:Minnesota	@entity18:NTSB	@entity53:Mark V.

@placeholder wore a shirt featuring women dressed in lingerie	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- while the world watched the historic landing of a space probe on a comet 310 million miles from @entity5 , many were distracted by what was happening closer to home . @entity9 scientist @entity8 caused a firestorm with his choice of fashion during the @entity14 's live stream of wednesday 's @entity16 landing . @entity8 initially sported a shirt featuring women in lingerie , possibly not the wisest choice of attire given all of the discussion surrounding the challenges for women in the tech and science fields . " the fact that a scientist of any gender , but especially a man , would think it 's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling ; and clearly , he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from @entity42 , " @entity27 wrote in an article on @entity29 . @entity42 is the acronym for science , technology , engineering and mathematics , and women in those disciplines have long complained of sexism and other difficulties in their male - dominated fields . the shirt quickly spawned its own hashtag on @entity55 -- # shirtstorm -- as both sexes took @entity8 to task . " no no women are toooootally welcome in our community , just ask the dude in this shirt , " tweeted the @entity60 tech writer @entity59 . " i do n't care what scientists wear . but a shirt featuring women in lingerie is n't appropriate for a broadcast if you care about women in @entity42 , " tweeted astrophysicist @entity68 . " you think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome ? i do n't , " @entity79 added when another @entity55 user questioned whether she was going too far . @entity27 wrote that the shirt was sexist and that " the people who were upset by it were n't just those silly oversensitive feminists who ca n't take a joke . scientists from all perspectives were unimpressed with the shirt , both on professional grounds and gendered ones . " @entity8 has been one of the most public faces of the mission and is known as an unconventional scientist . he sports tattoos all over his arms and , in honor of the @entity9 mission , got some new ink in january : a drawing of the space probe landing on the comet . during a recent @entity103 , @entity8 was asked about whether tattooed men can achieve greatness and said , " the people i work with do n't judge me by my looks but only by the work i have done and can do . simple . " @entity8 reportedly changed out of the shirt during the live stream . on friday , he made an emotional apology during another live stream about the mission . " the shirt i wore this week , i made a big mistake , and i 've offended many people , and i am very sorry about this , " @entity8 said before wiping his eyes . we can land on a comet , but we ca n't ...	@entity16:Philae	@entity0:CNN	@entity27:Smith	@entity5:Earth	@entity9:Rosetta	@entity8:Taylor	@entity42:STEM	@entity103:Wall Street Journal Facebook Q&A	@entity79:Mack	@entity68:Katie Mack	@entity29:XOJane	@entity14:European Space Agency	@entity59:Rose Eveleth	@entity60:Atlantic	@entity55:Twitter

@placeholder 's nuclear facilities have also come under attack from cyber attacks	@entity7	a report expected this week from the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has @entity2 abuzz with talk of the potential for a pre-emptive strike on @entity7 's nuclear facilities . @entity9 diplomats have told @entity10 that the report says @entity7 has mastered the critical steps necessary to design and build a nuclear weapon . missiles are not , of course , the only way to launch an attack . @entity7 's nuclear facilities are under siege from cyber attacks . and one , the @entity23 virus , was able to penetrate @entity7 's @entity25 nuclear facility , researchers say . how did it work ? @entity23 was stealthy . the @entity25 computer network is a closed system , separated from any other network or internet access . so , @entity23 infected a third party first , likely a trusted contractor to the @entity25 facility . that contractor may then have unknowingly passed on the virus by plugging in an infected removable drive into the computers inside the @entity25 facility . more importantly , @entity23 was smart . it knew exactly what it was looking for : a specific software called @entity39 used specifically to run the @entity41 controllers operating at @entity25 . @entity23 spread through the network undetected . if it did n't find the step 7 software , it left things alone . but once it found its target , @entity23 set to work . first , it effectively hijacked the @entity25 control system , speeding up or slowing down the centrifuges , wearing them out prematurely . as the centrifuges destroyed themselves , @entity23 sent back signals that everything was fine and running smoothly . so , the operators may not have known this was happening until it was too late . so , just how effective was @entity23 ? according to the @entity54 , @entity1 records show that between the end of 2009 and early 2010 about 1,000 centrifuges at @entity25 had to be replaced . @entity23 is the suspected culprit . still , that 's only about one out of every nine centrifuges and , despite a minor dip in production , uranium enrichment continued apace . who created @entity23 is still a mystery . many computer security researchers believe the virus is so complex and sophisticated that it would have needed the resources of a nation state -- or a combination of states -- to produce it . researchers at internet security firm @entity72 say they have identified a new virus called @entity74 that they believe is a successor to @entity23 , although not all security experts agree . " this is not a copycat , " insists @entity77 of @entity72 . " whoever created this had access to the same source code as @entity23 . " @entity77 says @entity74 is , at this stage , a malware designed simply to spy and collect information from @entity7 's computer systems , but she suspects it may be ultimately intended for sabotage . " it could be that @entity23 did n't entirely achieve what was wanted the first time around , " @entity77 told @entity10 . @entity74 was released as late as august 2010 , just after the @entity23 virus had done its damage , stunning many researchers who had not expected to see another virus of the same complexity released so quickly . @entity97 , the @entity98 computer security specialist credited with discovering @entity23 , says it does n't matter who created @entity74 . the problem , he says , is that @entity23 , in its bid to stop nuclear proliferation , may have sparked its own arms race . " the first cyberwar weapon is comparable to the first nuclear weapon , " he wrote in a blog post recently . " to build the first nuclear bomb , it took a genius like @entity110 and the resources of the @entity113 project . to copy the design , it requires just a bunch of engineers -- no genius needed .	@entity2:Israel	@entity1:IAEA	@entity7:Iran	@entity23:Stuxnet	@entity39:Step 7	@entity9:Western	@entity25:Natanz	@entity110:Oppenheimer	@entity10:CNN	@entity113:Manhattan	@entity41:Siemens	@entity98:German	@entity97:Ralph Langner	@entity74:Duqu	@entity77:Cox	@entity54:Institute for Science and International Security	@entity72:Symantec
" @entity20 so far have placed their strategic alliance with @placeholder , " @entity8 legislator said before veto	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- as the @entity2 was preparing friday to debate a resolution branding @entity5 settlement activity in the @entity6 as illegal , @entity8 officials called @entity10 administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that @entity14 policy is " biased " and " seriously wrong . " " this is a moment of truth because very clearly the @entity20 so far have placed their strategic alliance with @entity5 and the legal cover for @entity5 violations above their own interests , " said veteran @entity8 legislator and @entity17 executive committee member @entity15 . " the @entity20 have very clearly demonstrated to @entity8 , to @entity26 public opinion , and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction , " @entity15 told @entity1 , echoing an argument made by many @entity8 officials . the resolution being brought to the @entity33 by the @entity8 and other @entity26 states presents a political dilemma for the @entity36 as it tries to navigate policy in a quickly evolving @entity39 region . the @entity10 administration has been critical of @entity5 settlement construction in the past , but has not gone as far as to call it " illegal " and anything short of an @entity14 veto of the resolution is bound to deepen tensions with @entity5 and stir up considerable congressional opposition . on friday , the @entity20 vetoed friday the resolution . the @entity20 ambassador to the @entity2 , @entity49 , said the @entity20 agrees about " the folly " of continued @entity5 settlement activity , but " we think it unwise for this council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide " @entity5 and @entity8 . @entity10 's first @entity2 veto the previous day , @entity36 spokesman @entity57 said the @entity20 does " not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity " and that it is " corrosive not only to peace efforts and a two - state solution , but to @entity5 's future itself . " president @entity10 on thursday called @entity65 president @entity64 to discuss the resolution and speak about alternatives to a @entity33 vote . among the options that have been floated , @entity14 and @entity8 officials said , was a @entity33 presidential statement which is weaker than an actual resolution . other ideas included stronger future statements from the international peace group known as the quartet , and the possibility of a @entity33 fact finding mission to the region . after the call , @entity64 called an emergency friday meeting of the @entity17 executive committee to discuss the issue but early indications suggest that the @entity8 will not agree to shelf the resolution . " if they keep trying to manipulate and water down a resolution to become a statement , and they start selling us used goods again it 's not going to work , " @entity15 said . " the legitimacy and strength of any leadership comes from the people not from @entity14 approval or disapproval and the @entity20 since the breakdown of @entity14 - brokered talks with @entity5 in september over the issue of settlements , the @entity65 has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a @entity8 state by september based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of @entity14 countries . both @entity20 and @entity5 oppose the unilateral efforts insisting that all issues in the conflict must be dealt with through direct negotiations . @entity114 , a senior official in @entity64 ' @entity116 party , said @entity8 were determined to press ahead with the resolution and said the administration needed to adapt to changing regional circumstances . " obviously the @entity20 has to weigh its options , now amidst all the revolutions that are made and engineered by the people i think the voice of sense should prevail . ... unless the international community pressures @entity5 to abide by its will by the will of the international community , it will be hard to see how the entire @entity39 could come to a rest .

protests held at @placeholder stores across country	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- a mother who says she was harassed and humiliated by employees while breastfeeding her baby at a @entity5 store in @entity6 last month prompted a nationwide " nurse - in " on wednesday to show support for the public practice . @entity10 , 35 , says she was nursing her 5 - month - old infant at a @entity5 when several employees asked her to move to the fitting room . @entity6 law allows for breastfeeding in private or public , but @entity10 says the employees continued to direct her to the dressing room even after she mentioned her rights .

" we continually educate our team members in stores across the country on store policies to ensure all guests have a great experience . we worked with this guest directly to address her concerns and are sorry any inconvenience it has caused , " @entity31 said . in a show of solidarity with @entity10 , women from @entity54 to @entity55 to @entity56 held " nurse - ins " at @entity5 stores . in @entity64 , @entity55 , more than a dozen women sat comfortably on the ground with their legs crossed while nursing their babies , most of whom were covered by wraps or blankets . similar scenes played out at @entity5 stores in @entity70 , @entity56 ; @entity71 , @entity54 ; and @entity72 .

" this does not ease our loss , but we must and we will continue to relentlessly pursue the enemy , " @entity20 told @entity25 reporters assembled for a video news conference wednesday . the strike took place in @entity34 district , @entity36 province , on monday , the @entity21 said . a @entity5 spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment . @entity36 provincial spokesman @entity39 also could not be reached for comment . the attack on the helicopter saturday represented the worst single - incident loss of @entity9 life since the start of the @entity1 war . thirty @entity9 died in the crash , military officials said . the other victims were @entity1 personnel . the @entity25 will put the @entity51 death toll in the helicopter downing at 17 , according to two @entity25 officials . originally , @entity25 sources told the news media that 22 seals were killed . @entity14 was a key facilitator in an insurgent attack cell led by @entity59 , a @entity5 leader killed in a previous @entity61 mission , @entity20 said . @entity14 had as many as 12 @entity5 fighters under his command , including potential suicide bombers . " after an exhaustive manhunt , special operations forces located @entity14 and the shooter after receiving multiple intelligence leads and tips from local citizens , " the @entity21 statement said . " the two men were attempting to flee the country in order to avoid capture . " @entity21 troops found and followed the two into a wooded area and , after ensuring no civilians were around , called for the airstrike , the statement said . @entity20 said the aircraft involved in the strike announced by @entity12 was the @entity83 , but he did n't say how many . @entity20 said the strike did n't kill the @entity5 leader that @entity9 forces were hunting the night of the fatal attack , but he confirmed that @entity14 was killed in the f - 16 strike announced wednesday . the remains of all 38 of those killed in saturday 's incident arrived at @entity92 in @entity93 on tuesday for a " dignified transfer . " because the catastrophic nature of the crash made the remains difficult to identify , all were brought to the @entity9 . the @entity99 explained that a " dignified transfer " is not a ceremony , but rather " the process by which , upon the return from the theater of operations to the @entity9 , the remains of fallen military members are transferred from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle and then to the port mortuary .

an @entity11 has been issued for @entity12 , 4 , of @entity16 , @placeholder	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- police and the mother of a 4 - year - old @entity4 boy clung to hope thursday for the child 's safety , days after a man allegedly snatched the pre-schooler from his grandmother 's arms then took off . an @entity11 was issued for @entity12 , who authorities say was abducted by @entity14 in the northern @entity4 town of @entity16 . " he ( @entity14 ) wanted to be with my son , " @entity17 told reporters thursday , adding that she had broken up with @entity14 four or five months ago . " he wanted to be with my son so bad that he took it to the extreme . " yet authorities feared the worst , after a witness reported seeing a car matching that of the alleged kidnapper plunge into the @entity26 . but they were not able to locate the vehicle during searches thursday . " we believe the suspect drove the car into the canal , with little @entity12 inside , " @entity31 sheriff @entity30 told @entity33 's @entity32 . " but so far , we have n't been able to locate the car . " @entity30 said that the search will resume friday , with help from the neighboring @entity40 sheriff 's department , using side - scanning sonar . the sheriff , though , also held out hope that the witness may have been mistaken -- and @entity12 , in fact , never went underwater . " there 's still hope that we 're going to be able to find @entity12 alive , " he said . in an emotional press conference thursday , the boy 's mother said she believes @entity14 is troubled -- claiming he told her that he sometimes " hears voices " and that he had been abusive when they were dating -- but she did not think he would drown her son or consciously put him in danger . @entity14 is not the boy 's biological father . " he 's scared , @entity14 's scared -- i know he is , " said @entity12 . " he probably does n't know what to do . " the suspect had come to @entity12 ' house early tuesday morning , according to the boy 's mother , leaving after she told him to leave because @entity12 was asleep and had a cold . the boy 's school later called @entity17 after @entity14 had gone there asking to spend time with the boy . in the late afternoon , @entity12 got a call from her frantic mother , who claimed that the @entity14 had again come by and , despite her struggle , had taken the boy from the grandmother 's arms . @entity12 said that her mother told her that the suspect then flashed an obscene gesture , laughed and got into his 2003 silver @entity75 , which he had left running . the boy , @entity12 , is 3 feet , 6 inches tall , weighs 40 pounds and has brown eyes and black hair , according to the @entity11 . he was wearing dark pants and a light blue shirt at the time of his abduction . @entity14 , 27 , is described in the same alert as being a @entity86 male , about 180 pounds and 5 feet , 9 inches tall . @entity17 , who broke down several times while addressing reporters , said she especially was worried that her son was not getting enough water or food . she issued an urgent plea to @entity14 , who she said took their break - up hard but stayed in contact , to drop off her son at a hospital or fire department . " please , i need him home , " she said . " i know he 's telling you that he 's missing me . you need to bring him home .

@entity9 says he has no regrets over killing dr. @placeholder at church in may 2009	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- a man on trial for gunning down a @entity4 abortion provider in church said he had no regrets because " abortion is murder . " @entity9 , 51 , said he shot and killed dr. @entity10 as services began on may 31 to save the lives of the unborn . " there was nothing being done and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " @entity9 said . " i did what i thought was needed to be done to protect the children . " @entity9 is charged with one count of first - degree murder for the death of @entity10 , who ran a women 's clinic in @entity24 where abortions were performed , including the controversial late - term procedure . @entity9 was the only witness for the defense , which rested its case thursday . @entity31 district judge @entity30 told jurors closing arguments will be held friday morning , depending on the weather . after the jury left , @entity30 ruled that the jury could not consider convicting @entity9 of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter , which is defined as " an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force " under @entity4 statute . @entity30 said testimony did not support the defense claim that @entity9 's beliefs on abortion justified the use of deadly force against @entity10 . @entity10 , 67 , was one of the few @entity49 doctors who performed late - term abortions . he had already survived one attempt on his life and a clinic bombing before he was slain . during @entity9 's testimony thursday , @entity10 's widow , @entity55 , and other family members sat in the gallery . initially stoic , they began to dab at tears as @entity9 described putting a gun to @entity10 's head . asked if he regretted what he did , @entity9 said , " no , i do n't . " upon learning that @entity10 's clinic was shut down after his death , he said he felt " a sense of relief . " dressed in a dark suit , white shirt and a red patterned tie , @entity9 calmly testified that he had a long - standing belief that @entity10 should die . he thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into him , perhaps , or shooting him with a rifle . his main concern , @entity9 said , was that he might harm others . under cross-examination by @entity31 district attorney @entity79 , he said he also considered cutting @entity10 's hands off with a sword , but decided that would not be effective , as @entity10 would still be able to train others . @entity9 said that through the anti-abortion group @entity84 he learned that @entity10 took measures to protect himself -- traveling in an armored car , using a security escort , wearing a bulletproof vest and living in a gated community . he decided to kill @entity10 at his church , he said , because " i felt that actually if he was to be stopped , that was probably the only place he could have been stopped . ... it was the only window of opportunity i saw . " @entity9 said he visited the church four or five times before @entity10 's death . the week before the shooting , on may 24 , he carried a .22 - caliber handgun with him , he testified , but @entity10 did not attend church that day . on may 31 , though , the doctor was greeting congregants in the foyer of @entity103 before @entity9 walked up to him and shot him at point blank range . " the lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop @entity10 , " @entity9 said . " i shot him . " under questioning from @entity79 , @entity9 acknowledged that he " somewhat " admired those who previously had committed violence against abortion providers . he said his anti-abortion beliefs " go hand in hand " with his religious beliefs . he said he became born again in 1992 after watching an episode of " the @entity116 . " asked if there are any circumstances in which he believes abortion is acceptable , @entity9 said he thought it could be if the mother 's life was in " absolute " danger . " i struggle with that decision , " he said , " because i believe that ultimately , it is up to our heavenly father . but if there was a time , that would be it . " he said he did not believe abortion was justified in the case of rape . " you are taking the life of the innocent . you 're punishing the innocent life for the sin of the father . two wrongs do n't make a right . " asked about incest , he said his beliefs were the same : " it is n't our duty to take life , it 's our heavenly father 's . " @entity9 's testimony was peppered with objections from prosecutors . many objections were sustained by @entity30 , who has maintained he does not want the trial to become a forum on abortion . in a conference out of the presence of jurors , @entity30 cautioned @entity9 , saying specifics on medical procedures would not be allowed . @entity9 's testimony would proceed , @entity30 said , " on a question - by - question basis . " @entity9 recounted conducting what he called " sidewalk counseling " at @entity164 abortion clinics , handing pamphlets and other literature to women as they went inside . " some of them did ultimately change their mind , " he said . in opening statements thursday , defense attorney @entity171 told jurors @entity9 " killed dr. @entity10 because he believed that was the only way , necessary to save the lives of the unborn . " defense attorneys claim @entity9 was also motivated by authorities ' failure to punish him through the judicial system . @entity30 refused to allow former @entity4 attorney general @entity182 to testify on behalf of the defense . on wednesday , he refused to allow testimony from current deputy attorney general @entity185 . @entity182 unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute @entity10 in 2006 . @entity185 charged @entity10 with 19 misdemeanor counts , but a jury acquitted the doctor . @entity30 said @entity9 can testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs , but to allow testimony from @entity182 would " get into legal matters that do not concern this jury . " and , the judge said , the cases do not give @entity9 a basis to state absolutely that @entity10 's actions were illegal , since the doctor had never been convicted . @entity9 testified he was " very frustrated " by @entity10 's acquittal , saying it " seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of @entity4 to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in @entity10 's clinic . " @entity210 , founder of @entity84 , told reporters outside the courtroom the trial is " a railroad , a kangaroo court , where they are denying critical evidence about what was on @entity9 's mind when he pulled the trigger . " " perhaps if the @entity31 prosecutors had done a better job prosecuting @entity10 for how he illegally killed babies , he would still be alive , " @entity210 said .	@entity31:Sedgwick County	@entity30:Wilbert	@entity0:CNN	@entity210:Terry	@entity164:Kansas City	@entity24:Wichita	@entity10:Tiller	@entity9:Roeder	@entity4:Kansas	@entity185:Disney	@entity49:U.S.	@entity116:700 Club	@entity103:Reformation Lutheran Church	@entity79:Foulston	@entity55:Jeanne	@entity171:Steve Osburn	@entity84:Operation Rescue	@entity182:Kline

" @entity18 has three fundamental problems . the first is that he does n't have a plan . tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs each week , and it is going to get worse and worse . @entity1 faces a huge public spending crisis - in health , pensions , and now welfare , and a government debt of 90 % of gdp . not one single adequate measure has been put forward , nor even proposed in his eight months in office . read more : what @entity18 's victory means for @entity57 's economy the second problem is that he lacks the political will to break the log - jams in @entity1 society : making industry more competitive , reducing government spending . he can not do these things because one of the constituencies he needs to take on -- the huge public sector -- is made up of the people who voted him into power . he could take on the equally irresponsible banks -- they did n't vote for him -- but he risks sending the economy into a tailspin if he does . and not only does he need to address the structural issues in @entity1 's economy and society , but he made the mistake of telling everyone he could solve the country 's problems painlessly , or by taxing the super-rich , and he is not managing to do that either , so he is just taxing everyone else . read more : @entity82 ois @entity18 : left turn for @entity1 ? now he faces the worst situation possible because no one believes a word he says . he delivered a robust @entity88 's message last week , watched by millions ; yet 75 % do n't believe he can deliver on its promise . in fact , the @entity91 wishes everyone in @entity1 did believe were the churchillian tones of @entity96 chancellor @entity95 . her message was essentially the opposite of @entity18 's bizarre optimism , which seems to involve little more than following the " @entity101 " mantra . but waiting for the upturn will find @entity1 unprepared and in a worse predicament than @entity104 or @entity105 , who are now busily restructuring their economies . the third and fundamental problem @entity18 has is that he does not understand the nature of the office he holds , the @entity110 . if he did , he might find a way forward . in his @entity88 message he likened himself to a ship 's captain . but he has to be one , not just say he is one . the office of @entity1 president is a highly complex mixture of the political and the symbolic . but it is fundamentally about leadership ; that is leading not following , and taking the @entity1 with him . @entity18 urgently needs to reset his @entity122 - and there are a few clear rules to do so : he needs to take on the banks where necessary , take on the benefits system , the impediments to innovation and to setting up new businesses , take on the appalling situation of @entity1 's forgotten inner city misery ; his need not be a hard - nosed liberal agenda . no government in @entity1 history is in a better position to make @entity1 a more equal society while making it and its economy more efficient . he should focus on young people trying to set up their own business . focus on small businesses generally . @entity142 away from its drive to over regulate everything and throttle innovation . tax the super-rich if necessary , as long as it contributes to the overall solution he is aiming for . he also needs to get into step with @entity95 and lead @entity57 with @entity96 , not pretend he is the spokesperson for the irresponsible spenders . but above all , he should use the presidency in a more imaginative way : begin an ongoing and exciting conversation with the @entity1 . no other office in the world , not even the presidency of the @entity7 , offers such scope for an intimacy between leader and population . he should boldly use the referendum to build up and direct the conversation towards change and innovation . if the vested interests wo n't move , bring in the people . use the referendum like @entity172 did between 1958 and 1962 , as a major political weapon to break the deadlocks in @entity1 political society . in @entity57 and the wider world he has to make @entity1 admired again , as it once was . inside @entity1 , he has to forget about not upsetting anyone . in fact , he should have a plan that upsets just about everybody . the @entity1 would love him for it . so far it remains to be seen what impact his first major foreign policy challenge -- in @entity185 -- will have . as @entity1 forces , with the backing of the international community , go into the @entity191 country to take on @entity193 rebels , the coming weeks will tell us whether fate just gave to him the best or the worst opportunity to show the @entity1 , and the rest of the world , what he is made of . read more : @entity1 : we 're not the pacifists you think we are the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .	@entity22:Fast Facts	@entity21:Bling	@entity82:Fran√É ¬ß	@entity110:French Presidency of the Republic	@entity88:New Year	@entity1:France	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:US	@entity9:UN Security Council	@entity193:Islamist	@entity191:West African	@entity57:Europe	@entity17:Nicolas Sarkozy	@entity14:European Union	@entity37:Harsh Economic Reality	@entity18:Hollande	@entity101:Keep Calm and Carry On	@entity172:de Gaulle	@entity104:Spain	@entity105:Italy	@entity96:Germany	@entity95:Merkel	@entity122:Presidency	@entity206:Gaffney	@entity91:New Year 's Eve	@entity142:Drag France	@entity185:Mali	@entity208:Socialists

@placeholder says part of @entity8 's appeal is his advocacy of basing dollars on precious metals	@entity215	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the annual @entity2 drew 10,000 activists to @entity0 over the weekend . the event traditionally concludes with a presidential straw poll . last year , the poll was won by @entity7 . this year , @entity8 won , with 31 percent of the ballots cast . @entity2 's organizers cautioned against over-interpreting the @entity8 win . participation in the poll had been light , the @entity8 team had just out - organized , etc. all true enough . but it 's also true that @entity8 - style themes have percolated through the conservative movement since @entity8 's beat - the - spread 2008 presidential campaign . of all those themes , the one that has achieved the widest audience is @entity8 's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver . @entity29 observed that you should never pull down a fence until you understand why it was put up . so let 's rediscover why it was that @entity34 abandoned the gold standard in the first place . in 1929 , the @entity34 economy slumped into recession . under the weight of a series of terrible decisions , that recession collapsed into the worldwide @entity43 . but why did decision - makers make so many bad decisions ? the short answer is that they were trapped . almost all of the right decisions would have ballooned the @entity34 federal budget deficit . as budget deficits expanded , investors would inevitably worry that their dollars might lose value in the future . they would demand to trade their dollars for gold at the fixed price of $ 20.67 to the ounce . under the rules of the gold standard , the @entity34 government would be obliged to sell . as long as the deficits continued , the @entity34 government would lose gold . threatened with the exhaustion of its gold supply , the government felt it had no choice : it had to close the budget deficit . so , in the throes of a severe downturn , the @entity34 government did exactly the opposite of what economists would otherwise advise : it cut spending and raised taxes -- capsizing the economy even deeper into depression . it 's very strange to hear gold standard advocates criticize president @entity78 for imposing steep tax increases in 1932 , the @entity43 's worst year . yet the gold standard they champion was the reason for the tax increases they deplore . between 1929 and 1932 , the @entity34 money supply collapsed , as banks failed and bank deposits and commercial credit vanished . in their classic " @entity88 " ( 1966 ) , @entity90 and @entity91 identified this contraction of the money supply as the proximate cause of the @entity43 . why did n't the @entity94 act to prevent the contraction ? again : the gold standard . in a modern recession , the @entity94 will buy treasury securities in the open market . after the purchase and sale , the @entity94 has more securities -- and the former owners of the securities have new cash . those new cash owners then spend or lend their cash , spurring economic activity . but in 1930 , the new cash owners did n't spend or lend . they swapped their cash for gold . the " open market " operations that were supposed to accelerate economic activity instead accelerated the country 's gold drain . so the @entity94 ceased -- and instead passively allowed the economy to collapse in order to save the nation 's currency . every other gold - standard country faced similar challenges in the 1930s . those countries that quit gold first , like @entity125 , suffered least . those that hung onto gold longest -- the @entity34 and @entity128 -- suffered most . imagine now if the gold standard were in operation today . the federal government would be scrambling to balance its budget in the midst of recession , cutting spending and raising taxes . instead of pumping money into the economy , the @entity94 would be sucking money out . priority 1 would not be creating and saving jobs , but preserving the nation 's gold hoard . instead of living through the nastiest recession since the war , we 'd be deep into a second @entity43 . but in a way , this counterfactual is impossible . no government ever can return to the gold standard . back in the 1930s , governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold . when president @entity157 told his budget director , @entity156 , of his decision to quit gold , @entity156 replied : " this is the end of @entity162 civilization . " he was n't kidding either . in fact , the decision was the turning point of the @entity43 , the beginning of recovery . and every monetary economist knows it . which means that the first thing any future gold - standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold . and every market trader knows that too . so ... as soon as the first sign of recession materializes on the horizon , the traders would dump the currency of the gold standard country . the gold standard country would then have to decide whether to self - impose draconian 1932 - style budget - balancing or forgo the whole painful experience and surrender right away to what is inevitable sooner or later . since everybody knows that a gold standard country would quit gold as soon as times got tough , nobody will ever believe the decision to restore the gold standard in the first place . it 's as dead as monocles and walking sticks . deader , really . the punch line to one of my favorite anecdotes goes , " son , your answers are so old , i have forgotten the questions . " has the @entity43 receded so far into history that the answers that once plunged the nation into misery can possibly look credible again ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of @entity215 .	@entity162:Western	@entity2:CPAC	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity7:Mitt Romney	@entity34:United States	@entity215:David Frum	@entity29:G.K.

videos of @placeholder nominee posted on @entity12 's website	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- solicitor general @entity2 , president @entity4 's pick for the @entity5 , has gone out of her way to avoid controversy during her legal career , but she can be seen and heard letting down her guard at times in videos posted on the @entity12 's website . @entity2 's appearances at seminars , graduations and alumni dinners were recorded on video by the @entity18 , where she was dean . highlights from the @entity21 hearings at a 2005 @entity18 alumni awards dinner for @entity4 , then a @entity23 senator , @entity2 gushes over the man who would become president as " her hero . " recalling how she witnessed his speech to the @entity30 , @entity2 says , " he said a few words and the place was mesmerized . you could have heard a pin drop and that 's all in part because of these rock star qualities . the eloquence , the magnetism , the great looks , the brilliance . " at the law school in 2005 , @entity2 led a panel discussion in which former @entity5 nominee @entity43 was criticized as a " stealth candidate . " " here 's the first thing . how do you pronounce her name ? " @entity2 asked to cackles in the audience . @entity43 , whom president @entity49 selected for the high court , withdrew her nomination following complaints she lacked legal heft . " honestly , the @entity54 have a little bit of reason , you know , to , you know , want to know better who this person is too , " @entity2 added . @entity2 shows funny side @entity2 , who is known among friends for having a wicked sense of humor , is seen on another video taking some digs at an event honoring @entity5 justice @entity68 . she jokingly said @entity68 's @entity18 law degree was , in her view , the best thing about him . the dean was injecting some humor into a 2008 panel discussion that featured @entity1 legal analyst @entity75 . " of course @entity77 's greatest claim to fame is that he is my classmate , the @entity18 class of ' 86 . he 's my section mate , my study group mate , all right ? @entity75 taught me everything i know about law ! " @entity2 joked to the audience . but her comments can also be serious . at a 2007 graduation ceremony for @entity18 graduates , she sharply criticized key members of the @entity87 over the administration 's secret wiretapping program . signaling out former attorney general @entity90 and ex-chief of staff @entity92 by name , @entity2 blasted the program to secretly eavesdrop on phone conversations involving terror suspects . " this is a story , to put it bluntly , of some lawyers who failed to respect the rule of law and of others ... who stood up for and vindicated it , " @entity2 said , praising former @entity98 official @entity97 who opposed portions of the wiretapping program .	@entity2:Kagan	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity12:Senate Judiciary Committee	@entity5:Supreme Court	@entity4:Obama	@entity30:2004 Democratic National Convention	@entity43:Miers	@entity98:Justice Department	@entity23:U.S.	@entity49:Bush	@entity18:Harvard Law School	@entity75:Jeffrey	@entity21:Kagan	@entity87:Bush White House	@entity68:Scalia	@entity54:Republicans	@entity97:Jack Goldsmith	@entity77:Jeff	@entity92:Andy Card	@entity90:Alberto Gonzales
@entity1 beats @placeholder to reach the semifinals of the @entity8	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- while all about him were losing their heads , @entity1 kept his cool . in a week when grand slam champions have been falling like flies at the @entity8 , the old master survived a fourth - set fightback to defeat world no. 4 @entity10 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 6 - 3 . @entity1 's win means he advances to the last four in @entity13 for the 11th year in a row , with his archrival @entity16 standing between him and a sixth final . top seed @entity16 had beaten @entity20 's @entity19 earlier on wednesday to continue his bid for a 14th grand slam title . @entity1 and @entity16 met in the semifinals two years ago , the latter emerging victorious , while the @entity25 holds a 22 - 10 winning record over the @entity28 star having won the last four matches between them . " he 's been tough to play against , no doubt , " @entity1 told reporters when asked about @entity16 . " i 'm happy i get a chance to play him in a grand slam again . i do n't remember the last time we played . " @entity1 recently recruited six - time grand slam winner @entity38 to his coaching team , with the @entity41 set to spent 10 weeks working with the former world no. 1 throughout the season . with @entity38 now onside , @entity1 is hoping he can reverse his fortunes against @entity16 . " the head - to - head record is in his favor , " the 32 - year - old told reporters . " i 'm looking forward to speaking to @entity38 , because when we spoke together , you know , when he came to @entity49 and we spoke about the game , we clearly spoke about playing @entity16 , as well . " he thought he had some good ideas , so i 'm looking forward to what he has to say . " @entity16 narrowly avoided joining second seed @entity55 -- beaten by @entity1 's compatriot @entity56 on tuesday -- on the sidelines , eventually overcoming @entity19 , the @entity20 's cheering section and a nasty blister on the @entity25 's left palm . the world @entity61 prevailed 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 2 , saving three set points in the third set . " i was so lucky , " @entity16 said in an on - court interview . " i felt anything could happen in the third set . " a lot of @entity20 here today . thanks everyone for supporting -- it was a great atmosphere . i hope you enjoyed it . i suffered a lot . " @entity16 said the blister , which troubled him in the previous round , particularly affects him on serve and he duly struck three double faults in one game . but it was @entity19 -- the man , now to his dismay , still being compared to @entity1 because of their similar styles -- who faltered on the key points . he missed a makeable forehand and return on two of his three set points in the third . his backers were frequently out of their chairs chanting his name throughout the three - and - a - half - hour encounter , prompting one fan to counter , " shut up and sit down . " @entity19 left the court in tears and then became emotional when speaking to reporters .

@placeholder pleads for her life , saying she could make a difference in prison	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- after more than seven hours of deliberations , jurors still have n't decided whether @entity3 will live or die . the @entity5 jury sent out a note wednesday morning saying its members could n't agree . judge @entity8 told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room . it was another unexpected turn in the dramatic , high - profile murder trial , which has lasted for months , sparked a media frenzy and drawn spectators who line up for courtroom seats . earlier this month , the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that @entity18 was " exceptionally cruel " in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend @entity3 29 times , slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face . they pronounced her guilty of first - degree murder two weeks ago after 15 hours of deliberations . now , the jury is weighing whether @entity18 , 32 , should get the death penalty . after jurors told @entity8 they were stuck on wednesday , the judge encouraged them to listen to each other , pinpoint areas of agreement and disagreement and ask for further guidance if they need it . it 's an approach often described as a " dynamite charge , " used by judges to blast open logjams in deliberations and help jurors reach a verdict . it 's unclear whether her advice worked . after @entity8 ordered them to continue their discussions , jurors deliberated for more than four more hours , then went home for the day . the jury 's decision must be unanimous for @entity18 to be sentenced to death . in the case of a deadlock , a new jury would be chosen for this phase of the trial . a plea for mercy a path of heartbreak , violence , lies and confessions has led @entity18 to the @entity67 courtroom where her life is now in a jury 's hands . on tuesday , she pleaded with jurors to spare her . it was a stark reversal from two weeks ago , when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison . " i believe death is the ultimate freedom , so i 'd rather just have my freedom as soon as i can get it , " she told @entity80 shortly after her conviction . but her family implored her to change her mind , she told @entity80 late tuesday . now she wants to spare them further heartbreak , she said . " one of my cousins really drove it home for me and told me how much it would affect them , if i did anything to myself , " she said . her mother pleaded with her , she claimed . " please do n't give up ; please do n't give up , " @entity18 said she told her . have n't been following the trial ? read this well - planned presentation her life seemed to pass before her , as she delivered a slideshow presentation -- mostly of family photos -- to the jury on tuesday . it started off with pictures of her as a toddler wearing pigtails and showed several images from holidays and vacations with family members . she read a prepared statement for nearly 20 minutes , at times crying . @entity18 told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child . she had claimed she killed @entity121 in self - defense after he hurt her , something evidence failed to substantiate . she called his murder " the worst mistake " she 'd ever made , " the worst thing i 've ever done . " she could n't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime , @entity18 told the jury . " but i know that i was , " she said . " and for that i 'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer . " @entity18 pledged to make herself useful to other prisoners and humanity by performing acts of charity from behind bars , if spared . she told jurors tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and pledged to dedicate her life to good causes . she noted she could bring " people together in a constructive and positive way " by participating in various programs , including prisoner literacy initiatives ; by her " @entity150 " t - shirts , which would benefit victims of domestic violence ; and by donating her hair , so it could be used to make wigs for sick children . she showed the jurors several pieces of her artwork . she told them she would suffer for what she did . " i 'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices , " she said . " i wo n't be at my sister 's wedding , when she ties the knot next year . " attorneys argue life and death defense attorney @entity165 argued tuesday that @entity18 ' life should be spared . " we 're not talking about whether or not to convict . we 're talking about whether or not to kill . and so when we talk about that , it matters that she was 27 years old and she had no criminal history , " she said . " it matters that she had n't done anything wrong in her life before that . " prosecutor @entity177 said pointing to @entity18 ' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared was n't a valid defense . " it 's an entitlement road that they want you to travel when they talk to you about the fact that she 's a good artist , " he said . " it does n't mean anything . all it means is : give her special or preferential treatment . " he argued that jurors should sentence @entity18 to death . " you have a duty , and that duty really means that you actually do the honest , right thing , even though it may be difficult , " he said . if @entity18 is given a sentence of death , she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of @entity5 . when @entity121 died @entity18 was living in @entity205 , @entity206 , when she met @entity121 at a business convention in @entity209 in september 2006 . that november , he baptized @entity18 into the @entity212 faith , a ceremony @entity18 said was followed by anal sex . @entity18 became his girlfriend two months later , she testified . they broke up in the summer of 2007 , and @entity121 began dating other women . @entity121 's naked body was found crammed in a stand - up shower in june 2008 after he missed two appointments , prompting friends to go to his house . he had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head . his throat was slit . after her arrest , @entity18 told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into @entity121 's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped . relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable . @entity238 : friend of @entity18 tweeting on her behalf @entity241 's @entity240 and @entity243 's @entity242 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Jodi Arias	@entity206:California	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Arizona	@entity212:Mormon	@entity165:Jennifer Willmott	@entity238:HLNTV.com	@entity177:Juan Martinez	@entity18:Arias	@entity80:KSAZ	@entity209:Las Vegas	@entity243:In Session	@entity242:Grace Wong	@entity241:HLN	@entity240:Graham Winch	@entity67:Phoenix	@entity150:Survivor	@entity8:Stephens	@entity205:Yreka	@entity121:Alexander

" we strongly suspect , but have not confirmed , he is in @entity5 , " @entity47 spokesman @entity50 . @entity50 said the @entity47 plans to circulate in @entity5 either matchbooks or business cards with @entity9 's photo . the @entity3 's wanted poster is on the @entity56 with a $ 25,000 reward . police believe @entity33 was killed december 14 , the same day she bought a bus ticket for travel for the following day . but in the note provided to police by @entity9 's wife , the corporal claimed @entity33 killed herself december 15 . police said an autopsy revealed the pregnant @entity3 was killed by a blow to the head . police said they are analyzing a possible murder weapon provided by an undisclosed witness . a spokesman told @entity0 it could several weeks to determine whether it was used to kill @entity33 . @entity9 's wife told police about the note january 11 , a day after she said @entity9 told her what allegedly happened and following a meeting with a lawyer . police describe her as a cooperating witness . @entity33 was scheduled to testify last month at a military hearing after accusing @entity9 of raping her last spring . on monday , the @entity13 sheriff 's office released new photographs of the fire pit in @entity86 's backyard taken just before @entity33 's body was discovered january 11 . police said some neighbors reported seeing a group of @entity3 having a @entity92 barbecue in @entity9 's backyard . police also released photographs that show @entity9 's living room and garage with paint cans . investigators said they found blood in more than one room of @entity9 's home , some of which was covered by fresh paint . the sheriff 's office said it has documented evidence @entity9 bought paint , concrete blocks and a wheelbarrow at a home improvement store december 16 . in a store surveillance video , @entity9 is seen walking into the store with another man , who has not been identified . investigators are also awaiting the results of @entity119 paternity tests , which they said could take weeks , to tell whether @entity9 was the father of @entity33 's unborn child . e-mail to a friend	@entity3:Marine	@entity17:State Department	@entity1:Cesar Laurean	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Onslow County	@entity12:Hudson	@entity5:Mexico	@entity24:United States	@entity9:Laurean	@entity33:Lance Cpl.

similar pumps were used in @placeholder , which was eventually encased in concrete	@entity119	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- one of the world 's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to @entity6 , all part of the effort to address the crisis at the @entity11 nuclear power plant . the 190,000 - pound truck pump was moved off a job on the @entity14 on wednesday and , two days later , was in @entity15 , @entity16 . once preparations are complete , it will head about 7,000 miles toward @entity19 aboard a @entity22 @entity21 cargo plane , which is considered among the world 's biggest aircrafts . the @entity26 @entity25 had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern @entity29 . eventually , nuclear waste is to be disposed of here . but the decision was made to transfer it to @entity6 -- along with several other such large pumps , from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a march 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation . " i use the pump every day at the river site , but they 're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day , " said @entity45 , the owner of @entity46 that supplies concrete for the @entity14 facility . " they need all this equipment . they need help . " @entity58 officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend . then , @entity29 's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits , which are required due to the pumper truck 's immensity . eventually , it will be driven south to @entity0 , to be ideally flown out of the country by next friday . @entity45 did n't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to @entity6 , though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility 's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material . " i understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done , " said @entity45 . the big pump , one of a handful of such trucks built by the the @entity87 company @entity86 , appears to be tailor - made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment . its 70 - meter boom can be controlled remotely , which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance , say experts . typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete , such as the construction of bridges or high - rise buildings . according to @entity86 's website , the company has already re-directed a truck - mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in @entity19 to head to the @entity11 site , which is 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity109 . another smaller @entity86 pumper , currently in @entity111 , is also being readied to fly to @entity6 . this is not the first time the @entity87 company 's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis . in 1986 , 11 @entity86 concrete pumps were used after the @entity119 accident in @entity120 , then a part of the @entity122 . the reactors ' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete , to prevent the further release of any more radiation .	@entity22:Russian	@entity21:Antonov 225	@entity26:U.S.	@entity86:Putzmeister	@entity25:Department of Energy	@entity29:Georgia	@entity111:Los Angeles	@entity87:German	@entity119:Chernobyl	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Atlanta	@entity6:Japan	@entity58:Company	@entity16:South Carolina	@entity15:Hanahan	@entity14:Savannah River	@entity11:Fukushima Daiichi	@entity19:Southeast Asia	@entity109:Tokyo	@entity122:Soviet Union	@entity120:Ukraine	@entity45:Ashmore	@entity46:Ashmore Concrete Contractors
@entity2 said he hopes that @entity69 rep. @placeholder can end his career with dignity	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- president @entity2 hopes embattled @entity4 congressman @entity3 can end his career with dignity . " i think @entity3 served a very long time and served his constituents very well . but these allegations are very troubling , " @entity2 said on friday in an interview with @entity11 ' @entity10 . " he 's somebody who 's at the end of his career . eighty years old . i 'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity . and my hope is that it happens . " @entity2 added . @entity2 commented friday just hours after a subcommittee of the @entity20 recommended that the @entity22 @entity21 be reprimanded . a reprimand would be a relatively light punishment , compared with censure and expulsion . the recommendation was made to the ethics committee before thursday 's public hearing detailing charges against @entity3 . the full committee and the @entity20 would have to approve any sanction against @entity3 . asked about the recommendation , @entity3 initially told @entity1 on friday that it 's " untrue . " @entity3 's attorney , however , later said that the embattled congressman " misspoke " and the possibility of a reprimand " was one of a number of issues addressed in settlement discussions . " the full committee has accused @entity3 of 13 violations of @entity20 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity47 . among other things , @entity3 has been charged with using his influence to solicit donations for a college policy center bearing his name from corporate heads and others with business before the powerful @entity56 that @entity3 chaired until forced to give up the leadership position earlier this year . other charges involve alleged income tax and financial disclosure violations , as well as improper use of government mail service and letterhead . an ethics committee trial of @entity3 is still set to be held , most likely in september , barring a settlement between @entity3 and the committee members .	@entity3:Rangel	@entity2:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity11:CBS News	@entity4:New York	@entity10:Harry Smith	@entity20:House	@entity22:Harlem	@entity47:Congress	@entity21:Democrat	@entity56:House Ways and Means Committee	@entity69:U.S.
@entity113 is no threat to established tv companies like @entity125 or @placeholder	@entity126	editor 's note : this is another in a series of @entity5 commentaries debunking common tech myths . ( @entity5 ) -- @entity7 and ceo @entity8 have celebrated a string of huge hits over the past several years , including the @entity11 , the @entity12 and the @entity13 . reviews have been mostly glowing , sales have been strong and investors have cheered , sending the stock up 40 % over the past 12 months . @entity7 , which was struggling a decade ago , is now the world 's most admired and highly valued tech company . but @entity7 is not perfect . in fact , the company has several weaknesses to address : 1 ) the cloud . @entity7 has been bragging about how the @entity12 is a " post-pc " device , but you still need to plug it into a computer to activate and sync it . the easiest way to get photos off your @entity11 is to email them to yourself . you still ca n't sync your @entity32 music over @entity33 or @entity34 . this is a shame . @entity7 needs to think about the cloud the way @entity38 does -- as the future of mobile services . you should n't be tied to a usb cord to access files . you should n't need a pc to use a " post-pc " @entity12 . you should n't have to email a map link from your computer to your @entity11 . perhaps this is part of @entity7 's new version of @entity50 , due sometime this year . ( see our list of suggestions for @entity50 here . ) the company has a huge new data center in @entity56 and ca n't be blind to the fact that other companies -- @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity38 , etc. -- are doing very cool things with the cloud . but for now , @entity7 is still weak here -- @entity65 and @entity7 's @entity64 push notifications not withstanding . 2 ) @entity67 . @entity7 has tried to do " social " a bit with @entity69 , its social network based around @entity32 music , and @entity72 , its social gaming service . they are n't huge hits . @entity7 has not been able to go as deep integrating @entity76 or other social networks into its products as some @entity80 devices or @entity82 's @entity81 have . some of this could be to reduce @entity7 's dependence on other companies , so the @entity11 is more reliable . but it seems that @entity7 and @entity8 do n't really get social , and do n't see its value . that could burn them in the long run . or perhaps , again , this could be addressed in the next version of @entity50 . for instance , @entity7 could go a long way by making the @entity11 's built - in @entity95 app more social , like the popular @entity97 app. and @entity7 's marketing boss @entity98 is all over @entity97 . so it 's not like the company is n't highly aware of what 's out there . this is n't to say that @entity7 should replicate @entity76 , or even try to build its own general - purpose social network . but integrating your existing online social connections could be useful for many of @entity7 's products , ranging from the @entity11 's address book to the @entity109 to photo sharing . so it 's time for @entity7 to do more here . 3 ) @entity112 . the new @entity113 just got a small upgrade , in the form of live video streaming for @entity118 and @entity119 games . but it 's still the weakest of @entity7 's products , with a relatively limited selection of video . and it 's definitely not something tv companies like @entity125 or @entity126 are worried about . @entity7 could improve @entity113 with an app store within the next year or so -- gaming could be big ! -- and more video content sooner . but it 's a challenge , because this is a situation where @entity7 has to decide between being a good platform -- and allowing rival companies like @entity134 , @entity135 , or @entity60 to thrive -- and being a dominant content seller by keeping an @entity32 monopoly . the good news for @entity7 is that no one else is really putting up a fight here yet . @entity142 is n't a big success , while @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 have n't caught on with mainstream consumers . so @entity7 can take its time . @entity149 , @entity7 may even come out with an actual television someday . also , these are all areas where @entity7 is relatively in control of its destiny , and can make improvements . there are some other areas where @entity7 is vulnerable , such as the threat posed by @entity38 's @entity80 system , and possible production problems because of the earthquake and tsunami in @entity163 . but that 's a different list . copyright ¬© 2010 @entity5 .	@entity80:Android	@entity81:Windows Phone 7	@entity82:Microsoft	@entity113:Apple TV	@entity112:The living room	@entity135:Hulu	@entity134:Netflix	@entity119:NBA	@entity118:MLB	@entity97:Instagram	@entity173:Ping and GameCenter	@entity7:Apple	@entity5:Business Insider	@entity8:Steve Jobs	@entity50:iOS	@entity56:North Carolina	@entity59:Dropbox	@entity76:Facebook	@entity72:GameCenter	@entity33:Wi-Fi	@entity32:iTunes	@entity13:MacBook Air	@entity12:iPad	@entity11:iPhone	@entity145:Roku	@entity38:Google	@entity34:3G	@entity98:Phil Schiller	@entity126:DirecTV	@entity109:App Store	@entity95:Photos	@entity125:Comcast	@entity144:Boxee	@entity163:Japan	@entity146:TiVo Premiere	@entity142:Google TV	@entity149:Heck	@entity69:Ping	@entity67:Social	@entity64:iOS	@entity65:MobileMe	@entity60:Amazon
prince @placeholder denies knowing about ex-wife 's alleged offer to sell access to him	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 's prince @entity3 has denied knowing anything about his ex-wife @entity6 's alleged offer to an undercover tabloid newspaper reporter to sell access to @entity11 's second son for ¬£ 500,000 ( $ 723,000 ) . his comments came after @entity13 posted a video on its web site sunday that appears to show @entity6 accepting money from an undercover reporter in exchange for an introduction to prince @entity3 . @entity6 is also filmed on hidden camera telling the reporter -- who was posing as a wealthy businessman -- that a payment of ¬£ 500,000 " opens doors " to @entity3 . she then shakes hands with the reporter after he accepts the deal . on monday the royal family moved quickly to distance itself from @entity6 , who has never been far from the headlines since she married prince @entity3 , the @entity32 , in 1986 . the couple separated in 1992 and divorced four years later . " the @entity32 categorically denies any knowledge of any meeting or conversation between the @entity6 and the @entity13 journalist , " @entity34 said . prince @entity3 has carried out his role as a @entity4 trade envoy since 2001 " with complete and absolute propriety and integrity , " the palace said . in a statement issued sunday , @entity6 , 50 , apologized for the incident . " i very deeply regret the situation and the embarrassment caused , " the statement said . " it is true that my financial situation is under stress , however , that is no excuse for a serious lapse in judgment and i am very sorry that this has happened . " the tabloid said its reporter and @entity6 met on two occasions , once in @entity59 and another time in @entity0 . read more about @entity6 in the heavily edited , roughly four - minute video , @entity6 appears to accept $ 40,000 as a down payment for a meeting with @entity3 , then later discusses a wire transfer of the larger sum . " if we want to do a big deal with @entity3 , then that 's the big one , " she says . when asked how she would receive the ¬£ 500,000 , she tells the reporter , " you send it to the bank account that i tell you to send it to . " " then that , is then like you open up all the channels whatever you need , whatever you want ... and then you meet @entity3 and that 's fine . and that 's ... when you really open up whatever you want . but then that opens up everything that ever you would ever wish . " the tabloid said prince @entity3 , 50 , who has been the @entity4 's special representative for international trade and business since 2001 , was not aware of the deal . in the video , @entity6 tells the reporter that @entity3 " never does accept a penny for anything . ... he does not and will not and he is completely whiter than white . " in her statement sunday , @entity6 confirmed @entity3 " was not aware or involved in any of the discussions that occurred . ... the duke has made a significant contribution to his business role over the last 10 years and has always acted with complete integrity .

" we do n't have very high hopes " for major reforms , a @placeholder official says	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- president @entity3 's commission investigating last year 's oil disaster is giving environmental groups hope that some change is on the horizon , but not the full scope of what they 're looking for , two groups told @entity0 thursday . " if you take the findings to heart , you would n't start drilling again , " said @entity11 , research director with @entity12 . on wednesday , the @entity17 on the @entity18 and @entity19 released a chapter of its coming report , saying " systemic " problems caused the blowout and that only " significant reform " would prevent another . " the macondo blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 , which government regulators lacked the authority , the necessary resources , and the technical expertise to prevent , " the report says . @entity38 was the name of the well . @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 all were involved in the drilling operation . @entity12 and the @entity42 told @entity0 there were no surprises in the released chapter . " it kind of confirms our worst fears that we 've had about the oil industry all along -- that they cut corners where they can , " said @entity46 , director of lands protection with the @entity42 . " and that sometimes threatens the safety and operation of their rigs . " @entity46 said he believes the president will take the commission 's findings seriously . " administratively , we 're confident that the @entity3 administration will change the way oil companies do business in the @entity65 . " but , he said , his group is not holding out hope for major legislative change . " i imagine that the @entity69 in charge of the @entity71 , and now the new speaker , do n't want to see any new restrictions on the oil industry , " he said . @entity12 's @entity11 said the chapter released " puts an exclamation point on the fact that the corporations were at fault , " though he noted that a lack of government oversight also is to blame . " what we hope is that the commission 's recommendations are taken to heart by the president , " he said . but @entity11 added , " we do n't have very high hopes for the reforms that should happen -- a massive overhaul of the regulatory apparatus and oversight . " " ultimately , " he said , " i think the oil industry will succeed in blocking things like that . " the group @entity96 also weighed in with a statement , saying the early draft indicates the commission " will recommend important reforms . " the group added , " we now look to the government and industry to step up to the plate . " the @entity105 , the main group representing the oil industry , told @entity0 thursday it did not yet have a response to the chapter released by the commission . @entity32 issued a response , accusing the commission of having " selectively omitted information we provided to them . " the company also disagreed with certain specifics , saying the report mischaracterized foam stability tests . @entity33 issued a statement saying its crew had taken " appropriate actions to gain control of the well . they were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business . " @entity31 spokesman @entity125 said wednesday the oil giant " has cooperated fully with the commission 's investigation , " stressing that " the accident was the result of multiple causes , involving multiple companies . " " @entity31 is working with regulators and the industry to ensure that the lessons learned from @entity38 lead to improvements in operations and contractor services in deepwater drilling , " @entity125 said . the @entity141 @entity140 said it , too , is already implementing reforms . " the agency has taken unprecedented steps and will continue to make the changes necessary to restore the @entity141 people 's confidence in the safety and environmental soundness of oil and gas drilling and production on the @entity153 , while balancing our nation 's important energy needs , " spokeswoman @entity143 said .	@entity17:National Commission	@entity153:Outer Continental Shelf	@entity3:Obama	@entity0:CNN	@entity71:Natural Resources Committee	@entity31:BP	@entity33:Transocean	@entity32:Halliburton	@entity12:Greenpeace	@entity11:Davies	@entity38:Macondo	@entity19:Offshore Drilling	@entity18:BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill	@entity105:American Petroleum Institute	@entity96:Ocean Conservancy	@entity125:Sholars	@entity161:Deepwater Horizon	@entity140:Department of the Interior	@entity141:American	@entity143:Kendra Barkoff	@entity46:Manuel	@entity42:Sierra Club	@entity69:Republicans	@entity65:Gulf
