critics have accused @placeholder of becoming a new dictator	@entity23	( @entity0 ) -- two years ago , @entity1 toppled a longtime dictator and reveled in the hope of a new future . but frustration over the new leadership and controversial court verdicts have ignited clashes regularly . here 's what 's behind the most recent unrest , which flared up on the two - year anniversary of the revolution . what sparked this latest rash of violence ? two seemingly unrelated developments . friday was the two - year anniversary of the 2011 @entity1 revolution . protesters who have been angry with the slow pace of change and with some of the steps president @entity23 has taken clashed with his supporters and police in the cities such as @entity28 and @entity29 . at least seven people were killed in those clashes , including several by gunfire . it was not immediately clear who was responsible . then on saturday , a judge issued death sentences for 21 people from @entity38 for their roles in a football game riot last year . the court rulings sparked deadly clashes between security forces and relatives of the convicted . over the course of two days , at least 38 people -- including civilians and soldiers -- were killed in @entity38 . ` dubbed the " massacre at @entity38 " by @entity1 media , the riot broke out on february 1 , 2012 , after @entity38 - based @entity52 defeated @entity54 's @entity53 , 3 - 1 . the riot left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured . fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs . it was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife sparked the melee . what 's the back story of tensions between @entity38 and @entity54 ? @entity38 residents say they have grievances that date back six decades . over the past 60 years , residents of @entity38 have felt betrayed by @entity1 security forces during a series of wars with @entity75 . thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the @entity78 , the @entity79 of 1967 , the @entity80 with @entity75 , and the @entity81 . residents of @entity38 , in northeastern @entity1 , believed security forces did not adequately defend their city . in addition , some say @entity54 has not invested enough in @entity38 's infrastructure , and that their city does n't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though @entity38 via the critical @entity90 . some also say @entity38 is still getting the cold shoulder from @entity54 after a 1999 assassination attempt of then - president @entity93 , who was visiting the city . why are some @entity1 angry with @entity23 ? @entity23 , @entity1 's first democratically elected president , came to power last june following @entity93 's ouster a year earlier . but accusations of power hoarding soon followed . @entity23 issued a sweeping presidential decree in november , which prevented any court from overturning his decisions until a new , @entity104 constitution was passed . the ruling essentially gave him unchecked power , protecting from judicial review any decisions he has made since assuming office . protesters decried the " birth of a new pharaoh " and " @entity23 the dictator . " but @entity23 defended his move , saying it was only temporary until a new constitution is put in place . he said it was intended to safeguard the revolution , in part by preventing courts from interfering with the work of @entity1 's @entity123 , the body charged with drafting a new constitution . the judges , many of whom were holdover loyalists from the government of @entity93 , are widely viewed as hostile to the @entity129 who now dominate the assembly that has been charged with framing a new constitution . the constitution eventually passed with a nearly two - thirds majority . what happens now ? during a speech sunday night , @entity23 declared a limited state of emergency for violent hot spots and announced a 30 - day nighttime curfew for the provinces of @entity38 , @entity29 and @entity28 . @entity23 said some protesters ' violent behavior " does not have anything to do with the @entity1 revolution . ... in fact , it is against the revolution . " but he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in @entity1 , saying " dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security . " to this end , he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting monday . the meeting " is meant to address problems in @entity1 , as opposed to express anger , " @entity23 's spokesman told state - run tv . but for a country that has seen rounds of change , dissent , celebration and violence , it 's unclear what the next chapter will be . @entity0 's @entity171 and @entity172 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Morsy	@entity28:Suez	@entity29:Ismailia	@entity80:War of Attrition	@entity81:1973 Arab-Israeli War	@entity171:Reza Sayah	@entity1:Egypt	@entity0:CNN	@entity53:Al-Ahly	@entity52:Al-Masry	@entity79:Six-Day War	@entity78:Suez War	@entity54:Cairo	@entity75:Israel	@entity38:Port Said	@entity172:Tim Hume	@entity104:post-Mubarak	@entity129:Islamists	@entity93:Mubarak	@entity123:Constituent Assembly	@entity90:Suez Canal	@entity180:Chaos
new : @entity8 @entity12 says it rescues about 55 @placeholder	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- at least 17 people have died and dozens more were rescued after their boat capsized off the @entity3 and @entity4 in the @entity5 on wednesday , according to the local government and @entity8 officials . the @entity12 , assisting the islands ' rescue crews , retrieved about 55 @entity13 in waters 100 meters from shore , the @entity8 agency said . they fell into the water when their overloaded sail freighter tipped over , the guard said . the nationalities of the 17 dead people were n't immediately clear wednesday , but 12 were males and five were female adults , said @entity24 , commissioner of @entity25 . earlier reports had put the death toll at 18 . @entity24 added that the search for additional casualties concluded late wednesday because of darkness and worsening seas . the search will resume thursday , he said . although the @entity12 put the number of rescued at near 55 , local authorities used different numbers . a total of 33 people -- 21 men including a child and 12 females -- were detained as suspected illegal @entity13 migrants and " will be repatriated to @entity13 at the earliest opportunity , " @entity24 said . officials could n't be immediately reached for comment to explain the discrepancy between the approximate 55 rescues the @entity12 cited and the 33 detainees @entity24 discussed . the @entity4 government said in a @entity48 statement that a sailing vessel believed to be carrying suspected illegal migrants was intercepted by the @entity51 of the islands ' police force after 3 a.m. wednesday . two hours later , while the boat was being towed to a dock to unload the suspects , the sloop capsized , the statement said . " the stricken vessel has now been removed from the water and will be central to our ongoing investigations into this matter , " @entity24 said . " we must all remain vigilant to combat illegal migration . " he thanked police officers and emergency personnel for working under what he called " challenging circumstances . " police were searching wednesday " for the handful of people who reached shore and fled the scene , " the government said . the @entity3 and @entity4 are a @entity75 territory . the incident occurred near the country 's island of @entity79 , commonly known as " @entity79 " and described on the official tourism website as its most developed isle where most international flights arrive . the 33 rescued people -- all @entity13 -- were in custody of the government 's immigration detention - removal center , @entity24 said . authorities revised that figure from an earlier reported count of 32 rescued people . @entity13 migrants seeking to enter the @entity8 have used the @entity3 and @entity4 and the @entity92 as way stations to enter the @entity8 . migrants appear undeterred , even after deadly shipwrecks @entity0 's @entity96 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Turks	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Haitians	@entity12:Coast Guard	@entity24:Farquhar	@entity5:Caribbean	@entity4:Caicos Islands	@entity92:Bahamas	@entity51:Marine Branch	@entity79:Provo	@entity75:British	@entity96:Elwyn Lopez	@entity25:Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force	@entity48:Facebook	@entity8:U.S.
excitement for games like " @placeholder , " questions about others to come	@entity106	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 released details about its upcoming @entity4 console during a news conference thursday . but , as happens in the age of social media , reactions began pouring in just as fast as the facts were coming out . the @entity14 game company made announcements in @entity14 , the @entity16 and @entity17 , each one talking about the three main points everyone has been wanting to know : when will wii u be available , how much will it cost , and what games can i play on it ? prices and release dates vary around the world , but @entity16 gamers will get first crack november 18 . a basic version of the console package will sell for $ 299 , while a " deluxe " version -- including additional memory , a stand and charger for the @entity29 , and the " @entity31 " game -- will go for $ 349 . reaction in the gaming community ranged dramatically from joy to pessimism . as prices for the two versions of the console were announced , a split seemed to form over whether the @entity4 was too expensive for what it appears to be offering . @entity44 , a commenter on the @entity0 story , said , " @entity47 ca n't see myself spending money on another product like this . i 'll wait for the 720 ( @entity52 whatever it is called ) or the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) 4 . " @entity57 host and reality - tv vet @entity56 joked on @entity59 , " not a fan of the @entity4 's price but i 'm getting it for my kid because even though the child has n't been born yet i will buy his / her affection . " however , others were just as quick to point out the history of new console release prices . @entity59 user @entity69 reminded people what the @entity72 cost when it came out in 2006 . " i still do n't get the fuss over the @entity4 price , " he tweeted . " the @entity72 was five hundred ninety - nine dollars at launch . " a @entity59 user in the @entity78 offered an international perspective on the price battle . @entity81 tweeted , " dear @entity16 friends , please stop complaining that the @entity83 is $ 350 . in the @entity78 , it will be Â £ 330 ( $ 533 ) and ship without a sensor bar ! ! ! " if it was n't the dollars ( or yen or euros ) being discussed , the topic centered on the games being offered . @entity1 president @entity89 said that more than 50 games would be available from the launch to the end of march but did n't say specifically which titles would be available at launch . some games drew more attention than others . " @entity106 " was announced as a @entity4 exclusive , drawing howls of protest and disbelief from many on social media who enjoyed the original on other consoles . others were excited about the news . @entity109 from @entity110 wrote on @entity59 , " well i guess i 'm gunna have to buy a @entity4 now since @entity106 is only going to be on that platform . i apologize to my @entity52 and @entity72 . " the variety of announced titles tried to hit as many different genres and fan bases as possible . many people found at least one game that attracted them to the new wii u console . @entity119 , commenting on the @entity121 story , wrote , " sold . i was almost positive that i was getting a @entity4 before , but with @entity122 coming ... please , take my money . " video game writer @entity124 said on @entity59 , " @entity31 sold me on the @entity126 of fun with those games today . never mind the brilliance of @entity130 ( " @entity130 " ) and lots of others . " @entity133 added , " looking at @entity134 changed my opinion of @entity4 . excited . hope @entity1 release more than a handful of games aimed at adults this time . " despite reports of brisk pre-orders , other people urged caution and patience before rushing out to get the new console . some are worried @entity1 is just playing catch - up to @entity148 and @entity149 , and wonder what happens when their new consoles arrive . " i do n't hate the # @entity4 , but there 's nothing yet that demands a day 1 buy , " wrote @entity152 on @entity59 . " can we not be nintendo fanboys just this once please internet ? " @entity160 is concerned about next - generation consoles . " what 's so special about the @entity4 ? it 's just a wii with @entity72 graphics and a tablet . come on @entity1 be more creative ! " " i 'm still not impressed . if it 's only ' on par with current consoles ' ... the ones that are at the end of their cycle ... that 's scary , " wrote @entity167 ( @entity59 handle : @ reluctant_gamer ) . still , commenters generally agreed that the @entity4 will sell well in the beginning , pointing out how successful the @entity4 console sold on launch . the trick is to sustain that initial momentum , many say , will be releasing a stable of good games people will want to play . two game reviewers said they were hopeful for the outlook for the new console . @entity187 , video game columnist for the @entity189 , said , " i 'm optimistic because of more info on good exclusives . plus it seems genuinely different from the rest of the crowd . i 'm up for a change of pace . " and a @entity59 post by @entity198 , senior editor for the @entity199 , may sum up the overall feelings of many about the @entity4 -- at least for now . " @entity4 : more expensive than i 'd like , software focus on casual , but a ton of potential . overall ? ca n't wait . " what do you think about @entity1 's announcement ? let us know in the comments below .	@entity17:Europe	@entity133:David MacArthur	@entity29:GamePad	@entity81:Larry Bundy Jr.	@entity83:Deluxe Wii U	@entity110:Canada	@entity89:Reggie Fils-Aime	@entity130:New Super Mario Bros.

24 of @entity1 's cabinet members met at base of @placeholder to highlight impact of climate change	@entity5	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 's cabinet met at the base of @entity5 on friday to highlight the impact of climate change on the @entity8 and adopted a 10 - point @entity9 . " the @entity8 are important not only for the people of @entity1 but for 1.3 billion people who depend on waters from the mountains for their livelihoods , " said @entity1 's prime minister @entity10 at the cabinet meeting broadcast live by state - owned @entity12 . wearing oxygen masks and warm jackets , the cabinet met for about half an hour at @entity21 at an altitude of 5,242 meters surrounded by the world 's highest mountains and glaciers . the ministers flew in to @entity27 , in the @entity5 region where the nearest airstrip is , a day earlier to acclimatize to the rarefied atmosphere of @entity21 . the cabinet met out in the open where tables had been set up . the ministers spoke through microphones because it was difficult to hear even over a short distance with the wind blowing . of the 27 cabinet ministers , 24 were present at the meeting and they were wearing blue sashes that said " save the @entity8 . " the sun was shining bright during the meeting in the morning but in the afternoon fog descended and the wind grew fiercer . before they were airlifted by helicopters to @entity21 the ministers ' health was checked to ensure they could withstand the high altitude and not suffer from acute mountain sickness because of the low amount of oxygen in the atmosphere at that altitude . " this is a very important and historic meeting , " prime minister @entity1 said . the meeting comes ahead of the @entity58 climate summit in @entity59 next week . the @entity8 have an important role in the world 's environmental balance , he added . the melting of the glaciers in the mountains due to global warming would bring about a scarcity of water in the river systems in @entity71 , affecting more than a billion people in @entity1 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , according to various experts . " but there has not been enough study to say exactly how much of the river water comes from the melting of the snow and ice in the mountains , " said @entity78 , a climate change expert from the @entity80 , a @entity0 - based think tank . " estimates vary between four to 10 percent . " @entity78 , however , added that in specific areas in the mountains where people depend on the melting of specific glaciers for irrigation , the change in the snow system will affect livelihoods . there has been an annual increase of temperature by 0.06 degrees @entity100 over the past decade , according to a study conducted earlier this year by @entity78 together with @entity102 . it it estimated that the temperature in @entity1 could rise by as much as two @entity100 by 2030 . rainfall patterns have also been erratic and this affects the livelihoods of almost two thirds of @entity1 's population of 28 million who depend on rain - fed agriculture . " various global circulation models show that precipitation could go down by 14 percent or increase by as much as 40 percent by 2030 , " @entity78 told @entity2 . although the contribution of @entity1 , one of the poorest countries in the world , to carbon emissions is negligible , the poor and the marginalized bear the brunt of climate change , prime minister @entity10 said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting . the 10 - point @entity9 the cabinet adopted includes increasing the protected area of @entity1 's land from 20 percent to 25 percent , developing communities ' capacity to cope with climate change and working together with other countries to mitigate the impact of global warming . the declaration also supported developed countries ' plans to contribute 1.5 percent of gdp to a climate fund and bring down greenhouse gases to pre-industrialization levels . " the earth is our common abode , " said prime minister @entity1 . " to save the earth the biggest sacrifice is needed from nations producing large amounts of carbon .

" it was sickening , " ex-president tells @placeholder 's @entity18 of the @entity286 crash in @entity75	@entity0	( @entity0 ) -- former president @entity1 acknowledges he got " very close " to helping achieve peace in the @entity3 shortly before ending his eight years in office . over a two - week period in 2000 , @entity1 played host at @entity6 to then - @entity8 prime minister @entity7 and @entity10 chairman @entity9 . the summit ultimately ended without agreement . two @entity15 presidents later , the conflict rages on . now , @entity1 is less optimistic @entity3 negotiators will get that close again , telling @entity0 's @entity18 that peace between @entity8 and the @entity20 is impossible until @entity21 renounces violence . " there is no way the @entity8 are going to give up the @entity25 and agree to a state unless @entity21 agrees to give up violence and recognizes @entity8 's right to exist , " he said in the interview airing monday on " @entity29 . " " they wo n't do it so that 's a non-starter and i think it should be . you ca n't just have a one - way peace . both sides have got to give up what the other side most objects to . " there 's still hope for peace in the @entity3 @entity8 - @entity10 relations are at a low point . @entity8 military forces began a ground offensive into @entity46 on thursday , inflicting heavy casualties . more than 400 @entity20 have been killed since the latest outbreak of violence . at least 13 @entity8 soldiers were killed in fighting in @entity46 on sunday , the @entity8 military said . nevertheless , @entity1 said he 's not giving up hope for peace in the region . " we dance around the bush so many times and sooner or later someone will jump off the merry go round and do the right thing , " he said . " we got very close in 2000 . " @entity1 was interviewed by @entity18 during stops on the former president 's eight - day tour of @entity63 , which included a visit to an @entity66 orphanage in @entity67 ahead of the @entity68 in @entity69 . the conference opened sunday on a somber note -- at least six delegates traveling to the event were killed thursday when @entity74 17 exploded over eastern @entity75 . @entity1 is scheduled to give a keynote address at the conference on wednesday . " they 're really , in a way , martyrs to the cause we are going to @entity88 to talk about , " @entity1 said of the researchers who died when unknown attackers shot their plane down over a rebel - controlled area of eastern @entity75 . " thinking about those people being knocked out of the sky , it 's pretty tough . " on the crash of the @entity93 itself , @entity1 was careful not to draw immediate conclusions on who was responsible for the downing of the jet , which he called " sickening . " " we need to wait to make any definitive statements until we know exactly what happened , but it was sickening and i hope they will know and i hope they will know soon , " he said . since leaving office , @entity1 started the @entity1 hiv / aids initiative ( now called the @entity107 ) in an effort to get treatment to hiv / aids patients in the developing world . the initiative has brought access to hiv / aids treatment to 8.2 million people since it was founded in 2002 , according to the @entity117 . " i like it because it 's personal flesh and blood , " he says of his second career in public service through his foundation . " you 're not just talking in abstract policy terms . you actually see the lives of people change . ... i loved my life in politics . i loved it . but the difference now is i can see the personal human implications of the decisions we are making and i can work on , you know , how do we get the right policy ? how do we make it work ? and then you see the results . " @entity1 touched on a number of other issues in the wide - ranging interview , among them : aid for migrant children a good step president @entity149 's pitch to @entity150 for billions of dollars to handle the cases of tens of thousands of children from @entity153 who are illegally crossing the border is a step in the right direction , @entity1 said . " i hope that he will get this money he has asked for , because some of these kids may be eligible to stay under our laws because of the circumstances they face back home , " @entity1 said . " and we do n't want to deny the ones who are eligible the right to stay even as we send the other ones back . " since october , officials say more than 57,500 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended at the southwest @entity15 border . the @entity149 administration has labeled the situation a humanitarian crisis , and has asked for emergency funding to deal with it . " the system he has proposed to put in place , if he gets the money for it , will give all the ones who are n't immediately sent back ... quicker hearings , so if they are entitled to stay , they can stay , " @entity1 said . @entity75 wants independence , not war with @entity187 " the @entity75 do n't really want a hostile relationship with @entity187 . ... what they want is to be independent , " @entity1 said of the political conflict between @entity75 and @entity187 . tensions have been high between @entity75 and @entity187 since street protests forced former @entity195 president @entity194 from power in february . @entity187 subsequently annexed @entity75 's southeastern @entity198 region , and a @entity200 separatist rebellion has been raging in @entity75 's eastern @entity202 and @entity203 regions . @entity75 wants " to be a bridge to @entity205 , between @entity205 and @entity187 . and if done properly it would be good for @entity75 but also be very good for @entity187 and good for @entity205 . so we have a clash there about what the @entity210 ought to be like . is it important for all of us to divide up and hide behind our walls ? or can we find a way to work together ? " @entity15 should help @entity215 , which needs to help itself " i would n't rule out the @entity15 doing more in @entity215 if the @entity215 do what 's necessary to help themselves , " @entity1 said of the worsening humanitarian situation in the country . the violent militant group @entity222 in @entity215 and @entity223 has taken over large swaths of land in @entity215 and aims to establish a hardline @entity227 state . at least 2,400 @entity215 died in violence in june , according to the @entity229 . of those , the @entity229 said more than 1,500 were civilians . " we have got to be helping an entity committed to inclusive government for the next 20 or 30 years -- people who do n't want the forces of destruction to prevail are going to have to prove they can do inclusive government and inclusive economics , " @entity1 said . settle @entity240 's territorial claims internationally @entity240 's territorial claims over nearby bodies of water have caused tensions to escalate with neighboring countries . conflict between @entity67 and @entity240 flared in may when a @entity240 oil corporation moved a drilling rig to an area claimed by both countries in the @entity251 . and last november , @entity240 declared an air defense identification zone over the @entity253 , imposing air traffic restrictions over an area disputed with @entity256 . @entity240 's moves have made other @entity259 countries nervous over its expanding military and more assertive foreign policy . and @entity1 says the @entity15 has a different take than @entity240 on how to solve the disputes .

@placeholder was a doctoral student in neuroscience	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 , the suspect in friday 's shooting of dozens of people at a @entity1 movie theater , was a " nice guy " who worked well with children , said a man who worked with him at a summer camp four years ago .

" he was a little isolated , but he was , you know , a nice guy , " @entity12 told @entity2 's @entity16 on monday . he could n't believe it when he realized his former co-worker was the suspect in the shootings . " once i saw it was him , i was shocked . ... something made him do a big change like that . i had no idea that later on he would be a murderer , a killer , " @entity12 said . @entity3 is due in court monday , where he is likely to face charges of first - degree murder in connection with the shootings that left 12 dead and 58 injured . @entity3 , a 24 - year - old doctoral student in neuroscience , was arrested outside the @entity39 multiplex early friday . he 's accused of opening fire in the crowded theater during a midnight screening of the new @entity44 movie , " @entity45 . " @entity3 was not involved in any incidents at the summer camp , @entity12 said . camp @entity48 caters to needy children ages 7 to 14 , and is run by @entity52 @entity51 of @entity53 , which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment . " it 's a big responsibility to work in a camp like that , and he was living up to it . he was pretty good , " said @entity12 , who did not stay in touch with @entity3 after they worked together four years ago . @entity3 applied to join a gun range in june , but the range 's operator said sunday that he was disturbed by the " weird and bizarre " message on @entity3 ' answering machine . " it was weird , " said @entity68 , managing partner of the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity1 . " i did n't know what kind of message was left by this idiot . we need to know if he 's an idiot before we let him have access to our range . " @entity68 told @entity2 that @entity3 sent in an online application on june 25 . @entity68 said he called the number @entity3 left on the form , only to get a message he said was largely unintelligible . he said the voice was " guttural , freakish , maybe drunk . just weird and bizarre -- a deep , guttural , forced voice . " paying tribute to the victims @entity68 said @entity3 did n't call him back . he left another message , and said he was again disturbed by the voice on the machine . " it bothered me so much i told my staff , ' if this guy shows up , he gets nothing until i meet him , ' " he said . he said he tried calling @entity95 a third time , again with no response , then quit . @entity3 never called back , nor did he come to the range in @entity70 , about 40 miles east of @entity99 . but when news broke friday of the bloodbath in a theater in the @entity99 suburb of @entity0 , @entity68 said one of his staffers remembered the name and saw that it matched reports of the suspect in the killings . shooting survivors recount @entity1 horror pictures obtained of @entity3 show a tall , bright - eyed , dark - haired young man , in contrast to the man a law enforcement official said had dyed his hair red and identified himself as " @entity119 " after his arrest . and authorities recovered a @entity44 poster and mask from his apartment , a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said sunday . it 's an image difficult to reconcile for those who know him as a clean - cut , quiet graduate student . he entered the @entity132 , in 2006 on a scholarship and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor 's degree in neuroscience in 2010 . " academically , he was at the top of the top , " chancellor @entity137 said . @entity132 police have no record of any contact with @entity3 , the university said . neither did police at the @entity147 , where @entity3 enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the @entity151 in @entity0 , university officials said in a statement released sunday . @entity3 ' sole brush with the law in @entity1 appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from @entity0 police . but there are indications that something may have been amiss in @entity3 ' life in recent months . he withdrew from the program in june , though " he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school , " said @entity166 , a spokeswoman for the @entity147 . he received many deliveries over the past four months to his home and work addresses , which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and found in his booby - trapped apartment , @entity0 police chief @entity175 told reporters saturday . @entity3 purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months , @entity177 said . police : evidence of ' calculation , ' ' deliberation ' in @entity1 shooting police have n't disclosed any motive for the attack or explained @entity3 ' appearance at the time of his arrest , citing an ongoing investigation . @entity3 was dressed in black , wearing a ballistic helmet , a tactical ballistic vest , protective leggings , a throat and groin protector , and a gas mask during the attack , police said , and witnesses say they did not see his face because of the mask . unlike most people his age , @entity3 does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no accounts with @entity209 , @entity210 or @entity211 , though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on the sex website @entity214 . the profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair , a law enforcement source said . police believe it may be a picture of @entity3 , said the source , who was not authorized to speak to the media . the profile said it was created by a 24 - year - old man from @entity0 and has since been taken down . @entity214 said sunday that it " values the privacy of its members " and would not confirm the identity of any users . the site will respond to police inquiries " as may be required by law , " company spokesman @entity231 said in a written statement . the man who grew up in the upscale northwest @entity238 neighborhood of @entity239 was renting an apartment in @entity0 , according to police and realty records . @entity243 , a neighbor of the @entity3 family in @entity238 , described @entity3 as " clean - cut , quiet , responsible .

experiments at @entity97 in @placeholder aim to create fusion power by 2030	@entity96	( @entity0 ) -- until recently , fears of peak oil and dependence on @entity5 suppliers were the key factors shaping our energy policy , pushing governments to scramble for fossil fuel alternatives . then came shale gas , tar sands , and other unconventional sources . industry found ways to affordably extract fuel for decades to come . so many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis . that 's a dangerous mistake . first , even the most optimistic predictions leave our grandchildren exposed to an uncertain future . more immediately -- and maybe more importantly -- burning fossil fuels is the number one cause of global warming and its catastrophic consequences . we need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited . there are few viable options that will preserve the levels of prosperity that modern industrial economies have come to expect . solar , advanced nuclear fission , and fusion offer the best hope but , unfortunately , none are ready for large - scale deployment . all need time - consuming innovations so we can not afford to hesitate ; research must be ramped up across the board and government must keep up the pace . of our three most promising technologies , fusion would be the biggest prize . it is in many respects the perfect energy source . sea water provides millions of years of fusion fuel . fusion reactions are safe , they emit neither radioactive waste nor greenhouse gasses and fusion reactors would take up relatively little space . the catch is fusion is very hard to do . two isotopes of hydrogen ( deuterium and tritium ) must be held at 200 - million degrees until they collide and fuse to make helium . it is not easy to build a device that runs at ten times the temperature of the @entity70 , but it is possible . in fact , the @entity73 experimental facility , @entity74 -- hosted in the @entity75 , has already done it . for a couple of seconds , it generated 16 megawatts of fusion power -- enough to supply around 8,000 homes . this is an astonishing achievement . we must now extend that duration and power and innovate technologies to make fusion electricity at a price that the consumer will pay . we 're working flat out on the first of those goals . seven international partners representing more than half the world 's people are constructing the critical experiment right now in @entity96 . called @entity97 -- it is designed to reach a self - sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power . construction will complete in 2020 with a fusion burn expected by 2030 . there are other approaches to fusion -- for example the laser experiments at the @entity108 in @entity109 -- but for many of us in the scientific trenches , the fusion burn on @entity97 is expected to be the defining moment . but what about our second objective of economic viability ? @entity97 is n't meant to achieve that goal . in addition to clearing our last remaining scientific hurdle , we need to advance a parallel engineering agenda into key reactor technologies that will enable commercial fusion power plants to reliably deliver electricity in a highly competitive market . this means technological advances in areas such as structural and functional materials , power conversion , and reliability . @entity133 and @entity134 are on the job but the @entity136 and @entity73 are reluctant to face the engineering issues . certainly , cost increases on @entity97 have n't helped . if we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds , however , we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to @entity133 and @entity134 . it goes without saying that resources are limited in our recession - ravaged economies ... but disinvesting in seed corn is obviously self - defeating . what can we afford ? the world energy market is approximately € 5 - € 10 trillion ( $ 6.5 - 13 trillion ) a year . the total world spend on energy research is about 0.5 % of this -- strikingly low . fusion research including @entity97 construction is less than € 1.5 billion ( $ 2 billion ) a year -- not even 0.05 % of the market . we are , it seems , not taking the threat of climate change and energy shortages seriously . in this context , the roughly € 200 - 500 million ( $ 260 - 650 million ) per year needed to vigorously pursue the parallel track of technology innovation in fusion seems absurdly small . we often hear that @entity164 ' dire predictions about population growth were wrong because humans innovated solutions to food shortages . will we innovate ourselves out of our long - term energy constraints too ? only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .	@entity75:UK	@entity173:Steven Cowley	@entity0:CNN	@entity164:Thomas Malthus	@entity5:Middle Eastern	@entity73:Europe	@entity70:Sun	@entity97:ITER	@entity74:JET	@entity109:California	@entity108:National Ignition Facility	@entity134:Korea	@entity136:U.S.	@entity96:France	@entity133:China
@entity15 attacked an army camp in @placeholder in october , killing at least 31 @entity13 soldiers	@entity6	a vehicle explodes . two trucks full of armed men race closer to the resulting crater at the @entity5 army camp in @entity6 . the black - clad militants chase the survivors , killing all the soldiers . all of it is captured on video . at least 31 @entity13 soldiers were killed in the october attack , the deadliest to date committed by the @entity6 - based militant group @entity15 ( champions of @entity17 ) . @entity15 militants released video of the ambush in mid-november -- just days after pledging allegiance to @entity22 , the @entity23 terror group that now controls large parts of @entity25 and @entity26 . the footage , which also shows a number of drive - by shootings and roadside bomb blasts , suggests that the group 's firepower and strategic planning is becoming more sophisticated . @entity15 operates primarily in @entity34 , an area where rolling sand dunes butt up against the @entity36 and stretch to rocky mountains in the center of the @entity39 . for years this corner has been dubbed " the most dangerous part of @entity13 . " since 2011 , the group has been attacking @entity44 interests in @entity6 by repeatedly blowing up a gas pipeline leading from the @entity13 @entity46 to @entity44 . the group stepped up the frequency of its raids after @entity13 's army overthrew president @entity50 -- a former @entity51 leader -- following a popular uprising in july 2013 . hundreds of @entity13 troops have since been slaughtered in this low - level insurgency . in the two months leading up to the october 24 massacre at @entity5 , the group more than doubled its attacks in @entity6 -- killing 62 police officers and soldiers , according to @entity59 , an @entity13 @entity61 affiliate . while looting weapons from @entity5 , a militant proclaimed to the camera : " tell the leader of @entity22 , [ @entity64 ] @entity65 , the leader of the faithful , that you are coming here and we are your soldiers . " the group has changed its logo and its name to @entity73 -- " the @entity74 " -- positioning itself as part of the bigger @entity22 " caliphate " that extends from northern @entity25 to central @entity26 . several other militant groups from the region have also pledged allegiance to @entity22 , including in @entity80 , which shares a long porous border with @entity13 that is known for being an arms - smuggling route . these pledges benefit @entity22 , whose territorial expansions have already peaked and are now stagnant , explains @entity86 , from the @entity87 at @entity88 . " it may well be very possible that @entity15 decided that in order for it to maintain its own type of momentum , to become part of a broader transnational group , would be in its own interest , " @entity86 told @entity90 . observers note the scarcity of verified information coming from @entity6 ; the military limits access to the wild terrain believed to be the group 's home and the surrounding towns and villages . most concerns about @entity15 's recent pledge of allegiance to @entity22 are focused on the possible increase in recruitment and expertise . " first thing it means is that any @entity13 currently fighting with @entity22 and @entity115 in @entity25 or @entity26 have a second arena to go and fight in without leaving the group , " @entity86 said . " they 'll add that expertise , they 'll add that training to the capacity of [ @entity15 ] . " unlike @entity22 , @entity15 mostly refrains from targeting civilians . the group has almost exclusively attacked the government , aside from one recent @entity15 video purporting to show the beheading of four civilian men who were accused of spying for @entity44 . in a video claiming responsibility for the attempted assassination in 2013 of @entity13 's minister of interior , @entity15 said it chose the site of the suicide bombing to minimize @entity51 civilian casualties . it pits itself as a defender of the people against what it calls the " apostate " army . its statements often cite videos of @entity13 's army attacking protesters in 2011 , the killing of more than one thousand @entity50 supporters in august 2013 and , most recently , a leaked video of @entity13 soldiers torturing two @entity148 . @entity15 also cites pictures of militants killed by security forces in @entity6 as further proof of abuses . " you all saw what [ security forces ] did to @entity157 in @entity13 and in all squares . this army has crossed all lines . this army did what the @entity164 did n't do with his people , " warns an unidentifiable militant in one @entity15 video . " we will kill you all , you apostates . " sitting in front of a cache of weapons supposedly taken from the @entity5 camp , @entity15 's presumed leader said he would free the " prisoners of war " held by authorities . " we told you before , the war has n't started yet . and what 's coming is worse and bitter . this is only the beginning . you opened a door you wo n't be able to close , " he said , clad in black clothing with his face blurred . following the october attack , the government ordered the evacuation of houses along the @entity13 - @entity187 border , creating a one - kilometer - wide buffer zone , in a bid to curtail smuggling of arms through the @entity187 tunnels . in a video showcasing its capabilities under the banner of " a fierce military operation to purge @entity39 from the grip of terrorism and criminals " , @entity13 's army also included interviews with evacuees assuring the public that they did so willingly and received proper compensations . the residents of northern @entity6 have long complained of being neglected by @entity207 . the lack of job opportunities and development -- along with a general mistrust between @entity213 peoples and the government -- has created fertile ground for the rise of @entity15 . " this is collective punishment by the army and the police , " said @entity217 , a counter-terrorism researcher at the @entity219 . " the army has been destroying houses of the people and burning their cars and motorcycles for the past two years . " terrorist attacks have only increased as the government has stepped up operations since july 2013 , observed @entity217 , who argues that the that the narrow focus on security is counterproductive and is only making the situation worse . " it 's very complicated . it has a lot of dimensions , economic and political . we are dealing with a regime that since july 2013 has been saying ' it 's me and only me , no parliament or elections , ' " said @entity217 . opening the public sphere for competing viewpoints , he argued , would help curb terrorism . but defeating @entity15 will take more than establishing security . @entity217 says the government first needs to improve the lives of the civilians in the area . in the meantime , @entity15 is no longer confined to @entity6 . it has launched attacks in the @entity253 , in @entity207 , and against @entity44 -- the group 's original enemy . in @entity207 , observers worry that the heavy hand of security services in cracking down on dissent is fueling the violence . it provides grounds for recruitment for groups like @entity15 and is reflected in the spike in number of improvised explosive devices ( @entity267 ) defused or detonated in the @entity268 . @entity15 has only claimed responsibility for a few of these attacks . but despite the rise in number and sophistication of attacks , @entity217 believes @entity13 is safe for tourists and civilians -- at least for now . " now , @entity15 is not targeting civilians , " he told @entity90 . " but if it gets worse and they do n't see hope , then maybe . " the government sees the threat within a regional context . @entity13 president @entity285 has expressed support for the global war on @entity22 . and at home , he remains resolute . " they assume that we are incapable of confronting them . they started the fire . we were very careful that no blood is shed . but unfortunately , they wanted the exact opposite , " the former defense minister , elected president last summer , said 10 days after the october attack . @entity285 said he was n't shaken by the attack -- and refused to direct his anger at military leadership , as some voices critical of security failures have called for . he ridiculed @entity15 's attempts to create an " emirate " out of @entity6 , pledging that no one would crack the enduring unity of @entity13 . it 's impossible for @entity15 to eliminate the @entity311 world 's largest military . yet until there is a victor , the death toll will continue to rise . as the group declared in one video , it seems more determined than ever to expand : " we will eliminate borders . no passports , no visas and no borders . it 's not just about @entity6 .

he says @placeholder mainly sells hardware , which does n't run into censorship problems	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 ceo @entity1 expects @entity3 , the world 's most populous country , to become the no. 1 market for the company . equally heavyweight tech companies @entity7 or @entity8 can only watch with envy . it is not because of lack of effort that they are nowhere near the success of @entity2 in @entity3 . their businesses are just too different . the @entity3 government 's tight control on freedom of information flow applies especially to the @entity22 . web access is filtered on a regular basis . social media websites such as @entity8 and @entity26 are blocked because the government deems them as potential hot spots for facilitating politically sensitive or socially inappropriate content . meanwhile , @entity7 is operational in @entity3 but has to route all searches to its @entity32 site , and the access is often interrupted . so , it is fair to say that the @entity3 government is the reason why companies such as @entity7 and @entity8 are not doing well in @entity3 . in contrast , @entity2 mainly sells hardware , so it has not run into any censorship problems . @entity3 consumers love electronic gadgets . mobile phones are ubiquitous . @entity2 is doing incredibly well because its products are so much more attractive and pricy . the @entity45 quickly become a status symbol product in @entity3 social circles since its debut . likewise , the @entity49 also joined the must - have list as soon as it was launched . if someone wants to lubricate his " guanxi " -- relationship -- with an important person , these two products are often the gift of choice . before the @entity49 reached @entity3 , a businessman in @entity60 told me that in the back of his car trunk , he had stocked at least 20 @entity49 , all bought in @entity32 . " it is the most - loved present for government officials , " he claimed . the social pressure of having an @entity2 product is strong , especially as the wealthy elites set the trend . if a middle class @entity3 consumer can not afford an expensive car or watch , sporting an @entity45 may be just as good . even the bad press surrounding @entity76 , the main manufacturer of @entity2 products , did not make too much of a dent on the company 's sales . there is no doubt that @entity3 will be an important market for @entity2 in the coming years . among the three main telecommunications companies in the country , @entity84 is the only one without @entity2 's @entity45 support despite the fact that it is the largest operator with nearly 700 million subscribers . many high - end @entity84 customers still stay in @entity93 because @entity84 's @entity94 does not have iphones . if @entity84 gets its own version of @entity45 , as rumor has it recently , then it would be a shot in the arm for @entity2 . interestingly enough , @entity2 's growth in @entity3 is all from its hardware . its @entity107 store sales from music , videos , books or apps downloads are almost negligible . this has nothing to do with the government . there is no censorship of @entity107 other than @entity2 's own self - screening mechanism . poor sales from @entity117 owe more to the fact that the @entity3 are habitually reluctant to pay for intellectual properties . to make things worse , there are so many websites that offer " jailbreak " tips so that people can easily bypass @entity2 and get free downloads elsewhere . there are rumors that @entity2 might consider adding a cheaper version of the @entity45 for the @entity3 market . in light of the fast growing smartphone market , cheaper phones seem to make sense especially since there are still millions of @entity3 who can not afford a pricy iphone of 5000 yuan ( roughly $ 800 dollars ) . but @entity2 should stay away from the idea . it does not make sense to sacrifice profit margin just for a greater market share . doing so would tarnish the premium image of @entity2 and erode the love and loyalty of the elites . one lesson that @entity2 can learn is that not long ago , @entity148 used to own the @entity3 market but it became so popular that it lost its appeal to the elites . @entity148 ended up trying a new brand , @entity152 , to entice consumers , but it was not very successful . by building more retail stores in @entity3 , @entity2 would certainly accelerate its growth . but the challenge is to maintain its prestige so that consumers would not lose interest and crave for a new elite brand . @entity2 might also want to rethink its @entity117 business model in @entity3 so that it can generate sales in other ways . hardware comes and goes . one day , @entity2 products can and will be replaced . but demand for books , movies , music , and apps is ongoing . will @entity2 find a way to tap into the @entity3 consumption for content ? we 'll just have to see . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .	@entity3:China	@entity2:Apple	@entity1:Tim Cook	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Google	@entity177:Chiang	@entity8:Facebook	@entity148:Nokia	@entity22:Internet	@entity117:iTunes Store	@entity45:iPhone	@entity76:Foxconn	@entity32:Hong Kong	@entity84:China Mobile	@entity107:iTunes	@entity152:Vertu	@entity94:3G network	@entity26:Twitter	@entity93:2G network	@entity49:iPads	@entity60:Shanghai
@entity1 , 39 , parred the last two holes to clinch his third @placeholder title	@entity35	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 overcame a final - round charge from fellow @entity4 golfer @entity3 to win the @entity5 by one shot in @entity7 on sunday . @entity1 went one better than his second - placed finish at the @entity9 last weekend . @entity10 had resumed play in 20th place six shots adrift of third - round leader @entity1 , but surged up the leaderboard with a sensational 10 - under - par 62 to set the clubhouse lead on 12 - under 276 . the 35 - year - old , who was third at @entity17 two years ago after a closing 66 , birdied seven successive holes from six to 12 . he had already picked up shots at two of his opening four greens , then also birdied 17 . @entity1 , however , kept his nerve as he went one better than last weekend , when he lost the @entity23 @entity9 in a play - off with @entity26 's @entity25 -- the fourth time out of four he has been beaten in sudden death . the 39 - year - old started birdie - bogey - birdie , then rattled off four successive birdies before dropping a shot at the 15th hole . however , he immediately bounced back with a birdie at the par - five 16th and parred the last two to take victory , his third on the @entity35 following wins in @entity37 and @entity38 . he carded a five - under 67 to follow up successive rounds of 68 as he denied world @entity40 a maiden title on the circuit . @entity10 is becoming noted as a strong finisher , having closed with a course - record 63 at the @entity9 , where he tied for 15th . defending champion @entity47 of @entity48 closed with 67 to share third place on 278 with former @entity51 @entity9 champion @entity50 , who carded 69 after starting the day one shot adrift of @entity1 in second . the @entity54 had led the tournament for the first two rounds , in which he did not drop a stroke . his final round featured an eagle on the par - five ninth hole , which followed two birdies , but his title challenge faded with bogeys at 12 and 15 . @entity50 's compatriot @entity64 was fourth on nine - under 279 following a fine 64 , which featured 10 birdies and a double - bogey at the par - four fifth hole .	@entity23:Dutch	@entity26:England	@entity25:Simon Dyson	@entity3:Martin Erlandsson	@entity1:Hedblom	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Scotland	@entity5:Johnnie Walker Championship	@entity4:Swede	@entity9:Open	@entity51:British	@entity50:Lawrie	@entity54:Scot	@entity17:Gleneagles	@entity35:European Tour	@entity37:Malaysia	@entity10:Erlandsson	@entity38:Morocco	@entity47:Gregory Havret	@entity40:No. 365 Erlandsson	@entity64:Gary Orr	@entity48:France
the @placeholder is launching a new initiative to attract women	@entity0	the @entity0 is waging a battle . they want to take back the @entity3 in the 2014 midterms and maintain their majority in the @entity6 . and one political front is with women . in recent years the @entity0 has enjoyed a political advantage with women as more of them have voted for @entity0 . the @entity11 admits errors leading to success of female @entity0 . for instance , in the last election , @entity11 candidates , including @entity6 candidate @entity15 , marginalized women by espousing controversial opinions on rape and abortion . the situation was so crippling that @entity11 leaders conducted an " autopsy " after the 2012 election to evaluate the party 's shortcomings . the image of the white man is something the @entity11 is having trouble breaking . voters were reminded of the patrician perception just a couple of weeks ago during the government shutdown when @entity3 @entity11 leaders let the press in a meeting to take pictures as they worked . at the long table sat eight men in their shirtsleeves . not one woman was present . those examples of images and statements make a difference at the voting booth . @entity11 presidential candidate @entity48 's nine - point loss among women to president @entity50 . additionally , of the 81 women members of @entity52 , only 19 are @entity11 . the story is similar in the @entity6 . but the @entity0 are n't taking any chances . they do n't want to lose their electoral advantage . last year , they attacked the @entity11 ' anti-choice , @entity59 and anti-higher minimum wage policies as a " war on women . " this year they are launching a war with women . rep. @entity64 of @entity65 , who chairs the @entity66 , on friday unveiled the @entity67 , a new initiative to " target , motivate and mobilize women " to vote and run for office . and they are throwing money , resources and staff at the effort . they will conduct polls and gather data directed at women voters , find the forgotten women voters and train women to become involved or run for office . it was rolled out at the 20th anniversary of the @entity66 's @entity84 where @entity86 @entity85 spoke as did @entity87 , president of @entity88 . republicans are " trying to reach out to women , " @entity64 said in a hotel ballroom full of women activists . " is n't that adorable ? " she smirked . " outreach is inserting themselves into the most private decisions women make , " she added . @entity64 's entire message was n't about beating the @entity11 . she said that when women sit at the table , they bring solutions . " we understand the role of compromise . when we 're at the table , government is more responsible , " @entity64 told the audience , referring to the latest gridlock in @entity101 that partially shut down the government . " even with @entity105 involved , we could 've struck an agreement , " the @entity65 congresswoman said . the return of @entity105 her goals , however , are still specific : enroll more women into the @entity0 . @entity11 admit that they have some work to do . " we hurt ourselves , " @entity111 spokes woman @entity112 told @entity113 .

chances of winning are one in 175.2 million , according to @placeholder	@entity14	six numbers have the power to change your life . maybe your kid is sick and there are hospital bills to pay . maybe you 've lost your job and you 're worried about making rent . maybe you still have a job , but it sucks , and you 'd really like to spend the next 50 years lying on a beach with a mai tai in hand . whatever your predicament , the current estimated @entity14 jackpot of $ 600 million could fix it . which makes us wonder -- when it comes to playing the lottery , are we all just damsels in distress ? " because we 're in a recession , people love to have a rescue fantasy , " human behavior expert dr. @entity22 told @entity24 last year when the @entity26 jackpot hit $ 656 million . " we have the @entity31 complex -- there 's a fairy godmother who 's going to come in and save us . " we 've all heard the statistics . your chances of winning the @entity14 jackpot are about one in 175.2 million . you 're more likely to die from a bee sting ( one in 6.1 million ) , be struck by lightning ( one in 3 million ) or have conjoined twins ( one in 200,000 ) . but people keep playing -- most likely because the thought of winning $ 550 million is much more fun than the thought of being attacked by a shark ( one in 11.5 million ) . " it does n't faze them because they 're in love with hope , " @entity22 said . in 2010 , @entity56 lottery sales totaled $ 58 billion , according to the @entity57 of @entity58 and @entity59 . more than half of us have played the lottery in the last year , although 20 % of customers buy the majority of the tickets . winning brings major life change part of the allure is that everyone else is doing it , said dr. @entity72 , author of " @entity73 " and co-director of the @entity75 . in a @entity77 article titled " @entity78 ! " @entity72 noted two main reasons why people buy tickets . " jumping on the bandwagon is an age - old motivator of psychological behavior , " wrote @entity72 and his colleague , @entity82 . " we want to be with the in - crowd , to be ' part of the movement , ' not ' feel left out . ' " the second reason stems from a sense of disempowerment that comes with change -- whether it 's a changing economy or a changing world . " the map to finding the @entity97 has been radically altered , " they wrote . " ( the lottery ) lets you believe in magic : that you will be the one who spent a little and got a lot ; that you will defy the extraordinary odds against winning . " @entity104 fights to ban @entity106 lottery spend a little , get a lot -- the basis for every good investment . the low cost of a lottery ticket is one of the most seductive things about it . the lottery industry is often criticized for being an unfair tax on the poor . on average , households that make less than $ 12,400 a year spend 5 % of their income on lotteries , according to @entity122 . in 2008 , researchers at @entity124 attempted to explain why the poor are more likely to buy lottery tickets . the study , published in the @entity128 , theorized that people focus on the cost - to - benefit ratio of a single ticket rather than add up the long - term cost of playing over a year , or a lifetime . some study participants were given $ 1 at a time and asked if they wanted to spend each dollar on a lottery ticket , author @entity134 said . others were given $ 5 and asked how many tickets they wanted to buy with the money . members of a third group were told they could either spend $ 5 on lottery tickets or buy none at all . @entity146 : how to buy happiness people in the second group bought half as many as those given $ 1 at a time . in the all - or - nothing scenario , 87 % of the study participants purchased zero tickets . the researchers ' findings were consistent with something known as the " peanuts effect . " " there are money amounts that are small enough that people almost ignore them , " @entity134 said wednesday . " it almost does n't feel real . the lottery and penny slots are kind of the sweet spot of risk taking . they 're really cheap , really inexpensive to play , but there 's a big possible upside . " still , to say that playing the lottery is a bad idea does n't sit well with the professor of economics and psychology . " it 's ridiculous to say that 51 % of the population is just irrational or self - destructive , " he said . " it serves a psychological function for people . ... our pleasure of living is not only based on our current situation , but what could be , what we can imagine our situation could become . " irrational or not , millions will sit around their tv and computer screens wednesday night , praying that the six numbers they 're clutching will appear . they 're optimistic that the fairy - tale ending they 've been waiting for will come , even if it takes a little magic . does winning the lottery guarantee happiness ?	@entity22:Walsh	@entity26:Mega Millions	@entity106:Texas	@entity24:CNN	@entity82:Joan DiFuria	@entity134:Loewenstein	@entity57:North American Association	@entity78:Lottery-itis	@entity75:Money , Meaning & Choices Institute	@entity77:Psychology Today	@entity58:State	@entity73:Affluence Intelligence	@entity56:U.S.	@entity31:Cinderella	@entity14:Powerball	@entity104:NAACP	@entity128:Journal of Behavioral Decision Making	@entity97:American Dream	@entity124:Carnegie Mellon University	@entity122:Wired	@entity59:Provincial Lotteries	@entity146:Ted Talks	@entity72:Goldbart

@entity250 : while @placeholder focuses on withdrawal , much remains at stake for @entity4 women	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- " the @entity5 joins the government of @entity4 in strongly condemning the murder of @entity8 , who was killed in a drive - by shooting monday morning , " read a press release issued december 12 by the @entity2 and distributed by the @entity3 in @entity4 . " the @entity5 will continue to stand side - by - side with women who are carrying on @entity8 's fight , the @entity4 government and all @entity4 people to ensure that the hard - won gains made by women in the recent years are protected and advanced . " yet as the 2014 deadline for withdrawal of @entity20 forces approaches many @entity4 and some @entity5 wonder how , exactly , those gains will be safeguarded . and @entity8 's death , along with three other killings of @entity4 women in the past several weeks , shows both the gains and potential losses facing women in @entity4 . on a recent monday morning , gunmen opened fire on @entity8 while she walked to her office in broad daylight in eastern @entity32 . she was the acting head of the region 's women 's affairs department , which meant that she handled everything from helping abused women get to shelters to overseeing regional economic empowerment programs . her title was " acting " because , as @entity4 's @entity42 reported , only five months earlier her predecessor , @entity41 , was killed in a car bomb blast that also left her husband in a coma . both @entity8 and @entity41 are among the hundreds of @entity4 officials and leaders who have been targeted for assassination . the killings of the @entity4 officials come alongside several weeks in which horrific cases of violence against women came to light in the @entity4 press . in @entity59 province , a 16 - year - old schoolgirl named @entity57 was shot dead after leaving the @entity60 . days later @entity4 women leaders gathered in @entity62 to demand justice and a government investigation into whether the @entity65 , which are suspected in the killing , were responsible . some activists saw a link between @entity57 's killing and her work volunteering for a polio eradication campaign the @entity65 are known to oppose . in @entity73 province , 2012 has been the " most violent on record for women and girls , " with more than a dozen killed . most recently , a 14 - year - old was killed by a gunman as she opened her door , allegedly in connection to a failed marriage proposal . another schoolgirl , @entity82 , was found slain , her throat slit in what appeared to be retribution for her father 's refusal to agree to her marriage . the girl 's killing came while she was on her way to collect water for her home near the @entity96 border . one of the men the police detained in the investigation was her thwarted suitor . this collage of horrific violence against women tells two stories . first , for @entity4 officials , death is a frighteningly present possibility at all times , and women serving other women are among the leading targets . a slew of high - profile female leaders have been killed , from @entity115 of @entity117 's police force to @entity118 , who headed @entity117 's local ministry of women 's affairs office , the same position @entity41 and @entity8 held in @entity32 . and second , as a @entity122 official in @entity4 noted this month , while violence against women remains " largely under - reported due to cultural restraints , social norms and taboos , " the last year saw " an actual increase in reporting of incidents of violence against women , " with prosecutors and courts " convicting more perpetrators for such crimes . " certainly the high - visibility horrors that " reach law enforcement , that actually get to the court , or receive public attention due to their egregious nature represent only the tip of the iceberg " when it comes to crimes against women in @entity4 , but the fact is that more women are bringing their abuse to the authorities and a thriving @entity4 media are picking up their stories . this reality points to progress , say advocates for women . and they say they are coming to believe that these steps forward will not recede as the international troops withdraw . " i do n't see that @entity4 can go backwards , " says @entity159 of @entity160 , an organization that runs shelters for abused women across the country . " too many people have experienced and felt the freedom of how it is to live in a safe environment . i really do n't think the young people will ever go backwards . " certainly the years since 2001 have been marked by dramatic changes for @entity4 women . nearly 3 million girls are in school , and more than 3,000 midwives across the country save expectant mothers ' lives . women make up a quarter of parliament , and civil society -- groups pushing for human rights and better education -- is filled with 20 - , 30 - and 40 - something women pushing for their rights and their country 's future . in many ways the stories of these women are part of a larger narrative the @entity5 public , exhausted by the country 's longest - ever war , has nearly stopped hearing : some women are making great progress -- and taking great risks -- while some others have seen their lives change little and continue to be plagued by violence and deadly abuse . their fates are linked . as three prominent @entity4 women entrepreneurs who appeared in @entity206 at the @entity207 this month made clear , the gains of some women lead to the gains of more . homegrown role models help show what is possible to the girls of the next generation -- and their fathers . in the political sphere they show that women can lead and they stand up for girls such as @entity82 . and in the economic realm these entrepreneurs are creating jobs for women and men in a country that has an unemployment rate estimated to top 35 % . as these women push forward they bring others with them and bolster families ' prospects in the process . but their advancement takes time . in @entity5 's recent election , neither side wanted to discuss in any depth either the stakes of the @entity4 conflict or a sustainable future strategy for the war . poll after poll shows @entity5 no longer think it is a war worth fighting . but @entity4 women are still in the fight and will be long after 2014 . and their battle for a more educated , richer , healthier country is one in which everyone has a stake . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .	@entity20:NATO	@entity117:Kandahar	@entity159:Manizha Naderi	@entity118:Safia Ama Jan	@entity3:U.S. Embassy	@entity2:U.S. State Department	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:U.S.	@entity4:Afghan	@entity207:U.S. Institute of Peace	@entity8:Sediqi	@entity57:Anisa	@entity59:Kapisa	@entity73:Kunduz	@entity32:Laghman	@entity60:Mahmoud Raqi Girls High School	@entity96:Tajikstan	@entity122:U.N.	@entity206:Washington	@entity250:Lemmon	@entity160:Women for Afghan Women	@entity115:Malalai Kakar	@entity41:Safi	@entity42:TOLO TV	@entity65:Taliban	@entity62:Kabul	@entity82:Giseena
@entity12 says @entity3 tried to make her play @placeholder roulette with a real gun	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- two months after a nationwide manhunt helped authorities track down kidnapped @entity4 teen @entity3 , she 's revealing new details about her conversations with the man who allegedly held her hostage and killed her mother and brother . in an interview with @entity15 's " today " show broadcast thursday morning , @entity12 described the moment she says she realized family friend @entity3 was kidnapping her in early august . he had just picked her up from cheerleading practice and took her to his home about an hour east of @entity20 -- apparently , she said she 'd eventually learn , with her mom and brother hidden somewhere inside . @entity12 says @entity3 sat her down on a couch , handcuffed her , zip - tied her feet and revealed his plan to kidnap her and drive her to @entity26 . the day quickly took an even darker turn , @entity12 said , when @entity3 encouraged her to play @entity29 roulette with him , using a real gun . " when it was my turn , i started crying and , like , was freaking out , " @entity12 said . " and he said , ' do you want to play ? ' and i said , ' no , ' and i started crying , and he 's like , ' ok , ' and he stopped . " @entity12 said @entity3 told her that her mother , @entity34 , 42 , and her brother @entity35 , 8 , were elsewhere in the house , alive . @entity12 , 16 , said that she could hear @entity35 . " i heard him trying to yell upstairs , but he was gagged , so i could n't do anything to help him , " @entity12 said . " i was yelling his name . i could n't do anything . " she said after about two to three hours , @entity3 drugged her -- with @entity41 , she thinks -- and when she woke up , she found herself in @entity26 with him . that 's when he told her , she said , that her mother and @entity35 still were in the house 's garage , and that he had set a timer that would ignite a fire at the home , many hours after @entity3 and @entity12 had left . @entity3 told her that he had left signs that would indicate to responding firefighters -- before the fire reached the garage -- where @entity34 and @entity35 were , @entity3 told " today . " authorities would eventually find the remains of @entity34 in the burned garage and @entity35 's body in another part of the home . @entity34 was struck at least 12 times in the head ; her right arm and both legs were fractured , and she had a cut on her neck , an autopsy revealed . the woman 's ankles were bound by a plastic cable tie , and duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth , her autopsy report said . @entity35 was burned beyond recognition . it was believed , according to the autopsy , that the boy died because of the fire . after evading authorities for a week , horseback riders spotted @entity3 and @entity3 in the @entity26 wilderness , nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred . @entity12 said @entity3 told her he 'd kill the riders if she spoke to them . @entity3 spoke to them , and they left , she said . but those riders , feeling something was amiss and learning that an @entity87 had been issued , contacted authorities . when law enforcement teams closed in on the two august 10 , @entity3 was shot dead by an @entity91 agent and @entity12 was taken to a hospital . recalling the moments before the shooting , @entity12 told " today " that she and @entity3 were by a fire , which she said he 'd set in an effort to signal for help . she did n't say why he was trying to signal for assistance . she said she told him that she 'd read in a book that firing a gun three times in the air also was a signal for help . so , she said , @entity12 fired a gun once in the air , and then a second time -- but with a lowered aim . " then a bunch of guns went off . i looked and he fell on the ground , " she said . " i kind of looked over , and i was like , ' are you ok ? ' and then a bunch of , like , the @entity91 people came out , telling me to get down . " @entity12 said she was told the next day , in the hospital , that her mother , her brother and @entity3 were dead . with tears , @entity12 said she greatly missed her mother and brother . " sometimes it 's like i wait for them to get home , and then they 're not there , " she said . the nationwide manhunt for @entity3 drew widespread attention and sparked intense speculation about the case . now , the author of a new book is criticizing the teen 's behavior and claiming there are inconsistencies in her story , @entity0 affiliate @entity130 reported . an @entity139 spokeswoman told @entity0 the family has no comment on the book . addressing letters between @entity12 and @entity3 that authorities found in his burned home , @entity12 told " today " that she had been writing to @entity3 , a family friend , because her mother and father had split up . " me and my mom really did n't get along a year ago , so when i was having problems with her and i would n't have really anyone to talk about it with , me and him , instead of talking face to face if we did n't have time ... we 'd just write letters back and forth , talking about , like , the situation and how to get through it , " she said . her father , @entity12 , told " today " that he and his daughter are working through the ordeal . " we 're getting help and talking with each other and trying to be strong ( and ) moving forward , " he said . @entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .	@entity3:DiMaggio	@entity160:Faith Karimi	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:Idaho	@entity12:Anderson	@entity4:California	@entity20:San Diego	@entity29:Russian	@entity15:NBC	@entity139:Anderson family	@entity41:Ambien	@entity87:Amber Alert	@entity35:Ethan	@entity130:KGTV	@entity91:FBI	@entity34:Christina Anderson
they say @placeholder has not implemented a security agreement among @entity9 @entity72 countries	@entity7	@entity0 , the @entity1 and @entity2 announced wednesday the withdrawal of their ambassadors from @entity6 because @entity7 had not implemented an agreement among @entity9 not to interfere in each others ' internal affairs . the three countries , which are all part of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) along with @entity6 , announced the unprecedented move in a joint statement . they said @entity14 members had signed a deal november 23 that included " a security agreement and a commitment to the principles that ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the @entity14 countries , either directly or indirectly , and not to support any activity that would threaten the security and stability of any of the @entity14 countries from organizations or individuals , including support for hostile media .

" therefore @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 regret to announce that they will take what they deem to be the appropriate steps to protect the security and stability of their nations by withdrawing their ambassadors from @entity6 . " tensions @entity6 expressed " regret and surprise " at the decision and said it would not reciprocate with the same move , a cabinet statement published on the state @entity55 said . it said it would remain committed to " preserving and protecting the security and stability " of the @entity14 countries . tensions between @entity6 and the rest of the @entity14 have increased in recent years . wednesday 's announcement is the clearest sign yet of a rift between @entity9 @entity72 nations and @entity6 , a perceived supporter of @entity75 groups such as the @entity76 in @entity77 and elsewhere in the @entity78 -- which are viewed with suspicion or outright hostility by some fellow @entity14 members . @entity6 denounced last year 's ouster of @entity77 's @entity75 president @entity82 , who hails from the @entity76 . the @entity14 , formed in 1981 , consists of @entity0 , @entity6 , @entity83 , @entity2 , the @entity1 and @entity84 .	@entity2:Bahrain	@entity1:UAE	@entity0:Saudia Arabia	@entity7:Doha	@entity6:Qatar	@entity37:Riyadh	@entity9:Gulf	@entity82:Mohamed Morsy	@entity14:GCC	@entity84:Oman	@entity78:Middle East	@entity55:Qatar News Agency	@entity75:Islamist	@entity77:Egypt	@entity76:Brotherhood	@entity83:Kuwait	@entity72:Arab
@placeholder denied findings , says it is investigating possible release of classified info	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told @entity0 that few flights were protected by air marshals . @entity9 war veteran @entity8 says a @entity11 investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to @entity0 . the @entity11 rejected as a " myth " @entity0 's report that less than 1 percent of the nation 's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals . now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to @entity0 and who encouraged other agents to do the same . a spokesman for the @entity11 confirmed the investigation . spokesman @entity24 said a @entity11 investigator is looking into the " possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties . " " as part of this ongoing investigation , several individuals , both current and former employees , have been contacted as is typical in any investigation , " he said in an e-mail to @entity0 . @entity0 spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals , pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report , which aired in march on " @entity41 360º . " repeatedly , the sources told @entity0 that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard . that amounts to less than 1 percent . " that number is absolutely wrong , " said @entity45 , the head of the agency . he was speaking earlier this year before @entity48 , which held hearings into the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) in the wake of @entity0 's reporting . @entity0 learned of the @entity11 investigation from a former federal air marshal and @entity9 war veteran , @entity8 . he was not connected to the original story . @entity8 said he was called by @entity11 investigator @entity57 a few days after he came back from the front lines of @entity9 . @entity8 said @entity57 grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in @entity9 . the e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service . the e-mail encouraged recipients to contact @entity0 correspondent @entity67 if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals , the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to @entity48 . read the e-mail » @entity0 only recently received a copy of the e-mail . @entity0 did not have it when the report aired in march . @entity8 said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals . @entity8 said @entity57 wanted to know who sent him the e-mail . nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information , @entity8 said , nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public . " i was petrified , " @entity8 said of @entity57 's phone call , explaining how he contacted @entity0 full of dismay that the @entity11 was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media . " in @entity9 , there were a lot of dangerous things , but never have i been so scared [ as ] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said i want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending . " @entity11 's @entity45 refused repeated requests to be interviewed by @entity0 . @entity57 did not return repeated calls or e-mails . in an e-mail , @entity11 spokesman @entity24 confirmed @entity57 's involvement , but denied that the @entity11 or the @entity50 had accessed anyone 's private e-mail accounts , via subpoena or otherwise . however , he added that " all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in @entity11 , including the @entity50 . " @entity24 did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last . with a few phone calls , @entity0 was able to find the author of the original e-mail . the author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the @entity11 . the marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years , his colleagues have been trying to alert @entity48 about continuing problems in the air marshal service . many have left , he said , because of low morale and complaints about management . a may 2008 report from the @entity138 said that the agency " currently experiences a 17 % voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale . " " @entity48 does n't want to hear it , " the marshal said . " they stick their heads in the sand . we tell them about the corruption . we give them examples and proof and i think they are scared of what they see . and they do n't want to deal with it . " the marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail . " the only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that @entity0 was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and mr. @entity67 's e-mail address , " he said . " that 's not sensitive security information . that 's freedom of speech . " he said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of @entity48 investigating the air marshal service . meanwhile , the air marshal service is undergoing a management change . shortly after @entity0 aired its first report , director @entity178 announced plans to retire . he has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of integrity officer . his successor is @entity185 , current deputy director , who , like @entity178 and @entity57 , is a former @entity186 employee . according to the @entity11 , @entity178 's job is to ensure that " disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization . " former air marshal @entity8 said he thinks the @entity11 should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees ' e-mails .

@entity3 president @placeholder signs @entity5 's @entity4 , paving way for major changes to way 27 - nation bloc is run	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 president @entity2 signed the @entity5 's @entity4 tuesday , he announced on his web site , paving the way for major changes to the way the 27 - nation bloc is run . the @entity3 constitutional court ruled hours earlier that the treaty did not conflict with the country 's constitution , a government spokesman said . " i respect the decision of the @entity19 , " @entity2 said in a written statement , though he added he " disagreed " with it and said the court 's analysis was " not neutral . " however , he concluded , " i signed the @entity4 at 3 p.m. ( 1400 gmt ) . " the @entity3 was the last @entity5 nation left to approve the treaty , which could effectively give the @entity5 a president and a foreign minister . @entity2 's signature means the treaty -- which would replace the @entity5 constitution and aims to streamline the workings of the @entity5 -- could come into force as early as december 1 . the @entity3 @entity34 's two chambers voted in favor of the treaty earlier this year . but in late september , 17 @entity3 senators asked the country 's @entity19 to examine whether some further parts of the treaty were compatible with the country 's constitution . the court ruled tuesday that they pose no conflict . @entity2 agreed friday to ratify the document if the court approved , after winning an exemption ensuring it would not allow ethnic germans forced out of the country after @entity49 to reclaim their former lands . " i consider this to be the best possible result and intend to raise no other objections to the ratification of the @entity4 , " @entity2 said thursday after gaining the exemption . voters in two countries had rejected the @entity5 constitution in 2005 . the @entity4 , in addition to streamlining @entity5 decision - making and creating an @entity5 council president and foreign minister , would introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the @entity64 , the union 's executive branch , and would change the voting weights of countries on certain issues . @entity70 prime minister @entity69 , whose country currently holds the rotating @entity5 presidency , said he welcomed the @entity3 court 's decision . " we are now very close to full ratification . " @entity69 said . " together with a signature in the @entity3 , the presidency will continue the completion of @entity4 preparations . " the @entity3 is n't the only @entity5 country to demand an exemption before ratifying the treaty . @entity84 recently won an opt - out over social issues including gay marriage ; @entity88 won assurances that @entity5 law would not prevail over its own legal system . the treaty would also give national parliaments veto power over some proposed changes to @entity5 policy . all member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted . @entity99 voters approved the treaty last month after previously rejecting it . the @entity5 had assured @entity99 that the treaty would not affect the country 's anti-abortion laws or its neutrality and that @entity99 would keep a @entity107 commissioner .	@entity3:Czech	@entity2:Vaclav Klaus	@entity0:CNN	@entity34:Parliament	@entity5:EU	@entity4:Lisbon Treaty	@entity69:Reinfeldt	@entity19:Constitutional Court	@entity49:World War II	@entity84:Poland	@entity99:Ireland	@entity107:European	@entity88:Britain	@entity64:EU Commission	@entity70:Swedish

" since they grew up with him , they just knew @entity4 was @entity4 , " said @entity17 , his mother . " they did n't think of him as weird or anything . " but when friends started to notice @entity4 was different , @entity17 was quick to explain to a group of 10 - year - olds why . " @entity4 has a social problem , not a mental problem , " she explained . " he 's very smart . he reads encyclopedias ... he just does n't know how to talk to people . " from then on , friends who visited the house always made an effort to interact with @entity4 , through a high - five or a simple " hello . " today , it 's unlikely @entity4 will be the first to say hello in a group setting , but interacting with people is easier for him than it once was . see how @entity4 copes every day » questioned about his childhood , his most elaborate response is " yeah " or " no. " but when the topic is the @entity7 , it 's hard to get him to stop talking about the latest statistics or his favorite player , @entity41 . asked how long he 's been a @entity7 fan , there was little hesitation : " all my life . " he 's come a long way since he was a child . then , just teaching @entity4 to talk was a challenge in itself , @entity17 said . " there was no eye contact , so i would hold his face in front of me , and say the word i wanted him to say . " @entity4 entered the first grade as a special education student . it was the first year special education was offered in his family 's hometown of @entity61 , @entity62 . he carried on with special education until the sixth grade , when he was mainstreamed , or put in classes with children without disabilities . explainer : understanding autism » for most of @entity4 's childhood , his mother had suspicions about his condition . " when he was little , i had watched a ' @entity77 ' show , and they had an autistic child on there . but he was very passive ; he sat in the corner and just hit things , " @entity17 said . " @entity4 was wild . he was the opposite , so i just assumed he could n't be autistic . but he had a lot of those mannerisms . " it was @entity4 's freshman year of high school when @entity17 and @entity90 learned what was wrong with their son . " there was a doctor in @entity96 that dealt a lot with hyperactive children , " @entity17 said . " he said , ' i 'm going to give you this sheet of paper ; these are all the symptoms of autism . ' " the list had 19 symptoms , and @entity17 was instructed to circle the ones her son had . she circled 17 . the diagnosis did n't change how @entity17 dealt with her first - born son . in fact , the doctor said she already was doing all the right things , working to socialize @entity4 . today , @entity4 , living with his parents , finds comfort in strict routine . he wakes each day at 5 a.m. to make himself breakfast and prepare for work . at 6 , @entity17 drives her son to @entity14 , where he 's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria . @entity120 is @entity4 's supervisor , and has worked with @entity4 almost since the beginning . " he 's very valuable to us at this department . he 's dependable , on time , no attendance problems , " said @entity120 . " we love @entity4 . " after work , at 2:30 p.m. , @entity4 rides with his mother to the @entity128 , where he works out for about three hours . then it 's back home , where he fixes himself dinner and spends hours online looking up @entity7 statistics , or reading a number of baseball - related books from his personal library . this cycle repeats on days @entity4 works at the hospital . on his days off , the schedule is equally strict , with little variation . he 'll still go to the @entity128 , and he 'll also make the occasional trip to the bookstore , adding to his collection of baseball - related literature . sudden changes to daily plans are still a challenge . " if he 's made his plans to do something tonight , " said @entity90 , " and we come and say , ' we 're going to get something to eat . do you want to go ? ' that upsets his plans for what he 's going to do that night . " physical contact is also difficult . " he does n't like to be touched , " @entity17 said .

the x-ray machine was voted the most significant scientific invention , in a poll by the @entity7 in @placeholder	@entity0	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the x-ray machine was wednesday named the most important scientific invention , in a poll marking the centenary of the @entity7 in @entity0 . almost 50,000 people voted in the museum or online on a shortlist of ten discoveries and inventions from past centuries in science , technology and engineering . the x-ray machine , which was discovered in 1895 and revolutionized how doctors detected disease and injury , struck a chord with most voters who singled it out for having made the greatest impact on the past , present and future . it gathered one fifth of the votes ( 9581 votes ) followed by the discoveries of penicillin and the dna double helix structure . @entity33 , associate curator of medicine at the @entity7 , told @entity2 that she was " pleasantly surprised " with the results , saying she " wondered whether the therapeutic benefit of penicillin might just edge in front -- or perhaps the apollo 10 capsule as visitors find space travel so inspirational as the ultimate test of technology . " @entity33 attributed the x-ray machine 's popularity to the wide impact it has on people 's everyday life , from the very first steps of a medical diagnosis to security control at airports . " people are just fascinated with seeing inside their bodies --- even today . it has fundamentally changed the way we see and understand our world -- but particularly our bodies . " but i also think visitors are aware of the immense and various benefits x-rays have brought -- revolutionizing medical diagnosis and therapy but also astronomy and material and chemical science -- it was x-rays that enabled us to discover the structure of dna after all !

" i want to keep the aid flowing to @entity8 , " he said , " but it has to be with the understanding that @entity8 's going to march toward democracy , not toward a military dictatorship . and that 's the message we 're going to send to the @entity17 . the only way you 're going to be part of @entity8 is to allow @entity8 to get back to work . stop playing politics .

nine people aboard the @placeholder - flagged @entity29 died in the raid	@entity30	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- defense minister @entity2 testified tuesday that he bears full responsibility for the actions of @entity6 soldiers in the mid-sea interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla that left nine people dead in may . he defended the action and said @entity6 went to great diplomatic lengths to stop the flotilla heading to the @entity14 territory of @entity15 , and when that did n't work , it considered the implications of the use of force and weighed the possibility of simply letting the flotilla through . in the end , @entity6 made the right decision , @entity2 said in his two - hour testimony before an @entity6 commission looking into the incident . @entity6 navy commandos intercepted the flotilla at sea and stormed the largest vessel , the @entity30 - flagged @entity29 . " we regret any loss of life , but without the courage and skill of the commandos we would have lost more lives , " @entity2 said . the @entity6 navy commando fought with activists on the ship , leaving one @entity30 - @entity41 and eight @entity30 activists dead and sparking an international outcry . the incident left a wide - ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the jewish state and @entity30 , its powerful regional ally , badly shaken . @entity48 @entity47 ban ki - moon expressed hope that a separate @entity48 inquiry , launched tuesday , would help mend the strained relations . @entity47 met with members of the @entity48 panel , which is chaired by @entity55 prime minister @entity54 and includes representatives from @entity6 and @entity30 . but @entity6 has already said that it will not participate in the @entity48 inquiry if the panel asks to question soldiers . " prime minister @entity61 clarifies that @entity6 will not cooperate and will not participate in any panel that will demand to interrogate @entity64 soldiers , " said government spokesman @entity60 . @entity61 said @entity6 operated within international law when it stopped the flotilla and raided the @entity29 on may 31 . " i 'm convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will be clear that the state of @entity6 ... operated in accordance with international law and that ... soldiers on the @entity29 showed great courage in fulfilling their mission and acting in self - defense against real - life dangers , " @entity61 said monday , the opening day of the @entity6 probe . @entity6 has maintained its troops used force on the activists only after they were attacked by those on board . soldiers were attacked with knives , metal poles and other objects , @entity6 officials have said . but passengers on board the boat insist they were fired upon without provocation . the ships were carrying humanitarian aid to @entity15 , organizers said . the @entity14 territory has been blockaded by @entity6 since its takeover by the @entity101 movement @entity100 in 2007 .

" i have put my life in danger and have come to @entity3 -- to you to be the savior of this country , " he said at the airport . " i have come to save @entity3 . " he chided people who had doubted that he would return . " there were rumors that i would not come -- where are those people now ? " he asked . " i am here . i have returned . " at the airport , crowds danced , waved the nation 's green flag and chanted @entity1 's name . some people carried giant posters , plastered with his face . " @entity34 ( @entity33 willing ) we will be successful if i have your support , " he said . after his statement , he was whisked away to an undisclosed location for safety reasons . police hovered nearby , guns slung from their shoulders . complicated return @entity1 resigned as president of the south @entity46 nation five years ago and went into exile in @entity48 and @entity49 . he hopes to reassert his influence and lead his party in may elections . his return comes with complications . government officials have said he would be arrested as soon as he sets foot in the nation while the @entity3 @entity12 have vowed to assassinate him . however , his party says it has taken pre-emptive measures to ward off a potential arrest . " @entity1 has been granted bail in advance of his arrival to @entity3 . we have made sure that he is not arrested and his return home will be smooth , " said @entity63 , a member of the former president 's party , @entity64 . his lawyers paid an unknown amount of bail , which means @entity1 will not be arrested for at least 15 days , but must appear in court . fear of the unknown @entity1 's return home comes with a lot of uncertainties . as he boarded a flight from @entity77 , @entity1 said he was not nervous , but was concerned about the unknown . his wife , @entity79 , had a different answer when asked if she was worried . " who would n't be ? " she said . last year , he scuttled plans to return home after the military warned him not to . " there were indications that they did n't want me to come , and my own colleagues told me not to come , " @entity1 said . " therefore , i changed my mind .

" the move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court 's ruling on whether he could seek another five - year term . although the chief justice was reinstated , the damage was done . @entity3 were also disillusioned with @entity1 's policies that led to shortages of essential food items , power cuts and skyrocketing inflation . however , under his leadership , @entity3 attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate . along with that came a growing middle class , more aggressive news media , and a more assertive judiciary . ' @entity168 ' threat @entity3 also disapproved of the way @entity1 carried out his end of the " war on terror " and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves . after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks against the @entity94 , @entity1 supported the @entity94 war on terror and targeted the @entity12 . the militants have accused him of pushing an @entity94 agenda in @entity3 . an opportune time @entity1 's return comes at an opportune time . last week , @entity3 marked the first time a democratically elected government has served a full five - year term in the country 's 65 - year history . while the ruling @entity185 rode to power on the back of discontent with @entity1 , it had to deal with the same problems that plagued @entity1 : food shortages and power cuts . five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget . on sunday , election officials named former chief justice @entity195 as interim prime minister . he will head the caretaker administration through the may elections . it remains to be seen whether @entity3 , now soured by the @entity185 's reign , will welcome @entity1 back with open arms . explosives - packed water tanker targets @entity3 military checkpoint ; 17 killed @entity0 's @entity204 contributed to this report from @entity9	@entity112:Rawalpindi	@entity131:Sindh	@entity34:Inshallah	@entity3:Pakistani	@entity1:Musharraf	@entity0:CNN	@entity9:Karachi	@entity79:Sehba	@entity77:Dubai International Airport	@entity132:Home Ministry	@entity33:God	@entity12:Taliban	@entity99:Bhutto	@entity107:Afghanistan	@entity97:United Arab Emirates	@entity96:United Kingdom	@entity95:Canada	@entity94:American	@entity204:Leone Lakhani	@entity143:Supreme Court	@entity168:Death squad	@entity185:PPP	@entity63:Jawed Siddiqui	@entity46:Asian	@entity64:All Pakistan Muslim League	@entity48:London	@entity49:Dubai	@entity195:Mir Hazar Khan Khoso
@placeholder wins @entity26 primary in stunning turnaround	@entity0	@entity0 won saturday 's @entity2 presidential primary , marking a stunning turnaround for a candidate who finished fourth in @entity5 and @entity6 and whose campaign had been left for dead -- again -- by observers just weeks ago . with about 95 % of polling places reporting , @entity9 had 40 % of the vote , with former @entity13 gov. @entity12 getting 27 % and former @entity15 sen. @entity14 getting 17 % . @entity15 rep. @entity16 of @entity17 had 13 % . based on early returns and exit polls , @entity18 projected @entity9 the winner . in his victory speech to supporters , @entity9 thanked " everyone in @entity26 who decided to be with us in changing @entity28 . " " it is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track -- so many people who are so concerned about jobs , about medical costs , about the everyday parts of life , and who feel that the elites in @entity28 and @entity40 have no understanding , no care , no concern , no reliability , and in fact do not represent them at all , " @entity9 said . @entity9 , whose surge has been helped in part by two strong debate performances in @entity26 , said that if he 's resonating with voters , it 's not just because he 's a good debater . up - to - minute updates on @entity18 's live blog " it 's that i articulate the deepest - held values of the @entity15 people , " he said . since the beginning of the modern @entity2 primary system in 1980 , this is the first time that three different @entity2 candidates won nominating contests in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity26 . the winner of the @entity26 primary , which this year is the third contest on the primary and caucus calendar , has gone on to win the @entity70 nomination in every election since 1980 . less than a week ago , @entity12 , the @entity6 winner , was looking at a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in @entity26 , a big lead in @entity76 and the possibility of a clear path to the @entity2 nomination . but @entity9 turned in two strong debate performances in the state this week while @entity12 was put on his heels by his rivals . @entity12 congratulated @entity9 in remarks to his supporters after polls closed saturday night . " this race is getting to be even more interesting , " @entity12 said . " ... we 're now three contests into a long primary season . this is a hard fight because there is so much worth fighting for . " how they voted in @entity26 " our campaign has fought very hard here in @entity26 , and in the coming weeks and months , i 'll keep fighting for every single vote . i will compete in every single state , " he said . " we 're going to win this nomination , and we 're going to defeat president @entity102 in november . " @entity14 , the @entity5 winner , also congratulated @entity9 on saturday night . nearly an hour earlier , he told @entity18 that the battle between the first three contests ' winners is just beginning . " the great narrative is that three days ago , there was an inevitability in this race , " @entity14 said . " @entity12 was 2 - 0 ( before @entity5 officials switched the narrow @entity5 result this week ) and soon to be 3 - 0 , and i took @entity5 , @entity0 took @entity26 , and it 's game on again . " @entity14 said he was preparing not only to campaign in @entity76 , where the next primary awaits on january 31 , but in other states , indicating he believed he had what it took to sustain his campaign for a long fight . " this is a long race . as a result of what happened here tonight , this race is n't going to be over next week or the week after , " @entity14 said . " this is going to be a long one , and it 's going to be the best thing that could happen for whoever the eventual @entity70 nominee is , because that nominee is going to be sharpened by steel . " @entity16 told supporters he expected to get four to five times as many votes in @entity26 as he did four years ago . " so there 's every reason to be encouraged , " he said . @entity9 's @entity26 turnaround is just his latest . he came out of nowhere to top national polls in late fall on the strength of debate performances , but dropped again ahead of the @entity5 caucuses as opponents hammered him in @entity5 ads. " @entity9 has been harder to kill than @entity143 , " @entity70 strategist and @entity18 contributor @entity145 said saturday . " he has been dead three times in this campaign , and ... the guy keeps coming back . " are you voting in the @entity26 primary ? share your story according to exit polls saturday , 38 % of voters said they decided whom to vote for in the " last few days , " and 17 % did so on saturday . of the " last few days " crowd , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 26 % took @entity12 . of those who decided saturday , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 21 % took @entity12 . @entity9 won a plurality of votes among all income categories except the one for people making $ 200,000 a year or more , a category that @entity12 won with 47 % , according to the exit polls . the candidates will now focus on @entity76 , where they will debate in @entity164 on monday and at the @entity18 / @entity70 of @entity76 debate in @entity166 on thursday . the former @entity168 speaker has been presenting himself as the conservative alternative to the " @entity13 moderate " @entity12 , while @entity12 continued to attack @entity9 as he has over the past week as polls tightened . @entity12 supporters and donors were grumbling saturday that @entity12 's campaign badly mishandled how he responded to rivals ' demands that he release his tax records . @entity12 said in a @entity18 debate thursday night that he was not sure how many years of tax returns he plans to release but will make them public sometime in april . but as the polls were closing , a @entity12 source tried to downplay the results , noting that @entity12 got only 15 % of the vote in @entity26 in 2008 , a race that eventual nominee sen. @entity185 won . the campaign will immediately pivot to @entity76 , the source said , where " we have a strong organization and big plans for next week . " @entity12 has held a large lead in polls of likely primary voters there , but recent polls show the race tightening a bit there , too . three @entity70 sources told @entity18 that @entity12 has secured the endorsement of former @entity76 gov. @entity201 , who is on many @entity70 ' wish list . but a @entity201 source denied the report , and sources in @entity12 's campaign said if that is true , he had n't told them . the campaign plans a " major " economic speech on tuesday morning as a prebuttal to @entity102 's @entity211 address that evening and differentiate @entity12 from @entity102 and @entity9 . he also plans a reaction speech to @entity102 's address on wednesday morning . @entity12 launched a new line of attack on @entity9 on saturday before polls closed , calling for him to release details on his work for government - backed mortgage giant @entity219 , an institution unpopular with conservatives . " did n't he say he was going to release information about his relationship there ? " @entity12 asked . " let 's see what report he wrote for @entity227 and @entity219 , what his conclusions were and what the contract looked like . i thought he said he was going to do that . " @entity12 's campaign also has been pressing the former @entity168 speaker to release the full report from a 1990s ethics investigation that led to his downfall in @entity239 . @entity9 was reprimanded by the @entity168 and ordered to pay a $ 300,000 penalty in 1997 for violating an ethics rule . this week , @entity12 's campaign sent @entity9 a cake marking the 15th anniversary of that reprimand , according to a @entity12 campaign source . a picture provided by that source shows the wording " happy 15th anniversary , mr. speaker ! ... now release the records , " written in icing on the cake . things reversed quickly for @entity12 in @entity26 this week . as late as tuesday , @entity12 had a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in the state 's primary . then what had been declared an eight - vote @entity12 victory in @entity5 's january 3 caucuses was reversed into a 34 - vote win for @entity14 when the state party certified its results on thursday . later that day , @entity17 gov. @entity265 suspended his campaign and threw his support to @entity9 . " it has been a hard week , " state treasurer @entity268 , a leading @entity12 surrogate , said friday . " nobody is going to deny that . " @entity14 spent the week trying to bring down @entity9 in what most see as a race between the moderate @entity12 against conservatives @entity9 or @entity14 . although most @entity2 strategists see @entity16 's strict interpretation of the @entity277 and his views on defense and spending as out of step with the mainstream , he appeals to libertarian - leaning @entity70 and has a large following among younger voters .	@entity26:South Carolina	@entity28:Washington	@entity277:Constitution	@entity2:GOP	@entity0:Newt Gingrich	@entity6:New Hampshire	@entity5:Iowa	@entity9:Gingrich	@entity239:Congress	@entity219:Freddie Mac	@entity76:Florida	@entity70:Republicans	@entity17:Texas	@entity16:Paul	@entity15:American	@entity14:Rick Santorum	@entity13:Massachusetts	@entity12:Mitt Romney	@entity18:CNN	@entity102:Obama	@entity268:Curtis Loftis	@entity265:Rick Perry	@entity201:Bush	@entity211:State of the Union	@entity145:Alex Castellanos	@entity166:Jacksonville	@entity164:Tampa	@entity227:Fannie Mae	@entity143:Rasputin	@entity168:House	@entity185:John McCain	@entity40:New York

" it 's a little bit dangerous while you are refueling to have people on board , " he said . seeing the ferry boat , the people used the row boats to make their way out to the ferry , to board themselves . once there , they climbed up the side of the boat , and designed their own assembly line of people to help pass luggage , and children , from one person to the other , on board the ferryboat . @entity2 witnessed one infant passed up along a sea of hands from their dinghy all the way to the top of the ferryboat . @entity87 : are you there ? " no one is helping us with crowd control here . no one . we do n't have any help from no one . even from the government , " said ferry owner , @entity21 . " the government gave us fuel and told us to evacuate people to @entity18 and that 's it , " he said . @entity2 watched as one lone @entity1 coast guard vessel tried to approach the ferryboat to curtail the rowboaters , but they were quickly overpowered by the sea of people fleeing . the ferry 's owner told @entity2 his ferry is licensed to carry 600 people , but on the last trip to @entity18 , there were over 3000 onboard . with no serious crowd control and no lifeboats on board , @entity21 's only option to stop the crowds , is to leave . " they 'll do anything to get on the boat . and then it becomes very , very dangerous , " he said . @entity2 took their own rowboat onto the @entity17 , and saw a boat , slowly filling with the desperate refugees . they all appeared to relax once onboard . perhaps , now they can begin to have hope about tomorrow .	@entity17:Trois Rivieres	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Haitians	@entity0:Port-au-Prince	@entity27:Anaika	@entity22:Marinetec	@entity18:Port Jeremie	@entity21:Rouzier	@entity57:USNS Comfort	@entity41:Ivan Watson	@entity87:iReport	@entity64:Twitter

" just think of what you were doing when this happened , " she said she told him . " just think you were standing at the cenotaph . you were honoring others . just think of how proud that will make your family . your family must love you so much . " he never responded . an image of @entity21 and the others bent over @entity4 was captured by photographer @entity95 . but @entity21 said she kept speaking because she had once been in a coma , and although no one could tell , she could hear everything . " i just repeated , repeated , repeated that he was a brave man , that he was a good man , that he was loved , that he was respected , " she said . off asked @entity21 what instinct prompted her to speak to him about love . she paused a moment before answering . " i think you tell people when they 're sick , or when they 're ill , or when they 're hurting that they 're loved . because everybody 's loved , " she said through tears , " by somebody .

@placeholder also is recording his 13th @entity2 album	@entity16	( @entity0 ) -- when @entity2 chose @entity3 , the @entity5 electronica production team of @entity6 and @entity7 , to open for them on their 2009 @entity10 tour , they did n't know it would be just the beginning of their musical collaboration . but , as mutual fans , with front man @entity16 enjoying @entity3 ' work with singer @entity18 and @entity6 's love of the seminal albums " violator " and " @entity22 , " it was only a matter of time . following in their tradition of joining forces with high - profile guest vocalists , @entity3 turned their attention to @entity16 for their latest album , " @entity33 the dead can see . " @entity0 recently spoke to @entity16 about what inspired the soaring new songs , what fans can expect from the new @entity37 being recorded now and how " @entity40 " changed his life . @entity0 : how did working on this album compare to recording a @entity2 or solo record for you ? it seems like a big enough task to have one great idea , never mind be able to parcel them out to different projects like you do . @entity16 : it 's interesting that you said that about the one good idea . with " presence of @entity56 , " for instance , it 's one phrase or one sentence and the way i sing that . the notes that i choose to sing will sometimes do it . if i get that one line , i 'm like , yes ! that leads me somewhere else . that 's when things start getting really exciting . the stuff with @entity6 was a different process for me . i never sat down and said , ok , i 'm writing songs now for this or for that . i was n't choosing this subject or that subject . it seemed to work with the music and i did n't want to edit that . i did n't want to bend it into a different direction . it was really a pure process , and i think you hear that . " @entity85 " was one of the first things i worked on . when i sent it back to @entity6 , he was blown away by what i 'd done over the guitar chords he 'd given to me and it started the process between us . these songs really kind of wrote themselves . i ca n't describe it in any better way . i just had to get out of the way , really . @entity0 : speaking of blessed , you explore spirituality on this album , especially on " presence of @entity56 , " and have said that may make people uncomfortable . sure , it 's more direct than what @entity2 usually does , but was it really such a major departure ? @entity16 : not at all . i think that 's because @entity106 [ @entity107 ] and i shake from the same hip as well . in the past , especially in the " violator " and " @entity22 " period , i felt like @entity106 was writing songs about me or for me . he was n't really ; i was younger then . but we had those same doubts , and quite often seemed to experience the same weird , dark sense of humor . " @entity122 " is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what 's going on around you , you get answers to the questions you were asking . the title " @entity124 " works so well because sometimes when you 're still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen . it 's when i 'm trying to figure that out for myself that i get into all kinds of trouble . @entity0 : it 's a delicate balance to explore these subjects in your lyrics and not alienate the audience by coming across as tortured or preachy . how did you manage to pull it off ? @entity16 : i 'm glad you heard that . there was no torture at all . it really came easy , this stuff . for me , that doubt and that faith are so close . it 's impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things . but it 's not hokey in any way . i 'm not trying to tell you what to do . it 's purely my experience of feeling like i really belong , and then moments of really what the f -- k am i doing ? we all have that . i tried to keep that as open as possible without directing . i do n't want to direct you . i want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts . @entity0 : the album is beautiful -- both melancholy and uplifting at the same time . how did you go about hitting those emotional nerves ? @entity16 : i think some of that stuff comes from the way i used my voice . i go to a very visual place when i 'm singing . it 's very cinematic and i get this feeling of space . i love when music does that . i listened to @entity40 a lot when i was a teenager . the place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that i wanted to go to . i did n't know if that place really existed , but i believed it did . i tried to capture that same magic again on this record . it 's a place you go to when you listen , where you just feel a sense of belonging . or , not feeling a sense of belonging and that being ok . @entity0 : is there any one @entity40 line , image or album that was able to transport you more than others ? @entity16 : there 's many records that have been pivotal for me . if i were to name one , it would be " @entity40 . " it changed my life . the same thing happened when punk rock came along and i heard the @entity201 for the first time . i was 16 or 17 years old . it made me feel like i belonged to something . music has always done that and continues to do that for me . lately , a record that i bought that i 'm really listening to a lot is the new @entity211 album , " @entity212 . " there 's a sense of humor to me in the combination of his words and his musical styles . it just spoke to me and brought a smile to my face . some may listen to that record and not get the same feeling , but it 's really uplifting and a beautiful record . @entity0 : you are currently recording your 13th @entity2 album . can you give us a hint about what we can expect ? @entity16 : @entity106 's been particularly prolific , and myself as well . i was doing the @entity3 thing and writing demos for @entity2 with a friend . @entity106 got on a writing streak . he 's got some really great songs . we usually start a record with six or seven songs ; we currently have about 20 . in the studio , we 're trying to not over-fuss things . we 're trying to not over-produce the sound . if something 's working , we 're just recording it . we 're trying to get the element of performance into the record more . we 've already been talking to @entity248 about some ideas we have about where we want to take the record visually and he usually has a pretty great angle . the songs have a bluesy influence . obviously , it 's not a blues record , but there 's definitely some of those influences there . and it has a kind of soulful feel as well . it 's still early so it 's difficult to tell at this stage . we 've been making records for a long time together , but there 's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a @entity2 record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves .	@entity22:Songs of Faith and Devotion	@entity85:I Ca n't Stay	@entity124:The Light the Dead See	@entity3:Soulsavers	@entity2:Depeche Mode	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Ian Glover	@entity6:Rich	@entity5:English	@entity56:God	@entity248:Anton Corbijn	@entity16:Gahan	@entity33:The Light	@entity37:Depeche Mode LP	@entity10:European	@entity18:Mark Lanegan	@entity106:Martin	@entity107:Gore	@entity201:Clash	@entity122:Presence of God	@entity211:Spiritualized	@entity212:Sweet Heart Sweet Light	@entity40:Ziggy Stardust
result pushes @entity3 to within a point of @placeholder leaders @entity25	@entity5	( @entity1 ) @entity0 and @entity2 combined to ensure @entity3 returned to winning @entity5 ways by overcoming lowly @entity6 3 - 1 saturday on a far from perfect pitch at the @entity8 . @entity9 pounced to open the scoring from close - range midway through the first half before @entity2 added to the @entity14 's advantage just after half - time . @entity16 pulled one back for @entity6 from the penalty spot but @entity0 restored @entity3 's two - goal advantage 20 minutes from the end when set up by @entity2 . after losing at home to @entity24 last weekend , @entity22 's men were keen to ensure they fell no further behind arch rivals @entity25 in the @entity5 standings . the result means @entity3 moves to within one point of @entity25 who play @entity30 sunday . " i am very happy and satisfied with the work the players did in very special conditions , " @entity22 told reporters after the match . " the teams have to be commended for the game they played on grass like that . they both tried to play a passing game , and that 's worth highlighting . " @entity22 had rotated his squad after midweek victory at @entity46 in the @entity47 . @entity3 legend @entity48 returned to the starting lineup but the potent attacking triumvirate of @entity0 , @entity2 and @entity51 remained in place . the purposeful , all - action performance of @entity2 , who scored twice in midweek against @entity46 , came in for particular praise from @entity22 . " ever since he arrived , @entity2 has been playing top class football and working very hard , " he said . " he may look more spectacular now and people are seeing more of him , but he has always been a special player that does a lot for the team . " with @entity61 and @entity62 contesting the @entity64 final at @entity65 sunday , there was a reduced fixture card in @entity67 saturday . @entity68 scored two second half goals as @entity70 overcame ten - man @entity71 at @entity73 to keep up its chase for a @entity47 spot . but @entity70 old - boy @entity76 was sent off under controversial circumstances after it appeared referee @entity79 mistook him for team - mate @entity80 who looked to have fouled @entity82 ' striker @entity81 . although @entity71 players complained that @entity76 had not touched @entity81 , @entity83 stood by his decision after consulting with his assistants . elsewhere , relegation threatened @entity88 fell 1 - 0 at home to @entity90 while @entity91 overcame @entity92 by the same scoreline at the @entity94 . @entity95 ensured @entity97 's tricky start to life as @entity100 manager continued with @entity101 scoring as the only goal as the @entity103 won 1 - 0 at @entity104 . an early goal from @entity107 's young striker @entity106 , meanwhile , was enough to ease out @entity108 at the @entity109 . in the @entity112 early fixture @entity110 upset @entity113 3 - 1 . striker @entity114 scored twice for @entity110 before being sent off for a second bookable offense late on . @entity118 's @entity117 resurrection continued with a 3 - 0 home victory over local rivals @entity120 in the @entity122 derby . although the scoreline and performance were ultimately convincing , @entity118 did n't break the deadlock until @entity126 scored in the 78th minute . @entity127 added a second four minutes from the end before @entity129 rounded off the scoring in injury time . the win is @entity118 's fourth in a row in the league and pushes @entity137 's men further clear of the relegation zone they occupied only a matter of weeks ago .	@entity22:Enrique	@entity24:Malaga	@entity16:Fran Rico	@entity107:West Brom	@entity80:John O'Shea	@entity81:Falcao	@entity82:Red Devils	@entity83:East	@entity113:West Ham	@entity112:Premier Leagues	@entity110:Palace	@entity88:Burnley	@entity137:Jurgen Klopp	@entity118:Dortmund	@entity3:Barca	@entity2:Suarez	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Messi	@entity6:Granada	@entity5:La Liga	@entity9:Rakitic	@entity8:Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes	@entity51:Neymar	@entity47:Champions League	@entity79:Roger East	@entity91:Stoke City	@entity76:Brown	@entity71:Sunderland	@entity70:United	@entity73:Old Trafford	@entity30:Villarreal	@entity14:Catalan	@entity100:Aston Villa	@entity101:Papiss Cisse	@entity103:Magpies	@entity104:St. James ' Park	@entity25:Real Madrid	@entity106:Saido Berahino	@entity129:Marco Reus	@entity97:Tim Sherwood	@entity109:Hawthorns	@entity95:Newcastle United	@entity94:Britannia Stadium	@entity122:Ruhr	@entity92:Hull City	@entity120:Schalke	@entity90:Swansea City	@entity108:Southampton	@entity117:Bundesliga	@entity126:Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang	@entity62:Tottenham	@entity46:City	@entity114:Glen Murray	@entity68:Wayne Rooney	@entity67:England	@entity64:League Cup	@entity65:Wembley	@entity48:Xavi	@entity127:Henrikh Mkhitaryan	@entity61:Chelsea
@entity1 to rejoin @entity5 's military command , @placeholder president @entity3 announces	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 will soon rejoin @entity5 's military command more than 40 years after it left , @entity1 president @entity3 said tuesday . @entity1 president @entity3 has aligned @entity1 more closely with the @entity6 @entity1 was a founding member of the alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid frictions with the @entity6 . @entity1 has continued , however , to contribute troops to @entity5 missions and to participate in @entity5 's political bodies . analysts expect that when @entity1 takes over the rotating six - month presidency of the @entity16 next month , @entity3 will try to boost the @entity16 defense dimension . some nations , particularly the @entity6 , have been suspicious of a greater @entity16 defense initiative , seeing it as an attempt to undermine @entity5 . @entity3 's move , which he has signaled for months , could be seen as an attempt to reconcile the two sides and help the @entity6 warm to the idea of the @entity16 having its own security organization . " basically , the tradeoff is that they no longer suspect @entity1 motives in pushing for a greater @entity16 defense dimension because of @entity3 's willingness to make @entity1 a fully participating member of @entity5 , " said @entity28 , @entity2 's @entity29 political editor . from its earliest years , @entity5 's transatlantic ties were strained because @entity6 analysts warned that if the @entity29 allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance , they risked losing the support of the @entity6 , according to @entity5 . the @entity29 allies felt the @entity6 was trying to dominate @entity5 , and the resulting frictions led @entity1 president @entity42 to withdraw from @entity5 's military structure in 1966 , according to @entity5 . that decision meant no @entity1 forces could be under permanent allied command and that @entity1 would have no participation in defense planning . in 1995 , @entity1 rejoined @entity5 's military committee , which advises @entity5 's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to @entity5 's strategic commanders . while @entity1 was still not a part of the military command , it contributed troops and funding to @entity5 activities , including @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity65 . some 5,000 @entity1 troops are currently committed to @entity5 operations and @entity1 contributes 13.8 percent of its military budget to the alliance , according to the @entity70 . the @entity72 , an @entity16 think tank , said @entity3 's move will end a " ruinous quarrel " between @entity29 's two main security organizations -- @entity5 and the @entity16 defense initiative . " @entity3 has broken a long - standing taboo in @entity1 foreign policy and opened the possibility of a dramatic improvement in @entity16 - @entity5 cooperation , " the @entity72 said in december , after the president hinted at the move he made tuesday . the @entity29 security and defense policy , or @entity86 , has its origins in the 1990s , when @entity16 leaders decided @entity29 needed its own military and civilian capabilities for security . so far , the @entity86 is still just a framing of common defense policy which might one day lead to a common defense , according to the @entity16 . the @entity86 does not involve the creation of a @entity29 army , the @entity16 says .	@entity3:Sarkozy	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:France	@entity0:PARIS	@entity6:U.S.	@entity5:NATO	@entity16:EU	@entity28:Robin Oakley	@entity29:European	@entity63:Kosovo	@entity42:Charles de Gaulle	@entity86:ESDP	@entity64:ISAF	@entity65:Afghanistan	@entity62:KFOR	@entity70:French Foreign Ministry	@entity72:CER

@placeholder : @entity47 wo n't reduce nasty humor , but his " just plain funny " style can succeed	@entity153	( @entity0 ) -- a lot of us were rooting for @entity3 on monday night . given the contentious recent history of the host chair -- @entity6 to @entity7 to @entity6 -- he was standing on a media trapdoor , with critics just waiting to pull the lever . early reviews say he not only survived one of the highest - pressure debuts ever -- he killed it . if nothing else , a big debut buys you time . but does victimless humor -- the kind that does not slice , dice and julienne its subjects -- have legs in a culture that likes its entertainment with a serrated edge ? it 's a question that applies across demographics -- from the prized millennials , who have grown up on the discord of reality television ; to the baby boomers , who are decades into acerbic late night as we know it -- and will have to adjust to bits like slow rolling the news . it 's a tough neighborhood , with @entity3 a little like @entity41 walking the streets of a war zone . or , as @entity44 jokingly ( but not inaccurately ) said on monday night : " welcome to 11:30 , bitch . " one of @entity47 's established competitors , @entity48 , in a recent monologue said that @entity50 met her @entity52 © e when her car broke down and @entity50 " pulls up behind her in her tow truck . " ( pause for nervous laughter at the lesbian joke . ) @entity50 , predictably , was not amused , firing back to @entity58 : " i do n't remember making fun of you when you had sex with all your interns . " @entity3 's humor can be topical , but almost always with a softer touch : @entity65 saying she does n't know if she 'll run for president is like him saying " i still do n't know if i 'll have a beer on @entity68 . " somehow , i do n't think there will be any fights with @entity50 . and in a broader context , it 's a tough entertainment media in general . look no further than reality television , populated by macho slimeballs , back - biting boyfriend stealers and assorted high achievers in the low art of interpersonal nastiness . there is a whole new genre allowing us to make fun of rural @entity84 . no , @entity85 , we 're not laughing with you . there is even research that the mean - spirited swamp that is reality tv is starting to seep into the culture in general . researchers at @entity92 showed 250 women three scenes : one violent , one frightening and one showing gossip -- including a woman who ostracized a friend . all got a response , but the highest mental arousal was category three , which the researchers termed " relational aggression . " in other words , watching people be mean to each other may " prime the brain " to be mean ourselves . @entity3 's ( we 're all friends just joking around ) humor might be up against something even bigger -- right in his demographic sweet spot . a @entity111 of @entity113 study looked at 72 studies of empathy among college students over 30 years . they found that empathy -- the ability to identify with others and relate to their feelings -- has dropped an incredible 40 % since 2000 . among the reasons : the technology - driven isolation , a generational sense of entitlement and social media 's ability to call attention to ourselves . also responsible is the winning - is - everything sports culture and huge paydays for those who climb to the top of their fields . all told , if there were a sequel today to dr. @entity139 ' classic " i 'm ok , you 're ok " , it might be : " i 'm ok , you 're pathetic . " can @entity3 save the world from mean humor ? doubtful ; there is a big market for cynical , biting and demeaning . but let 's hope that his first show says there is also room for just plain funny . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .	@entity3:Jimmy	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:O'Brien	@entity6:Leno	@entity111:University of Michigan Institute	@entity44:Stephen Colbert	@entity52:fiancÃ	@entity58:Dave	@entity50:Rosie	@entity84:America	@entity41:Bambi	@entity68:St. Patrick 's Day	@entity47:Fallon	@entity153:Drexler	@entity139:Thomas Harris	@entity113:Social Research	@entity65:Hillary Clinton	@entity48:David Letterman	@entity92:Iowa State University	@entity85:Mama June
tech companies such as @placeholder or @entity3 are planning major robotics initiatives	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 : all of these big tech companies have announced major robotics initiatives or investments in recent months . @entity1 , in particular , managed to capture the public imagination when founder @entity8 outlined a plan to deliver packages by drones . as drones become more mainstream , the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom . drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level . for example , it would n't be surprising if @entity1 delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention . so what would stop law enforcement from asking @entity1 for all of its drones ' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime ? simultaneously , drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery , agriculture , photography and possibly disrupt major industries . imagine that you 're shopping at @entity36 . you ask for a book that the store does not carry . rather than send you online , @entity36 flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break . or imagine that you 're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early . you could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas . these are exciting uses for drones . but the real innovation will come when companies such as @entity1 mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms . what does that mean ? recall that the first personal computers did not come to the market until the mid- 1970s . before that , government and industry purchased or leased computer equipment dedicated to a particular purpose such as database management . that 's analogous to what @entity1 and other companies are doing today . @entity1 paid nearly $ 800 million for the robotics firm @entity67 for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses . the company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery . the real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people . suddenly consumers did not have to wait for @entity81 or @entity2 to write every software program they might want to use . other companies and individuals could also write a " killer app. " much of the software that makes personal computers , tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third - party developers . as author @entity94 points out , it would be hard to name a category of important software -- from word - processing to e-mail -- that some computer hobbyist did not create first at home . today , popular apps such as @entity102 or @entity103 are used by millions of people . yet , both were created by just two or three people in their 20s . there are , of course , problems with apps for robots . you do not necessarily want a live - action version of @entity115 using drones . and who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots ? once companies such as @entity3 , @entity1 or @entity2 create a personal drone that is app - enabled , we will begin to see the true promise of this technology . this is still a ways off . there are certainly many technical , regulatory and social hurdles to overcome . but i would think that within 10 to 15 years , we will see robust , multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers . worried about your kid getting to and from the bus ? a drone app lets you follow her there by trailing her phone and returning when she waves . selling your house ? an app on a drone will command it to fly around your property and stitch together a panorama of photos for a virtual tour . same drone , thousands of possibilities . put another way , the day when @entity1 or @entity2 opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off . on an open model , the sky is quite literally the limit . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .	@entity3:Google	@entity2:Apple	@entity1:Amazon	@entity0:CNN	@entity36:Barnes & Noble	@entity8:Jeff Bezos	@entity102:Snapchat	@entity81:IBM	@entity115:Angry Birds	@entity103:Instagram	@entity159:Calo	@entity67:Kiva Systems	@entity94:Jonathan Zittrain
@entity52 and @entity98 had a falling out with @placeholder	@entity6	if the @entity2 truce holds and @entity4 's @entity3 comes to its conclusion , some things are certain . both @entity4 and @entity6 will declare military victory -- @entity4 pointing to the destruction of militants ' tunnels and depletion of @entity6 ' rocket supply ; @entity6 pointing to dozens of dead @entity4 troops and the survival of @entity6 leadership in @entity2 . but unlike in previous conflicts , when @entity6 had the support of many @entity19 nations , things have changed . this time , as @entity22 has reported , the fighting between @entity4 and @entity6 has been a proxy war for the @entity24 . key regional players @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have their own reasons to want to fend off the @entity31 , of which @entity6 is part , experts say . and @entity34 , like the @entity33 , lists @entity6 as a terrorist organization for its numerous attacks on civilians . but the group does have the support of some countries . " it 's no longer the @entity46 against the @entity47 , " said @entity41 , vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the @entity44 . " now it 's the extremists -- the @entity31 , @entity6 , @entity50 , and their backers @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- against @entity4 and the more moderate @entity46 including @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 . " a look at some key @entity6 supporters : @entity54 prime minister @entity57 openly supports @entity6 . " @entity57 has tried to use the cause of the @entity31 to bolster his own @entity62 credentials at home , " says @entity58 , of the @entity59 . @entity54 also has " more of an ideological sympathy with the @entity31 , " @entity58 says . @entity53 @entity53 supported the @entity31 in @entity28 -- which was toppled from power in a coup last year . @entity53 funds many @entity31 figures in exile , including @entity6 political leader @entity69 , who is believed to have orchestrated numerous terrorist attacks . " @entity53 has a long history of providing shelter to @entity62 groups , amongst them the @entity31 and the @entity77 , " @entity71 of the @entity72 tells @entity73 . advocating for @entity6 is beneficial to @entity54 and @entity53 in their political objectives because the cause draws popular support at home , says world affairs writer @entity82 in a @entity22 column . but some question whether @entity53 's support for @entity6 is still strong . the country 's financial support to the group " largely dried up " as @entity53 sought " to mend ties with its neighbors , with whom it had fallen out in part for backing the @entity31 in @entity28 , " the @entity86 said . while @entity53 and @entity54 are powerful allies , " @entity6 might wish for more support given the breadth of the @entity19 world , " @entity73 reported . @entity52 and @entity98 in the past , @entity52 and @entity98 supported @entity6 . @entity52 supplied the group with weapons ; @entity98 was home to @entity69 . but @entity69 did not support @entity98 president @entity102 in the country 's civil war . in 2012 , @entity69 left for @entity53 , causing a breakdown in his relationship with both @entity98 and its ally @entity52 , says @entity108 , head of @entity24 and @entity109 and forecasting at the global information company @entity111 . and while @entity52 still professes to support @entity6 , such claims " are more ostentatious , showy , exaggerated and theatrical rather than genuine and practical , " writes @entity114 , an @entity52 - @entity33 scholar at @entity115 , in a column for @entity117 . @entity52 , which is a muslim but not an @entity19 nation , " uses @entity6 ( as well as @entity120 's support for the @entity122 cause ) as a tool to project its power and influence in the @entity19 world , " he argues . the @entity86 says @entity52 , while cutting its funding to @entity6 in recent years , " sought to bolster its ties to other resistance groups in the region , such as @entity132 . " @entity50 the @entity135 militant group based in @entity135 is aligned with @entity102 's regime in @entity98 . during the conflict , @entity50 reached out to @entity6 , praising its " steadfastness . " this does not mean the relationship is repaired to where it stood before @entity98 's civil war , but " a new realignment might happen , " @entity139 of the @entity140 told @entity73 . popular support @entity6 ' greatest support in the wake of the conflict with @entity4 may be from the public in @entity2 and other parts of the @entity19 world . " @entity6 is not a monolith , nor is it only a terrorist group , " @entity154 of the @entity86 writes on @entity22 . " it is a social movement , with a mass membership , a popular message of resistance that resonates across the @entity127 world , and a political party with which we must negotiate . " some analysts believe @entity6 will emerge stronger from the fight with @entity4 . the conflict " will only further radicalize the @entity122 population -- and alienate frustrated friends in the @entity33 , " @entity165 of @entity166 argues . before @entity3 , a poll by the @entity59 found that most @entity122 in @entity2 oppose a two - state solution and want to work toward abolishing @entity4 -- a goal that is in line with @entity6 ' charter . but the poll also found most @entity122 support nonviolent methods of achieving their goals . support could affect arms supply while @entity6 ' recruitment might soar now , militarily the group " is on the ropes , " with tunnels destroyed and much of its rocket supply depleted , writes @entity179 , retired @entity33 @entity180 intelligence officer and @entity22 military analyst . " after similar conflicts in the past , @entity6 has been rearmed and resupplied by its supporters , primarily @entity52 and to some extent @entity98 . the most efficient method for the rearming and resupply effort has been via the large number of smuggling tunnels between @entity2 and @entity28 's @entity197 . " that is not likely to be the case this time -- another blow to @entity6 , which it must factor in to its assessment of this conflict as well as its future planning .

@entity11 's late error gives three - time @entity4 winners @placeholder a winning start	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's bid for a record fourth @entity4 final title began with a 2 - 1 victory over neighbors @entity7 in @entity8 on tuesday , thanks to a late goalkeeping error by the defending champions ' @entity11 . @entity11 completely misjudged a dipping free - kick from out on the left by @entity14 , which bounced in front of him and appeared to go through his legs in the 84th minute . one of the fiercest rivalries in world football produced a relatively low - key affair , with the booking received by @entity7 substitute @entity22 that led to the goal being the only yellow card brandished by @entity26 referee @entity25 . @entity2 made the worst possible start in the long - awaited pivotal match in @entity29 when conceding the opening goal against the run of play in the 12th minute . an ominous sign ahead of the @entity34 ? @entity7 skipper @entity35 , the player of the tournament four years ago after netting the only goal of the final against @entity39 , was credited with the score after ramming the ball home from right on the line after @entity45 's header back across the box appeared to be heading in anyway . however , @entity2 leveled three minutes before halftime when @entity48 beat the offside trap to collect @entity51 's clever pass into the penalty area and beat goalkeeper @entity11 for his ninth international goal . pitch warfare : @entity2 take on @entity7 the @entity55 could not make their dominance count until @entity11 's mistake , with @entity48 coming closest to scoring shortly before that lapse when he hit the sidenetting . @entity60 was barely half - full for a match between nations at war from 1980 - 88 , with a brief period of silence before the kickoff in honor of the77 people who died in @entity2 after a plane crash on sunday . " when these two teams play each other there 's so much rivalry and history , so it 's very difficult to get the players to concentrate and focus on football and it becomes a fighting game , " @entity2 coach @entity70 said in quotes reported by the @entity73 news agency . " i was very happy my players were able to concentrate and could get this very special three points . " @entity85 and the @entity86 earlier kicked off the @entity29 schedule with a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity89 in match between teams ranked 105th and 108th in the world respectively . captain @entity93 missed an eighth - minute penalty for the @entity95 , who qualified for the @entity97 but lost all three matches , after @entity99 fouled @entity101 - based striker @entity100 . five football matches that changed the world the @entity109 side , runners - up when hosts in 1996 , went on to dominate the game after @entity93 's spotkick hit the bar but could not beat goalkeeper @entity111 . the @entity86 had won their only previous @entity4 encounter in 1992 -- the communist country 's last @entity4 appearance , and second since it began in 1956 .

director says the @placeholder ' music has been a key influence in his films	@entity6	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- two titans of showbusiness have come together in a perfect pairing : the @entity6 , the world 's greatest band , play two nights at @entity10 's intimate @entity9 ; capturing the night on camera is celebrated film director , @entity11 . shared history , mutual respect : the @entity6 and @entity11 the result is " @entity16 , " which records @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity21 's performance at the end of " @entity23 , " their monumental two - year , record - breaking , $ 558 million , 144 - date global tour that saw 4.6 million ticket holders watch the rock giants . the @entity6 / @entity11 combo is backed by a team of @entity31 - winning cinematographers , more than 18 cameras , duets with the @entity35 ' @entity34 , pop starlet @entity36 and blues granddaddy @entity37 , plus a cameo from a former @entity40 president : the @entity6 juggernaut is well and truly in town . @entity11 is no stranger to the world of rock music . he cut his teeth as an editor on seminal 1970 documentary " @entity48 " and aside from making some of the silver screen 's finest movies ( " @entity51 , " " @entity52 , " " @entity53 , " " @entity54 " ) , he is also the master behind definitive rockumentaries " @entity56 , " which captured @entity58 's final performance , and @entity59 epic , " @entity61 . " but apart from his musical collaborations , rock has underpinned many of the master 's greatest moments -- and his relationship with the @entity6 goes way back . the @entity6 themselves have provided the backing track for classic @entity11 scenes : notably , @entity76 's @entity75 mobster 's entrance in " @entity54 " to the thumping sound of " @entity72 " and " @entity78 " behind @entity80 's introduction in " @entity52 " ; while " @entity51 " features " @entity71 " and , again , " @entity72 . " @entity11 , who pioneered the use of rock music on " @entity52 , " has said that his use of eclectic soundtracks stems from @entity10 , where all genres of music would blast from the brownstones around his neighborhood . and for him , the @entity6 provide the sound of the city , the sound of the streets : cool , dangerous , absolutely self - assured , suffused with menace and gangster swagger . he says , " @entity6 were key ... i was creating scenarios in my head as i listened to their music . " " there is a drive and an authority to their music , and also an edge to it , " he continues . " i 've used @entity106 twice now in my pictures . " ( it 's left to @entity17 to joke that @entity16 is the first @entity11 film not to feature the track . ) so when @entity17 decided he wanted a film of their live performance , who better to call . " it 's good to start at the top , " he says . initially , guitarist @entity116 was reluctant to go ahead with the film . he told @entity2 , " i would n't have done this . they said , ' we wan na shoot a show , ' and i said , ' yeah , so ? ' " but @entity18 , a film buff and longtime fan of @entity11 's work , could n't resist the chance to be shot by the director . " you go , whoah , " he said . " you ca n't f * * * around with him . i wanted to see what @entity11 saw in the @entity6 . " and @entity11 's response ? one word : " absolutely . " but @entity17 's idea for the movie centered around the @entity6 ' biggest ever concert , in @entity135 . @entity11 was n't convinced that the @entity137 beach extravaganza would hit the right note . " i wanted to capture the music and their interaction on stage , i wanted people to feel like they were with them in the real film , " he explains . eventually he persuaded @entity17 to forego the @entity135 beach gig for a double date at @entity10 's @entity9 . on the night of the performance , we see @entity11 's painstaking preparation come up against the monster of spontaneity that is the @entity6 live . as the clock ticks towards curtain time , the filmmaker still does n't have the final set - list , and is getting jittery . " it felt like the last minute . it may actually have been an hour or so , " he recalls . but as the song goes , you ca n't always get what you want : @entity11 had to place his faith in his meticulous planning , and the hope that he would be able to respond to the performers -- @entity17 especially -- on the night . @entity11 believes that the band 's live performances are the key to their long - lived success . " the way they work off of each other and off of the audience ... it 's fascinating to see that kind of power , " he explains . " they cast a spell , something primal but very orchestrated . " when it came to the edit , @entity11 ditched any thought of talking - head interviews , choosing instead to splice vintage tv / archive footage between the live shots . that puts the focus firmly on the music , while underlining the @entity6 ' longevity . so where does " @entity16 " stand in relation to other rockumentary greats ? sure enough , it 's not @entity6 : the spectacle , @entity17 's original concept . this is an intimate and illuminating look at the relationships in rock ' n ' roll 's greatest band . it pays tribute to their longevity , highlights their rich repertoire and shows how , forty years on , their live shows still crackle with energy . and while fans will decide whether @entity11 has fulfilled his aim to make " something that 's as close as possible to a live performance , " @entity116 believes @entity11 got the gold . " he captured what we do , " he told @entity2 . " we are what we are . we 're a rock ' n ' roll band .

@placeholder leaders now have a 13 - point advantage over @entity10 and @entity13	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 marched 13 points clear in the @entity4 @entity3 on saturday with a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity7 . coach @entity9 's team later saw defending champions @entity10 move up to second place on goal difference above @entity13 , who host lowly @entity15 on sunday . @entity17 striker @entity16 scored his 10th goal this season to put @entity1 ahead six minutes before halftime , while an own - goal from @entity22 four minutes after the break left @entity7 just five points above the relegation zone . @entity16 netted for the first time this year after doing well to control @entity28 's cross , and his ball across goal forced @entity22 to turn the ball into his own net with @entity33 waiting behind him to score . it was a welcome return to winning ways for @entity1 , who had drawn three of the team 's first five games of 2011 . @entity10 warmed up for wednesday 's @entity41 final rematch against @entity42 with a morale - boosting 3 - 1 win over @entity45 , who stayed in fifth place . @entity48 scored the first header of his @entity3 career nine minutes into the first half and @entity52 made it 2 - 0 five minutes into the second , with @entity55 winger @entity54 involved in setting up both goals . with 13 minutes left , @entity52 helped @entity58 striker @entity57 to score his 27th goal in all competitions this season for @entity63 's team , who travel to @entity65 seeking revenge for may 's defeat in @entity68 . @entity70 striker @entity69 headed his second goal in successive games in the 83rd minute , but it was too late for @entity45 -- who won in @entity75 in september . fourth - placed @entity76 moved four points clear of @entity45 with a 3 - 1 win over struggling @entity79 , with a goal in each half from @entity82 and another just before the interval by @entity84 . the defeat left visiting @entity79 third from bottom on goal difference behind 2009 champions @entity89 , who lost 2 - 1 at sixth - placed @entity91 . @entity89 led when @entity93 striker @entity92 helped set up fellow new signing @entity94 , but substitute @entity96 leveled just before halftime and @entity99 's 69th - minute winner was his 16th goal this season . @entity102 claimed seventh place above @entity104 -- 3 - 0 winners over @entity106 on friday -- following a crushing 4 - 0 victory at home to @entity109 . @entity111 striker @entity110 gave @entity102 the lead three minutes before halftime , then two bad second - half mistakes by @entity114 gave @entity117 striker @entity116 a double on the counter-attack before @entity120 sealed victory near the end . the defeat left @entity109 just a point above @entity89 and @entity79 . @entity125 came from behind to draw 1 - 1 at ninth - placed @entity126 , moving three points clear of the drop zone as @entity130 's 69th - minute equalizer canceled out an own - goal by teammate @entity132 soon after the interval .	@entity22:Gunesch	@entity99:Papiss Demba Cisse	@entity28:Nuri Sahin	@entity15:Stuttgart	@entity117:Peru	@entity116:Paolo Guerrero	@entity82:Jan Schlaudraff	@entity114:Per Mertesacker	@entity84:Mohammed Abdellaoue	@entity111:Croatian	@entity110:Mladen Petric	@entity89:Wolfsburg	@entity130:Youssef Mohamad	@entity132:Milivoje Novakovic	@entity3:Bundesliga	@entity1:Borussia Dortmund	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:St. Pauli	@entity4:German	@entity9:Jurgen Klopp	@entity52:Muller	@entity57:Mario Gomez	@entity91:Freiburg	@entity55:Dutch	@entity54:Arjen Robben	@entity75:Munich	@entity79:Kaiserslautern	@entity58:Germany	@entity70:Tunisian	@entity96:Stefan Reisinger	@entity17:Paraguay	@entity16:Barrios	@entity33:Robert Lewandowski	@entity13:Bayer Leverkusen	@entity42:Inter Milan	@entity10:Bayern	@entity102:Hamburg	@entity104:Nuremberg	@entity106:Eintracht Frankfurt	@entity126:Hoffenheim	@entity109:Bremen	@entity125:Cologne	@entity93:Turkey	@entity92:Tuncay Sanli	@entity120:Anis Ben-Hatira	@entity76:Hanover	@entity45:Mainz	@entity41:Champions League	@entity68:Madrid	@entity69:Sami Allagui	@entity94:Patrick Helmes	@entity65:Italy	@entity48:Bastian Schweinsteiger	@entity63:Louis van Gaal
counter-terrorism policies live on the edge of international law , @placeholder writes	@entity192	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 's claim that terrorists " can run but they ca n't hide " following two operations in @entity6 over the weekend is a reminder that @entity3 's military is increasingly active on the continent . it also raises questions about the international legality of such operations , and their long - term impact , especially in weak @entity17 states . in some cases @entity3 military engagements in @entity6 have already caused further instability rather than reducing the risks for international peace and security ? read more : should @entity3 fear @entity25 ? the @entity28 's @entity27 seizure of alleged @entity30 leader @entity29 , who was born @entity31 , in @entity32 is significant for @entity3 counter-terrorism efforts . a few months ago , president @entity34 and former president @entity35 attended a memorial service in @entity37 on the anniversary of the 1998 bombings of the @entity3 embassies in @entity41 and @entity42 that killed more than 220 people . @entity44 was allegedly the mastermind behind these bombings and has been one of the @entity3 's wanted men for the last 15 years . a second @entity3 military operation by @entity49 in @entity50 was aimed at capturing @entity52 militant leader said to be @entity53 , who also goes by @entity54 , the leader of @entity55 , the group that claimed responsibility for last month 's attack on the @entity59 shopping mall in @entity41 . the operation was aborted under heavy armed fire during their amphibious assault . analysis : @entity55 breaks new ground the @entity50 operation is a reminder of how technically difficult such operations are and how accurate @entity3 intelligence needs to be . such operations though fit into a bigger picture of @entity3 and @entity73 counter-terrorism strategy in @entity6 , and how these poorly governed , fragile states provide havens and laboratories for terrorism franchises . listening to the difficulties that the @entity49 encountered in @entity50 , reminded me that october 3 , marked 20 years since 18 @entity3 soldiers and hundreds of @entity50 died in a battle that saw two @entity83 helicopters shot down over @entity84 . this was seen at the time as one of the worst disasters in @entity3 military history . the result in 1993 was that @entity3 and international community left @entity50 to its own fate -- which over two decades has brought it back into the front - line of international counter-terrorism efforts . while the outcome in 1993 was disengagement , @entity3 engagement policy under president @entity35 in @entity50 to remove the @entity95 in late 2006 resulted in deepened radicalization and the rise of @entity55 . similarly @entity73 policy toward @entity32 in 2011 , interpreting a narrow civilian protection @entity100 mandate for pushing for regime change resulted in the instability of @entity32 today , and the knock - on effects in the @entity106 , including the radical islamists capturing northern @entity108 until a @entity110 intervention loosened their hold on power earlier in 2013 . counter-terrorism policies live on the edge of international law : extrajudicial killings by drones or proxy hit squads are clearly contentious and extraordinary renditions -- suspect - grabbing operations -- are unlawful . known extraordinary renditions in @entity6 have occurred in many @entity17 countries , including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , the @entity128 , @entity41 , @entity32 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity42 , @entity50 , @entity6 and @entity132 . the @entity34 administration has not publically stated if such operations continue . today the @entity3 military brief congress with maps showing an arc of instability by @entity52 terrorists from @entity50 and the @entity140 across the @entity106 and @entity141 to the @entity142 and @entity131 . analysis : what 's behind @entity146 's wave of violence ? the mistake would be to regard this as a homogeneous threat . @entity25 in @entity146 is very different from @entity55 , which is different from @entity151 . what is similar is that all these groups thrive in weakened and poorly governed states but the solutions are much more costly and long term : institution building , good governance and job creation . building up professional and accountable @entity17 militaries is only part of the solution and @entity73 efforts in @entity50 in support of the continental body the @entity166 have had success in combatting @entity55 and significantly weakening them , despite the @entity59 attack in @entity41 . it is though also pursuing policies that do not cause greater harm and radicalize further , as @entity3 strategy toward @entity50 in 2006 did and arguably @entity3 , @entity110 and @entity175 policy did toward @entity32 in 2011 . if we are to advocate good governance , and rule of law as the ultimate remedies , we should more assiduously find ways of ensuring our policies are values - led , rather than by interests . not forgetting the lessons learned from @entity50 and @entity32 about the unintended consequences of non-intervention and intervention is important if international efforts to counter terrorism in @entity6 in the long term are to be successful . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .	@entity17:African	@entity27:Delta force	@entity25:Boko Haram	@entity28:U.S. Army	@entity29:Abu Anas al Libi	@entity106:Sahel	@entity83:Black Hawk	@entity84:Mogadishu	@entity110:French	@entity151:AQIM	@entity131:Mauritania	@entity130:Morocco	@entity132:Zimbabwe	@entity3:America	@entity2:John Kerry	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:British	@entity6:Africa	@entity192:Vines	@entity53:Mukhtar Abu Zubayr	@entity52:Islamist	@entity50:Somalia	@entity55:Al-Shabaab	@entity54:Ahmed Abdi Godane	@entity140:Gulf of Aden	@entity59:Westgate	@entity73:Western	@entity31:Nazih Abd al Hamid al Ruqhay	@entity30:al Qaeda	@entity32:Libya	@entity35:George W.

@entity209 : 1,000 @placeholder workers have died since 2006 in factory fires or accidents	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- for workers of @entity2 , the worst kind of tragedy imaginable struck last week when the @entity6 garment factory building -- just outside my home city of @entity9 -- collapsed , killing more than 500 workers . despite the many warnings of dangerous cracks in the walls reported to supervisors , police and the media earlier in the week , thousands were still sent to work on wednesday to proceed with business as usual . there 's no question that this building collapse is tragic , but for garment workers , it 's not surprising . i began working in @entity2 's garment industry at the age of 12 , making just $ 3 a month . i went to work because my father had a stroke and the family needed money to cover basic living expenses . i worked 23 days in a row , sleeping on the shop floor , taking showers in the factory restroom , drinking unsafe water and being slapped by the supervisor . @entity2 vs. the @entity38 : how much does it cost to make a denim shirt ? by the time i was a young woman working at a factory that made clothing for a big @entity38 retailer , i knew the time had come for change . the factory owed my coworkers and me overtime wages , but it wanted to pay us only half of what we had earned , making it even harder for us to support our families . so i helped lead a strike to hold our manager accountable . i was fired and blacklisted , but my work was far from over . i later learned labor law , @entity59 and computer skills so that i could help win justice for garment workers . today i lead a worker education and advocacy nonprofit that counts tens of thousands of garment workers as members . opinion : who really pays for our cheap clothes ? the sad reality is that tragedies like this have become business as usual , advanced by some of the most highly profitable @entity38 and international corporations in the world . last november , 112 workers lost their lives when the @entity80 factory , which produced garments sold by @entity82 , @entity83 and other retailers , caught fire . much like @entity88 's infamous triangle shirtwaist factory fire more than 100 years ago , the workers at @entity80 were trapped inside , with many jumping from upper story windows to try to save themselves . the death toll at @entity2 factories stands at nearly 1,000 since 2006 , based on estimates by the @entity2 government and an advocacy organization . in the case of these two recent tragedies , there is plenty of blame to go around -- from the @entity2 government for looking the other way at safety violations , to the incredibly dangerous circumstances workers face when they try to unionize , to the pressure factory owners and managers are under to turn out high product volume at low prices no matter what . it is the responsibility of the government of @entity2 to make a sustained , concerted effort to rectify the dire situation . strict , well - enforced factory codes and clear support for workers ' rights are paramount to protecting @entity2 's garment workforce . but more tragedies can be prevented only if the multinational corporations and retailers whose goods are produced at these factories are willing to stand up and do what is right . a coalition of labor and non-governmental organizations in @entity2 , @entity128 and the @entity38 has developed a protocol for an innovative two - year inspection and renovation program to finally make these factories safe -- the @entity132 . in addition to facilitating government - supported employer - labor relations and stringent oversight of factory safety management , this protocol focuses on the responsibility of brand owners and retailers to support safety standards . if @entity82 and its fellow retailers that count on @entity2 labor demand change , we can be sure it will happen . as the protocol states , these corporations must verify that the factories they use comply with applicable safety standards . they must ensure that their pricing of garments makes it feasible for the factories to stick to standards . no longer should a @entity2 factory manager feel forced to pressure his employees to work in a deadly environment to meet a corporation 's bottom line . as for the tragedies that have already taken place , these brands should contribute to worker compensation funds for victims and victims ' families , including those in the fire at @entity80 . to date , @entity82 and @entity83 have refused to contribute . both companies maintain that subcontractors had used the factory without their authorization , so they are not responsible . i single out @entity82 because its past actions have been painfully inadequate . @entity82 has refused to sign onto the protocol designed to enhance fire safety and improve factory structures , saying it is putting its own standards in place , which are perfectly adequate . yet those are @entity179 measures that are woefully insufficient . last fall , @entity82 refused to admit its connection to the @entity80 factory until my colleagues and i went there the day after the fire and photographed products with @entity82 's labels in the wreckage . we must no longer tolerate this willful ignorance on the part of multinational corporations about where their goods are produced . it 's high time that companies like @entity82 , @entity194 , and others step up and demand the safety of @entity2 's garment workers . too many @entity2 workers live and work in fear for their lives each day . the fire safety protocol is a critical first step to making real change , and i urge @entity82 to become a leader in the fight to save @entity2 lives . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .	@entity2:Bangladeshi	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Rana Plaza	@entity179:Band-Aid	@entity38:United States	@entity9:Dhaka	@entity194:The Gap	@entity82:Wal-mart	@entity80:Tazreen	@entity209:Akter	@entity83:Sears	@entity128:Europe	@entity88:New York	@entity59:English	@entity132:Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety Agreement
@placeholder and @entity250 dishes typically contain enough food for two or three people	@entity101	( @entity0 ) -- you know a little something about how to order healthy at @entity4 restaurants . brown rice trumps white , summer rolls are lower cal than egg rolls , and you should run from @entity11 's anything . but with the explosion of @entity4 fusion , figuring out what to order can be as murky as a bowl of freshly stirred miso soup . " there are hidden fats and preparation details that can really keep you guessing , " says @entity17 , @entity18 , a spokesperson for the @entity19 . and those unknowns can double , even triple , the calorie count and fat content of a dish . here 's how to dig in without blowing your diet . 1 . edamame is n't automatically low cal before you make an appetizer out of those delicious fiber - packed soybeans , ask how the pods have been prepared . if the answer is that they were simply steamed in water , they 're an excellent pick , but " some places toss them in oil after steaming them , " @entity37 reveals . " so what starts out at 120 calories per half cup becomes 220 . " that may not seem like a lot , but if you 're on a diet , a bowlful could do you in . solution : request they serve ' em with no added oil . @entity0 : everything you need to know about soy 2 . lobster sauce does n't deserve its bad rap it tastes so rich it has to be naughty , right ? actually , at just about 50 calories per quarter - cup , it 's one of the lower - cal sauces . " it 's not laden with sugar like sweet and sour sauce , either , " notes @entity69 , a chef and author of @entity71 . 3 . those light - as - air shrimp chips are n't so light they seem way healthier than old - school crunchy noodles . but do n't be fooled : they 're a mix of deep - fried shrimp and starch , and they 'll set you back more than 200 calories and 14 grams of fat per handful , says @entity85 , @entity18 . she suggests sipping a cup of green tea while you wait for your @entity89 © e. otherwise , you could munch away a meal 's worth of calories and fat before it shows up . @entity0 : dine out like a health pro 4 . veggies are n't always virtuous what could be healthier than ordering a side of green beans ? plenty , if they 're from a @entity101 menu . before stir - frying veggie side dishes , " @entity101 restaurants traditionally deep - fry them for extra texture , " says @entity102 , co-executive chef at @entity103 in @entity104 . what 's more , some veggies absorb oil the way sponges drink in water , explains @entity85 . " eggplant soaks up oil and sauce like no other vegetable , " she says . opt for less sponge - like veggies such as broccoli , snow peas , or peppers . plus , ask them to stir - fry only and go light on the oil . 5 . the same goes for steamed dumplings sure , steaming saves calories , but whether it 's enough to matter depends on what 's inside . a steamed pork dumpling is around 80 calories -- just ten fewer than the pan-fried version . those stuffed with vegetables , on the other hand , are about 35 calories a piece . so if you love the pork version and can stop at one dumpling , go for it . but if you 're , well , only human and tend to enjoy a few at a sitting , try the steamed veggie dumplings -- three will save you more than 130 calories and nearly 10 grams of fat over their steamed pork brethren . bonus : " veggies naturally have a lot less sodium than shrimp or pork , " notes @entity155 , @entity18 , author of " nutrition at your fingertips " . @entity0 : irresistible , healthy @entity4 recipes 6 . stir - fry wo n't derail your diet sure , it 'll cost you more in the calorie department -- a main - dish veggie stir - fry is about 370 calories per serving versus around 140 for its steamed counterpart -- but the pay - off in flavor may be worth it . " steamed vegetables are the best option , but stir - fried is ok too , as long as a minimal amount of oil is used , " says @entity171 , chef and owner of @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , and host of " @entity177 " on @entity178 . plus , you 'll get the added health benefits of ginger , an anti-inflammatory , and garlic , which is loaded with antioxidants . as for that " minimal amount , " just ask them to use as little oil as possible . 7 . the lightest lo mein is n't always veggie it 's often shrimp ! a serving at @entity196 's clocks in with about 30 % less sodium and nearly 200 fewer calories than the veggie version . wondering how vegetables could be the less healthy choice ? see number 4 , above : @entity4 restaurants tend to drown them in sodium - loaded soy sauce and oil to enhance flavor , @entity203 says . @entity0 : @entity210 's healthiest fast food restaurants 8 . tofu takeout can be a diet wrecker not all soy is skinny - making . " some tofu dishes are high in calories because the tofu has been deep - fried before it hits the stir - fry pan , " @entity37 reveals . be sure to ask how it 's prepared , and steer clear if it 's fried or described as " crispy " -- or ask them to use soft or plain tofu instead . 9 . you can have your ( sushi ) crunch and eat it too who needs tempura ? there are waistline - friendlier ways to get the texture you 're craving . " request a sprinkling of chopped peanuts , almonds , or cashews on the inside or outside of your roll , " suggests @entity231 , the corporate culinary manager at @entity233 restaurant group . " or ask for some crispy salmon skin in the roll , " she adds . " you 'll get omega - 3s and really great flavor along with the crunch .

" since returning to the @entity27 following a seven - month injury layoff , he has reached the final in all six of the tournaments he has entered and won four of them , the first man to reach that mark this season . his @entity6 triumph , making it 39 straight wins in the @entity39 capital , has been added to titles in @entity41 , @entity42 and the hard courts at @entity44 . @entity45 denied @entity1 a ninth straight title in @entity3 but sat out the @entity6 event . the pair are set to lock horns again at the @entity50 which starts next weekend as the build - up continues to next month 's @entity52 where @entity1 will be defending his crown . in other @entity27 final action sunday , @entity54 , who stunned @entity1 in the second round at @entity57 last year , claimed his first career title in emotional fashion . the @entity61 beat @entity62 6 - 3 6 - 2 in the @entity64 final and dedicated his victory to his father , who sadly passed away 10 days ago .	@entity3:Monte Carlo	@entity1:Rafael Nadal	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Nicolas Almagro	@entity6:Barcelona Open	@entity45:World No.1 Novak Djokovic	@entity39:Catalan	@entity9:Spaniard	@entity27:ATP	@entity44:Indian Wells	@entity52:French Open	@entity50:Madrid Masters	@entity57:Wimbledon	@entity41:Sao Paulo	@entity42:Acapulco	@entity54:Lukas Rosol	@entity64:Bucharest	@entity62:Guillermo Garcia-Lopez	@entity61:Czech
his new trial date is the same day as ousted president @placeholder 's trial	@entity7	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the much anticipated trial of former @entity4 interior minister @entity3 has been postponed until august 3 -- the same day @entity4 's ousted president is scheduled to stand trial . @entity3 and former @entity4 president @entity7 face charges of killing pro-democracy protesters during the revolution that started six months ago . @entity3 's trial at a @entity0 court was expected to be carried live on state television monday . this is second time the trial was postponed amid frustrations among protesters in @entity18 who demand speedy trials and swift judgments for detained officials from @entity7 's regime . judge @entity23 announced the postponement to a court room packed with people -- many of whom had already learned about the decision on @entity4 @entity30 . " the decision was leaked by the lawyers before the hearing and broadcast before the defendants and judge even entered the court -- which was a big mistake , " said @entity31 , a judicial consultant with the @entity32 . @entity3 appeared with a blue uniform because he had been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges . six of his former assistants , who were also set to stand trial for allegedly killing protesters , appeared in white suits . the authorities asked all journalists to leave the court except for @entity4 tv staff in charge of broadcasting the trial . " do they expect us to believe that @entity7 will appear with @entity3 in two weeks at a court when he has been in @entity58 for six months ? " said @entity52 , an activist and son of presidential candidate @entity54 . the 83 - year - old ex-ruler fell into a coma earlier this month , @entity7 lawyer @entity59 told @entity1 . he later regained consciousness , said @entity63 , the head of the @entity58 facility where @entity7 was recuperating . @entity31 said @entity7 and @entity3 are expected to be tried in the coastal city due to security issues . more than 800 protesters were killed during the @entity4 revolution when pro-democracy protests forced @entity7 to step down on february 11 . @entity1 's @entity70 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Habib El Adly	@entity23:Adel Abdel Salam Gomaa	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Cairo	@entity7:Hosni Mubarak	@entity4:Egyptian	@entity59:Farid El Deeb	@entity18:Tahrir Square	@entity52:Noor Noor	@entity32:Ministry of Justice	@entity86:El Adly	@entity54:Ayman Noor	@entity30:State TV	@entity58:Sharm el-Sheikh	@entity31:Hassan	@entity70:Amir Ahmed	@entity63:Mohamed Fathalla
@placeholder : only problem would be pedestrians would use them to flee the yakkers out on the street	@entity213	( @entity0 ) -- here 's a free idea that will make some businessperson millions of dollars . go ahead and take it -- it 's yours . you 'll be doing a service to humankind . in addition to all the money you 'll make , you may very well end up with the @entity9 , with the thanks of a grateful world . this is no joke . the idea ? bring back phone booths . you 're already saying : what ? phone booths ? who uses pay phones anymore ? no one said anything about pay phones . the idea is to put up phone booths -- all right , technically , phoneless booths -- in public places around the country . the old - style phone booths , with doors that close , and ventilator fans in the ceilings . either the ones made out of metal and glass that were seen on street corners for generations , or the elegant ones made out of dark wood and glass that were seen in the lobbies of office buildings and in the backs of drugstores . phone booths were a wonderfully democratic invention , intended to shut out the noise of the immediate outside world so the person in the booth could privately , in silence , talk with someone miles away . are you starting to see where we 're going with this ? the new phone booths would n't have pay telephones inside . but they would be the solution to one of society 's most constantly irritating problems . you ca n't escape the yammering all around you -- the people walking down the street blabbing at high volume into their cell phones . the cell phones , of course , are the primary reason that pay telephones are increasingly hard to find . with so many people carrying their own phones , telephone companies have been deciding that it was uneconomical to maintain pay phones . and here is where the idea comes in . if there were clean , convenient , phone ( less ) booths readily available , do n't you think that people would step into them to make their cell phone calls ? who would n't opt for privacy and quiet if it was there for them to take ? a savvy entrepreneur could finance the project by selling advertising space both outside and -- especially -- inside the new phone booths , whether on the streets , in malls , restaurants -- anywhere that people gather . national advertisers would literally have a captive audience . the person in the booth would have no choice but to stare at the advertising . cities and municipalities would love it , too . they could negotiate the rights to a percentage of the advertising fees for the booths on the streets , perhaps in exchange for having city workers help keep the booths clean . there is a business precedent for this : in some cities , private firms have erected shelters at bus stops , with advertising displayed on the walls . the bus riders do n't object to seeing the ads while they wait -- they 're just glad to be able to get out of the storm . the storm from which the new phone booths would provide relief is the storm of words that has overtaken public places . advertisers face a vexing set of decisions these days because with so many media outlets -- hundreds of cable channels , millions of websites , consumers thumbing through screen after screen on their handheld devices -- it can be difficult to determine how best to reach potential customers . the new phone booths would be goldmines -- places guaranteed to deliver the advertising message to a person willingly enclosed inside . sort of like the isolation booths on the old quiz shows . there would be challenges : the phone booths would have to be absolutely transparent on all four sides ; otherwise people could set up housekeeping inside , could use the booths as private dining rooms , could have quick romantic encounters . but technology could make a virtue of that necessity . while people on the outside could look in , the person on the inside could be surrounded by advertising messages electronically delivered onto only one side -- the interior side -- of the window - walls . the trick would be to manufacture enough of the new booths . once the first ones went up , people would want more . it 's hard to even remember the days when phone booths were ubiquitous in @entity178 ; well before the advent of cell phones , the four - walls - and - a - ceiling booths had largely been replaced by bolted - to - a - wall units that just featured pay phones without the benefit of much privacy . but that was in a different world , one in which people did not walk through life jabbering loudly into tiny phones . the one drawback to the new phone booths might be that the people who use them the most could turn out to be not cell phone callers trying to be courteous to their fellow pedestrians , but those beleaguered fellow pedestrians themselves , seeking to escape the rude babblers . @entity200 used to duck into phone booths to change into his @entity204 uniform . today , @entity204 himself might be tempted to duck into the new phone booths just to flee in abject annoyance from all the relentlessly loud yakkers outside . even the @entity209 has his breaking point . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .	@entity0:CNN	@entity213:Greene	@entity178:America	@entity9:Nobel Peace Prize	@entity209:Man of Steel	@entity200:Clark Kent	@entity204:Superman

@placeholder threatens to kill survey used for health coverage data	@entity42	( @entity0 ) -- americans needing health insurance or disability services could be overlooked by their local governments if a bill now being considered by the @entity6 passes . it would eliminate a survey that some call a vital source of information about health indicators of millions of @entity1 , but which @entity14 @entity13 say is too expensive and raises privacy concerns . it 's called the @entity18 . the @entity19 surveys about a quarter of a million @entity1 every month . community officials , academics and businesses rely on this information to understand the markets they operate in and the needs of individual localities . the @entity14 last week passed a @entity13 - backed bill that would cut the survey altogether , citing costs and privacy issues . the survey program , which reaches more than 3 million people annually , could cost taxpayers upwards of $ 2.4 billion over the next 10 years . survey supporters say that is n't much money in the grand scheme of government , but opponents say the survey is needless and unconstitutional . " given the intrusive nature of some of these questions , which are mandatory for @entity1 to answer under penalty of law , it would seem that these questions hardly fit the scope of what was intended or required by the @entity51 , " rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , told @entity42 last week . but the @entity18 is vital to state legislators , mayors , city councils and city planners , said @entity56 , professor of economics at @entity58 in @entity59 . these officials need to know information such as how many families do n't have health insurance , how many people are living in poverty , and how many individuals are disabled , so that services can be directed toward the appropriate number of people in particular places , he said . academics who rely on the data for research have been particularly concerned about maintaining the survey , whose data is used in a wide variety of analyses . " if you 're opposed to the survey , you 're opposed to understanding what 's going on in @entity1 , " said @entity81 economist @entity80 , director of the program on @entity83 at the @entity84 . the poverty question is particularly important because in areas where poor families are concentrated , problems multiply , and community officials should know where those areas are , @entity56 said . high crime , health conditions and underperforming public schools are all consequences of poverty clusters , according to the @entity100 . and with health insurance , as communities devise health insurance programs for those who are not covered , it 's useful to know exactly where the uninsured live and other facts about them , such as whether they are also unemployed , @entity56 said . @entity80 says the survey is probably the best source of data on health insurance coverage currently available . health insurance markets are quite different across areas . the survey additionally allows researchers and policy - makers to look for trends among minorities . " if you want to do any local estimates , you need big samples , and that 's what the @entity18 gets you , " he said . the @entity126 , whose constitutionality will be decided by the @entity129 , would require that everyone have health insurance . but irrespective of that , any state doing health care exchanges needs to know about the markets it 's operating in , he said . in 2008 the @entity18 began including questions about marriage -- for instance , how many times people have been married , and whether they have been married , divorced or widowed in the previous 12 months . this could be used to zoom in on needs surrounding child care and child support for single - parent households , as well as to create and evaluate policies and initiatives relating to the institution of marriage . the survey is also important to businesses . @entity151 , director of market analytics and planning at @entity154 , said in a video on the @entity19 website that her company uses @entity19 data to see the characteristics of potential customers who live in communities throughout the @entity1 . @entity154 's director of guest insight , @entity164 , said in the video that @entity154 looks at the @entity18 for information about family structure and household size . educational attainment and workforce age are two statistics from the survey that are valuable to the @entity172 , a nonprofit geared toward building economic prosperity in @entity174 . as examples of the intrusiveness of the survey , @entity40 cited questions that ask if respondents have difficulty dressing , concentrating and making decisions , how long it takes them to get home from work , and what their emotional condition is . he also said that failure to answer the survey can result in a $ 5,000 fine . but @entity188 , professor of economics and public policy at @entity190 , called concerns about privacy " very foolish . " " people volunteer all kinds of far more intimate , sensitive information online without a thought about who is watching , " he said . and there 's a harsher penalty for @entity19 employees who identify individuals filling out the surveys : five years in prison or $ 250,000 in fines , or both , according to the @entity19 website . all employees take an oath of nondisclosure , and the information is kept private . the @entity18 has been administered since 2005 . before that , there was a long - form questionnaire that accompanied the general @entity1 census , which is given out every 10 years . " there was a general sense in the statistical community that there was a burden and people objected to it , " said @entity214 , professor of history at the @entity216 . supporters of the cost - cutting bill won the vote to kill the survey 232 - 190 in the @entity14 . but it 's far from being a law -- the @entity6 has n't voted on it yet , and @entity14 has suggested it would veto such a bill . " i think the issue really is : the @entity13 @entity14 right now is looking for ways to cut the federal budget , " @entity232 said . " what 's likely to happen is : there 's now going to be a much more robust public debate about whether ( cutting it ) is prudent or not .

number of @placeholder , residents older than 65 expected to more than double	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- by 2050 , minorities will be the majority in @entity3 , and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double , according to projections released thursday by the @entity7 . the @entity7 looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and migration . minorities , classified as those of any race other than @entity17 , single - race whites , currently constitute about a third of the @entity3 population , according to @entity7 figures . but by 2042 , they are projected to become the majority , making up more than half the population . by 2050 , 54 percent of the population will be minorities . minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner . by 2023 , the bureau said , more than half of all children will be minorities . " part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups , hispanics in particular , " said @entity29 , chief of the @entity7 's population projection branch , which issued the report . " those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age . non-hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older . " the projections are based on @entity46 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and net international migration , the bureau said . the group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the @entity54 population . it is projected to nearly triple , from 46.7 million to 132.8 million , from 2008 through 2050 , the bureau said . its share of the total @entity3 population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent . " thus , one in three @entity3 residents would be @entity54 , " the @entity7 said in a news release . the @entity61 - @entity3 population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050 , going from 14 percent of the @entity3 population to 15 percent . the @entity62 - @entity3 population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million , or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population . among the remaining races , the bureau said , @entity3 @entity65 and @entity66 natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million , going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the @entity3 population . native @entity70 and @entity69 are expected to more than double , increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million . in addition , the number of @entity3 residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple , increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million , the @entity7 said . meanwhile , the @entity17 white population is not expected to post dramatic gains in the same period . by 2050 , whites are expected to number 203.3 million , slightly increased from the 2008 number of 199.8 million . whites will comprise 46 percent of the @entity3 population by 2050 , down from the current level of 66 percent , the bureau said , as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s . by 2030 , all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of @entity3 residents , or one in five @entity3 , the bureau said . by 2050 , the 65 - and - older age group will increase to 88.5 million , more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million . meanwhile , the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple , from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050 . non-hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers , @entity29 said . " they 're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster " instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities . obviously , the projections will have " very strong policy implications , " he said -- medical care for an increasingly elderly population , for instance , educational needs for increasing numbers of minority children and economic effects for the labor force . " who 's going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people ? " @entity29 said . " all those things are subject to change . " the @entity3 is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039 , according to bureau projections . by 2050 , the population is expected to be 439 million . of those , 235.7 million are expected to be minorities . as @entity3 cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse , @entity7 officials knew the day of a majority minority would come , @entity29 said . and " the aging one is sort of simple , " he added . " that 's demography 101 . " other highlights from the report released thursday : by 2050 , 62 percent of the nation 's children will be minorities , up from 44 percent today . of those , 39 percent are projected to be @entity54 , up from 22 percent in 2008 , and 38 percent are projected to be white , down from 56 percent in 2008 the percentage of the @entity3 population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the " working age " population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008 . the working - age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039 , and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population . by 2050 , the working - age population will be more than 30 percent @entity54 , up from 15 percent in 2008 ; 15 percent @entity61 , up from 13 percent in 2008 ; and 9.6 percent @entity62 , up from 5.3 percent in 2008 . @entity29 said the timelines are not written in stone . " it 's a projection . and things like the baby boom generation could n't be predicted . " @entity150 changes in policy affecting families and children , or a major policy affecting immigration , could have an impact on the expectations , he said . the nation 's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections , @entity29 said . @entity7 data includes all @entity3 residents , regardless of their legal status , he said . @entity0 's @entity164 contributed to this report .	@entity3:U.S	@entity17:non-Hispanic	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Census	@entity164:Ashley Broughton	@entity29:Waddington	@entity65:Indians	@entity70:Hawaiian	@entity46:Census 2000	@entity69:Pacific Islanders	@entity66:Alaska	@entity150:Major	@entity62:Asian	@entity54:Hispanic	@entity61:African-American
research : 18.4 percent of 4 - year - olds in the @placeholder are obese .	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- nearly one - fifth of @entity2 4 - year - olds are obese , and children of color are at higher risk , according to new research . obese children are at risk for early onset of diabetes , fatty liver and musculoskeletal problems . researchers calculated the body mass index from a sample of 8,550 @entity18 , black , white , @entity17 and native american 4 - year - olds . the children were born in 2001 , and in 2005 , their height and weight were measured -- 18.4 percent of them were obese . " significant differences in the prevalence of obesity between racial / ethnic groups were evident at 4 years of age , " the researchers wrote in the april issue of the @entity24 . using body mass index , they found that 31.2 percent of @entity34 / @entity33 , 22 percent of @entity35 , 20.8 percent of blacks , 15.9 percent of whites and 12.8 percent of @entity32 were obese . " it 's surprising that there are large differences by racial / ethnic group by that age , " said @entity37 , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the @entity39 and lead study author . @entity46 and co-author @entity47 's analysis showed that children were becoming obese even before encountering soda and candy vending machines in schools . " these results really do point to the need for us to focus attention on early childhood and the need for research to understand how these differences can emerge so early , " @entity46 said . " to do that , we may need to understand the different family and cultural factors that are at play in these children 's lives . " the cause for the early health disparities is hard to pinpoint , childhood obesity experts said . " it 's always possible there are biological factors within ethnic groups , " said dr. @entity69 , director of the @entity70 at the @entity71 . " we know most of the changes that have occurred in body fat tend to occur from being in an environment that promotes very easy access to high - caloric foods and limited opportunities for physical activities . " @entity83 , an associate professor of pediatrics at @entity85 , called the disparities between ethnic groups disturbing . " the expectations , lifestyle , behaviors are different on a cultural and socioeconomic basis , " he said . " kids who live in the inner city , whose neighborhoods are perceived as dangerous , stay at home more , sit more , eat more snacks , because that 's all they can get at the local bodega . there are no supermarkets to get produce . that 's what mom is eating , so that 's what kid is eating . what we 're dealing with here is whole life issues . " previous research has shown that older children are becoming less active and spending more time in front of a computer or tv . " that is displacing physical activity , " said dr. @entity116 , director of the @entity117 at @entity118 in @entity119 . " you can imagine strollers , less outdoor play -- all those kinds of things that have shifted how much activity younger kids are getting . at the same time , portion sizes are increasing for everybody . " according to data from the @entity133 , adults fare no better . approximately 45 percent of blacks , 36.8 percent of @entity134 and 30 percent of whites are obese . " it 's a very bad sign if we see obesity at a young age , " @entity69 said . " when we see children obese at age 4 , we 're likely to see complications -- high blood pressure , abnormal lipids -- which can lead to heart disease and stroke , diabetes in children . " diseases commonly seen in 40 - or 50 - year - olds are presenting in 6 - and 7 - year - olds . obese children are developing type 2 diabetes , fatty liver disease and musculoskeletal problems , which occur because their bodies ca n't carry that much weight , doctors said . calculate your child 's body mass index . " the heavier you are as a child , the likelier that extra weight will follow you through life , " @entity69 said . " that 's why we see adolescents who need weight - loss surgery , because they have life - threatening complications from obesity . " if you have an obese child ... the first step is for the parents to acknowledge that the child is overweight , instead of making excuses or comparing him or her to heavier children . many of the parents of obese children are overweight themselves , which makes that acknowledgment difficult , said @entity83 , who is also director of the @entity182 at @entity118 in @entity183 . " while it 's important to focus on it and take it seriously , it 's also important not to give up or feel hopeless , " he said . " then you wo n't try . you want to look at it for what it is and not be defeated by it . " when you 're trying to help your child achieve a healthy weight , remove the stigma attached to obesity . " it should always be about health , not about losing weight , " @entity83 said . " you 're trying to build the positive . " he recommended the 5 - 2 - 1 - 0 plan . eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables , cut screen time down to two hours or less , exercise at least one hour , and have zero soda and sugary drinks . such changes , which are not seismic shifts to lifestyles , can help the child get into a health weight .

if approved by the @entity23 , the bill will go to @placeholder to be signed into law	@entity25	( @entity0 ) -- lawmakers in @entity3 moved friday to ban @entity4 from adopting @entity6 children , passing a bill that imposes a series of sanctions on @entity4 interests , state media reported . @entity6 is one of the top countries of origin for international adoptions in the @entity4 . the @entity18 , @entity6 's lower house of parliament , adopted the bill on its third reading , the state - run @entity16 news agency reported . the measure will now move to the @entity23 and , if approved there , will go to president @entity25 to be signed into law , the news agency said . read more : @entity6 lawmakers eye adoption ban to @entity4 the legislation could affect hundreds of @entity4 families seeking to adopt @entity6 children . it also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity4 , if such activities may affect @entity6 interests , the news agency said , and imposes sanctions against @entity4 officials thought to have violated human rights . the move by @entity6 politicians is widely seen as retaliation for a law that @entity4 president @entity44 signed december 14 . that bill , called the @entity46 , imposes @entity4 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity6 . " the @entity4 is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the @entity18 today that , if it becomes law , would halt inter-country adoptions between the @entity4 and @entity6 and would restrict the ability of @entity6 civil society organizations to work with @entity4 partners , " @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said . the @entity61 act is named in honor of @entity6 lawyer @entity63 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state . @entity63 died in 2009 after a year in a @entity3 detention center , apparently beaten to death . @entity6 leaders have criticized the bill , which also places sanctions on those involved in the tax fraud @entity63 uncovered and those responsible for his detention , abuse , and death . the bill passed by the @entity18 is named in turn after @entity83 , a 2 - year - old boy who died while in the care of a @entity4 adoptive family , @entity16 said . its implementation would nullify a recent agreement between the @entity4 and @entity6 in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions . " @entity4 families have welcomed more than 60,000 @entity6 children into @entity4 homes over the past 20 years , " @entity50 said . " just last month we implemented a bilateral adoptions agreement with @entity6 to improve safeguards for adopted children and their families . if @entity6 officials have concerns about the implementation of this agreement , we stand ready to work with them to improve it and remain committed to supporting inter-country adoptions between our two countries . " only @entity107 has more adoptions to the @entity4 than @entity6 . backers of the @entity6 bill said @entity4 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing 19 deaths of @entity6 children by their adoptive parents since the 1990s , according to local media . in 2010 , an @entity4 woman caused outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity6 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made the family fear for its safety . @entity124 called on @entity6 lawmakers thursday to reject their measure , which it said would " have a chilling effect on human rights defenders and civil society " and end adoptions to the @entity4 . " there is a huge risk that the vaguely worded provisions in this bill will be used to clamp down on government critics and exposers of abuses . indeed this would appear to be its real purpose , " said @entity139 , @entity124 's @entity140 and @entity142 program director . " this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity46 , " he said . " the @entity18 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity6 civil society and not weaken it .

scientists at the @placeholder are working to create a permanent artificial heart	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- the human heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute , more than 86,000 times a day , 35 million times a year . a single beat pushes about 6 tablespoons of blood through the body . an organ that works that hard is bound to fail , says dr. @entity8 , a heart surgeon at the @entity10 . and he 's right . heart failure is the leading cause of death in men and women , killing more than 600,000 @entity16 every year . for a lucky few , a heart transplant will add an average of 10 years to their lives . for others , technology that assists a failing heart -- called " bridge - to - transplant " devices -- will keep them alive as they wait for a donor heart . unfortunately , more often than not , the new heart does n't arrive in time . that 's why @entity8 and his mentor -- veteran heart surgeon @entity31 -- are working to develop a long - term , artificial replacement for the failing human heart . unlike existing short - term devices that emulate the beating organ , the new machine would propel blood through the body at a steady pace so that its recipients will have no heartbeat at all . the concept of a pulseless heart is difficult to fathom . @entity8 often compares it to the development of the airplane propeller . when people started to develop flying machines , he says , they first tried to emulate the way birds fly -- by flapping the wings aggressively . " it was n't until they decided , ' we ca n't do this the way @entity60 did , ' and came up with the rapidly spinning propeller that the @entity62 were able to fly , " @entity8 says . the idea of an artificial heart goes back decades . @entity31 began medical school in what he describes as " the @entity67 . " " we were going to the moon ; we were going to achieve world peace , " and @entity31 wanted to develop the first artificial heart . in 1968 , he left for @entity72 as a flight surgeon . thirteen months later , his helicopter was shot down , and he nearly died . " that experience convinced me i should stick to something more meaningful for the rest of my life . " that he did . the veteran surgeon , inventor and researcher has devoted the last half century to developing technologies to fix or replace the human heart , the most notable of which is the newest generation of continuous flow @entity87 , known as @entity89 . modeled after an @entity90 , a machine that raises water to fill irrigation ditches , the continuous flow @entity87 is a pump that helps failing hearts push additional blood through the body with a rapidly spinning impeller . today , the continuous flow @entity87 has been implanted in 20,000 people worldwide , including former vice president @entity100 before he received a heart transplant nearly two years later . in some cases , the @entity87 's turbine has essentially taken over the pumping process entirely from the biological heart . in these instances , the implant recipient barely has any pulse at all . observing what happened in these patients led @entity31 to one compelling question : if the @entity87 can take over for a weakened heart , could it replace the organ entirely ? in 2004 , @entity31 asked @entity8 to collaborate on a new research project . @entity8 's interest in heart surgery dates back to when he was a young boy reading articles about world - renowned heart surgeons dr. @entity121 and dr. @entity122 , who developed and played a role in the transplant of the first artificial heart in a human in 1969 . now the holder of some 70 - odd @entity16 patents , @entity8 says his work with @entity31 to build an artificial heart is the most ambitious project of his career . the surgeons set out to combine two @entity134 to replicate the functions of the heart 's right and left ventricles . using two commercially available @entity87 turbines , @entity31 and @entity8 combined the devices with plastics and other material used for implants : hernia mesh , @entity146 cardiovascular patches and medical silicone . everything met @entity150 standards , but @entity8 describes the final product as " rather kludged together . " the surgeons tested their invention by installing it in around 70 calves . all of the cows produced a flat line on an ekg , which measures heart electrical activity , yet they stood , ate and walked around , paying seemingly no notice to a small technicality : they had no heartbeat . in order for the @entity150 to approve the device for clinical trials , the calves needed to live for at least one month . @entity8 and @entity31 's device trumped these standards , with many calves living healthily for full 90 - day studies . @entity8 and @entity31 were encouraged , and in march 2011 , put their artificial heart into a human patient . @entity175 , 55 , was admitted to the @entity10 with amyloidosis , a rare autoimmune disease that fills internal organs with a viscous protein that causes rapid heart , kidney and liver failure . without some intervention , @entity175 would have been dead in days . @entity31 and @entity8 decided it was the right moment to test their device and the surgeons undertook the lengthy procedure . less than 48 hours later , @entity175 was sitting up , talking and using his laptop . when doctors put the stethoscope to @entity175 's heart , all they heard was a steady whir of what sounded like a boat propeller . @entity175 survived for six weeks until his failing kidneys and liver got the best of him and his family asked doctors to unplug the device . @entity175 's case proved what @entity31 and @entity8 had dreamed of for nearly half a century : humans can indeed survive without a pulse . but there are some potential downsides to having a heart that does n't beat . @entity210 , ceo of the first - ever @entity150 approved mechanical artificial heart , the @entity212 , says beating " up the blood in a blender " can activate internal bleeding in other organs . gastrointestinal bleeding and strokes are a high risk for patients on other heart assist devices , he says . @entity8 describes the @entity212 , which has been transplanted in nearly 1,300 people to date as a " brilliant and elegant device , " but the device is for short - term use only and is cumbersome . patients " have to carry around a compressor and have two air hoses going in and out of your chest . " @entity31 and @entity8 see a pulseless device as the only compromise to develop an artificial heart that is both efficient and long - term . two years ago , @entity234 , a 35 - year - old @entity235 biomedical engineer , made an @entity235 government funded trip to @entity238 , stumbling through the door of @entity8 's office at the @entity10 . @entity234 was wearing blue jeans and a t - shirt and carrying a heart device he had been working on for the past 10 years in his backpack . @entity8 was skeptical at first : " a lot of people come to our door with devices and prototypes , and they range from moderately interesting to laughably stupid . ... my expectations were very low . he pulls this thing out and starts telling me about it , and i quickly realized this is the most sophisticated and elegant device i 've ever seen . " made up of one moving part that rotates within a can - like exterior no bigger than a fist , the device has a large and small blade on opposing sides of the rotor . the small blade pushes blood through the heart 's right chamber , to the lungs , and the larger blade pumps out blood through the left chamber to the rest of the body . what fascinated the two surgeons most was that the device operates by being suspended in a powerful magnetic field , which prevents the wear and tear common in technology designed for pumping blood . two magnetic fields also control the blades ' oscillations , which each rotate an average of 2,000 times a minute depending on whether a person is standing , sitting up , exercising or coughing . stats show cpr often falls flat the excitement over the technology drew a $ 2.4 million donation from @entity238 furniture store owner , @entity290 , allowing @entity234 and a team of seven researchers from @entity235 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 to relocate to @entity238 in january to collaborate with the @entity10 . @entity234 ' group also brought a 3 - d printer , which enables the medical staff to quickly make its own parts for the artificial heart . within days , the doctors can print a new part that pumps the blood and then can evaluate its performance , a process that once took months . in july , the doctors even tried a plastic @entity308 printed version on a calf . the calf survived for a number of days and was able to move around . they 're now working on a titanium version of the device as a prototype for a more durable technology . once that device is developed , they will begin animal testing , measuring the results to determine whether the technology is ready to propose implanting into terminally ill human patients . if all goes well , @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity234 would be able to submit the device for @entity150 approval within the next few years . @entity31 believes this artificial heart will save a lot of patients he loses today , particularly those who suffer from premature heart failure . " this is not something ready for prime - time yet , " he says , but for those suffering now " we hope to give them hope .

" our focus is now and will remain the @entity0 people . we have worked closely with local @entity11 government officials and many tribal and local leaders in the detailed planning of this major offensive , " said @entity60 . gen. @entity65 , commander of @entity23 . once security is established , civil affairs personnel and other nongovernmental groups and agencies can come in and establish programs . however , @entity9 control of the countryside is so extensive in provinces such as @entity11 and @entity74 to the east that security forces face a tough job , according to a report this week in the @entity79 . the government has no involvement in five of @entity11 's 13 districts , the report said . in the fighting that began thursday , @entity4 fired 20 mm cannons from their @entity86 helicopter gunships -- but dropped no bombs -- to avoid the higher risk of civilian casualties , the @entity4 source said . the source called resistance " heavy " and " persistent " but intermittent . militants responded using small arms , rocket - propelled grenades and machine guns .

@placeholder suggested @entity22 media had organized campaign to discredit him	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 's parliament voted tuesday to impeach interior minister @entity4 for listing a fake doctorate degree on his resume . @entity4 said someone duped him by saying he could earn the degree by writing an article . the vote unfolded amid political intrigue , with some analysts suggesting that opponents of @entity1 president @entity14 are trying to trigger a vote of confidence in the government by impeaching the interior minister . in a lengthy speech during the impeachment debate tuesday morning , @entity4 suggested the @entity22 news media had organized the campaign to discredit him . he claimed he did not realize that his purported @entity24 from @entity26 's @entity25 was not real . he also said someone duped him by saying he could earn the degree by writing an article . there were 188 votes for impeachment , 45 against and 14 abstentions . @entity14 , who promoted @entity4 to be the interior minister in august , has backed him , calling the impeachment illegal . he told @entity1 's @entity35 that his minister 's educational credentials should not make a difference . " i do not care for a torn up piece of paper ( degree ) . what i care about is my ministers ' job performance and experience , " @entity14 said . @entity14 's representative was banned from the parliament amid allegations that he tried to bribe some members and forged others ' signatures on a petition that said they had withdrawn their support for the impeachment . @entity14 then fired his representative . although it is difficult to confirm details of political machinations in @entity0 , some have suggested that @entity14 's opponents were using the impeachment in a strategy to destabilize @entity14 's administration ahead of june 's presidential election . if @entity4 resigns , he will be the 10th minister in @entity14 's cabinet to leave the government for various reasons . @entity4 is considered a close ally of @entity1 's parliament speaker , @entity69 . he served as his deputy when @entity69 was the head of @entity72 , @entity1 's national broadcasting company . @entity14 's term is up next year , but he is expected to seek another four years in office in the june election . @entity2 's @entity76 in @entity0 contributed to this report .	@entity22:Israeli	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Iranian	@entity0:Tehran	@entity26:England	@entity24:Ph.

the crowning of @placeholder on sunday led to angry , often bigoted tweets	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- in the seven years since its founding , @entity1 has become a go - to place for news updates , witty one - liners , political one - upmanship and even absurdist storytelling . it 's also become a go - to place for intolerant bile . on sunday night , @entity10 , an @entity11 of @entity13 ancestry , was named @entity14 . immediately , the @entity15 started spewing . " this is @entity14 ... not miss @entity18 , " said @ @entity16 . " congratulations @entity20 . our @entity14 is one of you , " posted @ @entity24 . what is it about @entity1 ? whether the events are earthshaking or trivial , the site of more than a half - billion accounts has something to say -- and often , it 's upset . @entity32 is named the new @entity33 ; the anger flows . @entity35 is acquitted ; people fly off the handle . comments on sports , tv shows , politics , news media -- when there 's something negative to be said , it will be said ( occasionally with poor spelling and in all @entity47 ) on @entity1 . as @entity48 summarized the @entity14 outcry on " @entity50 , " " and @entity1 , as usual , could not be happy . " @entity51 , a @entity52 - based psychiatrist who specializes in personality dynamics , observes that @entity1 's impulsiveness can get the best of people . " it 's very easy to jot something off and hit send , and you can impulsively say something without thinking it through , " he says , noting that it 's the reverse of the classic angry letter you write and then put in a drawer until you cool off . " with @entity1 , you do n't need to ( do that ) . and if there is feedback or push back , you do n't necessarily even see it . " as of friday afternoon , @entity1 had not responded to a request from @entity0 for comment . ' @entity71 is more influential ' such anger is n't just limited to @entity1 , of course . you can find it on other social media platforms , news site comment boards -- including on @entity0 -- and pretty much all over the @entity77 . @entity79 , for example , also has been known for attracting mean - spirited comments . still , @entity1 is an easy target . besides the impulsiveness @entity51 mentions , there 's a typical litany of virtual - world reasons for @entity1 's vitriol : anonymity , a perceived lack of consequences , a troll - ish desire to stir the pot. but perhaps the most intriguing was revealed in a study published recently by @entity95 researchers . by analyzing posts on @entity98 , a @entity99 version of @entity1 , they determined that anger is the most powerful online emotion . of the four basic emotions into which they classified tweets , sadness and disgust barely travel . @entity107 does better . but anger , like a potent virus , spreads the fastest and most widely of all . " our results show that anger is more influential than other emotions like joy , which indicates that the angry tweets can spread quickly and broadly in the network , " the researchers wrote . 23 key moments from @entity1 history the idea of @entity1 anger is so prominent that @entity122 , a geography professor at @entity123 in @entity124 , put together a map titled " @entity126 . " the project was inspired , in part , by racial slurs on @entity1 after president @entity131 's re-election . the map highlights sections of the country that engage in certain hate speech based on keywords , aggregated by county and adjusted for population . the results have favored rural areas , which @entity122 attributes to insularity and fear of outsiders . indeed , a more accurate title for the map would be " the geography of xenophobia , " she says . the map certainly hit home with certain parts of the country , @entity122 says . " so many people lashed out in anger towards me after seeing it , " she says . " i have hundreds of really angry e-mails that start with the term ' racist bitch . ' " anonymity and distance this is n't the sort of thing that tends to happen as widely on @entity163 or other social media sites . there are a couple reasons for that , says @entity168 , a professor at @entity170 's @entity169 . one is that @entity163 is largely a closed system in which you mainly communicate with people you know -- unlike @entity1 , where a tweet goes out to the whole world . moreover , @entity163 friends can react more directly to vitriolic posts , either by calling the poster out or simply unfriending him or her , she says . in may , the site strengthened policies to stamp out hate speech . " with @entity163 , there 's more accountability , " says @entity168 . " most people 's @entity163 accounts have multiple pictures of them , they 've got connections to ' these are my friends . ' there 's a lot less of the anonymity , so there 's a little less of the disinhibition that occurs . " @entity1 also creates more distance , adds @entity200 , a communications professor at @entity201 . " it 's asynchronous -- you 're not chatting real - time with another person -- so there 's less of a sense that the other people out there are real , " she says . a phone call or even some kinds of online dialogue establishes a connection that you 're dealing with actual human beings . but on @entity1 , that connection is n't there , so " that allows us to go off in ways that we would n't choose to do if we had to look at another person 's face when we did it . " consequences ? @entity1 's brief screeds seldom have consequences , though that may be changing . the site recently created a " report abuse " button and the media -- which is often to blame for highlighting anger -- is paying more attention to bullying on the site . but the idea of consequences is hard for @entity1 users to understand , observes @entity200 . " i think people do n't think about the long - term ramifications , " she says . " when i talk with students about how they use social media and say that a lot of employers will look to see what kinds of things you 're posting on @entity163 or @entity1 , i 'm surprised by the number of people who say , ' any employer that would stalk me that way online , i would n't want to work for them anyway . ' " there are signs that a growing number of @entity1 users do n't like the venom in their midst . after the nastiness with @entity14 , a number of people responded with positive tweets congratulating her . some even reprimanded the angry tweeters -- and received apologies . " i am so sorry . i did n't think before i tweeted what i did . i absolutely did not mean to hurt or offend anyone . again i am so very sorry ! ! ! " tweeted @ @entity262 . @entity200 points out that the system has much to overcome . " people use @entity1 to get reactions out of others , " she says . " it 's like a popularity contest : if you can put something out there that 's quick and inflammatory and it gets retweeted a ton , that 's your feedback -- that 's how you know that it was an interesting or effective tweet . and people do n't seem to be as concerned if the response is positive or negative . " and what works ? let 's all scream it at the top of our lungs : anger .

@placeholder has seen more advertising money spent on the internet rather than tv	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- if you grew up in the 70s , 80s and 90s , there 's a good chance that whole portions of your brain are still clogged up with the jingles , catchphrases and slogans that defined a golden era of television advertising . but in a new age of digital , on - demand and recorded viewing , when the fast - forward button is a weapon of choice , there are signs the 30 - second tv advertisement could be on its way out , perhaps sounding the death knell for a marketing tool that became part of the cultural landscape . it already appears to be happening in some countries . in 2009 , @entity29 became the first major economy to spend more on online marketing than on television , with the internet accounting for 23.5 % of all ad money , compared to tv 's 21.9 % . this is bad news for tv ad connoisseurs who , as the 30 - second slot evolved from basic product promotion into a sophisticated medium producing cinematic masterpieces and some of the sharpest humor ever broadcast , have come to revere them as works of art. anyone doubting the power of these should cast their mind back to the adverts of their youth . there are generations of @entity56 who consider the " @entity60 " a normal way to enter a swimming pool and for whom the words " plop plop , fizz fizz ... " will always mean @entity64 . likewise few @entity29 of a certain age can listen to @entity67 's @entity66 without thinking of deadpan cigar advertisements . nor can they forget the bizarre @entity70 robots that mocked earthlings for peeling potatoes rather than eat instant mash . and then there were the @entity77 ads. in a league of their own , these multi-million dollar wide screen epics barely made any reference to the beer they were marketing , instead relying on moodily - lit images of surfers facing tides of white horses , or convicts taming wild mustangs . in a post-economic crisis world , big spending on television ads now seems out of place . smaller budgets , coupled with new digital viewing habits , have led to numerous predictions about the imminent extinction of the 30 - second slot . but in a turnaround that few in the industry predicted , television advertising seems to be enjoying a renaissance , helped by rapid expansion in developing countries and by the platform that was once considered tv marketing 's sworn enemy -- the internet . " a lot of research is showing it is on the way back in , and if you look at some of the most successful campaigns of the past year or so , they 're all tv commercials , " said @entity110 , a former creative director at @entity119 who now runs the @entity122 agency . forecasts back this up . statistics produced by the @entity127 data mapping agency show that while worldwide internet advertising budgets will grow 12.5 % annually to $ 117.5 billion by 2016 , tv spending will also rise between 6 % and 9 % annually to $ 243.3 billion . " great tv commercials are still the epicenter of a lot of stuff , " said @entity130 , head of @entity132 - based ad agency @entity131 . " people started inventing tech to avoid advertising so advertising has to get better which is a good thing . it puts the onus back on advertising to do better by the consumer . not just bombard them into submission , but actually earn their attention . inform them , entertain them , and respect them . " some internet developments are actually helping drive viewers back to old watching habits . the popularity of " double screening " -- using @entity158 or other networking tools to chronicle what they see on tv -- is believed to be boosting the size of audiences watching in real time . advertisers can also harness the internet to give tv slots greater impact , allowing them to focus budget on production instead of paying for air time . a recent ad by @entity29 dairy firm @entity173 featuring rapping farmers ran once in a primetime slot but enjoyed 1.8 million @entity177 hits . while the @entity56 , @entity179 @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity181 are currently the world 's largest television advertising markets , much of the industry 's growth is now focused in developing countries where internet penetration is comparatively low . @entity188 , associate professor of media communications at @entity190 in @entity191 and author of " marketing in @entity194 , " says television still counts for up to 80 % of advertising budgets in nations like @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity178 , @entity200 and @entity201 . " it is still a growth area in these countries , but they are still lacking in terms of expertise and technical abilities , " he said . " @entity208 is big and with radio it is the dominant form , and i do n't think we 're going to see what we see in the @entity213 with the internet . " but , says @entity215 , chief executive of @entity216 -- the world 's largest advertising group -- this could change as cell phones offer cheap ways to access the internet , even in developing countries , and thus a perfect new platform for advertising . " it is true in the @entity213 , internet and mobile new media , social networking is more important from an advertising and marketing services point of view , but the speed of adaptation of the faster - growing markets is going to be greater because mobile has leapfrogged the pc as a cheap form of accessing the internet , " he said . such developments are n't worrying the ad men just yet . says @entity110 , even as technology advances , advertisers should n't forget that many people still choose to passively consume television in the old fashioned way . " people are still sitting there comatose in front of the tv and it 's a really good place to flog stuff to them .

" @entity9 was wearing a black bandoleer filled with 12 - gauge shotgun shells around his torso . attached to the bandoleer at chest level was a large black fixed - blade knife . on his ankle , @entity9 was weaving a revolver in an ankle holster . @entity9 's right hand was placed out - of - view behind his back , " the affidavit said . the officers commanded the man several times to " show us your hands . " at first he did n't comply . but then he " moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump - action shotgun with a pistol grip , " the affidavit said . after he raised the firearm , the officers scuffled with @entity9 . by the numbers : guns in @entity85 " officer @entity41 and i were able to take @entity9 to the ground . @entity9 continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands , " @entity8 said in the affidavit . " ultimately , officer @entity41 and i together were able to restrain @entity55 and disarm him . " more federal way police arrived . @entity8 said one of them asked @entity9 if there was anything in the apartment that " would hurt " law officers and he replied , " there are things inside that go boom . " the bomb squad was called to the scene and the residence and other apartments were evacuated . but police found no explosives . the shotgun @entity9 pointed was " loaded to capacity , including a round in the chamber . the safety was not engaged , " the affidavit said . the pistol on his ankle was loaded with " five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds , " it said , and about 50 12 - gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer . a search of the apartment produced an @entity125 - type rifle , a .45 caliber pistol , a @entity128 rifle , more ammunition and a laptop computer , @entity8 said . @entity9 's mother , identified as @entity132 in the affidavit , said @entity9 " spends a lot of time on the computer " but she " does not know what he does on it . " according to the affidavit , @entity132 said @entity9 has " negative views of president @entity7 and in the last few days , most recently that day , has made negative statements about the president . " after reading @entity9 his @entity145 rights , @entity8 asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene . " i think i do , but i do n't want to say it , " he said . he was shown a copy of the e-mail to the @entity23 and , asked if he wrote it , said , " possibly , " @entity8 wrote . asked if he had any " issues with the president , " @entity9 replied , " you do n't have a high enough security clearance . call the @entity156 or run it up the chain of command , " @entity8 said . threatening the president is punishable by up to five years in prison and assault of a federal agent is punishable by up to 20 years in prison , the @entity85 attorney 's office said .

@entity5 said she did n't deserve the @entity8 for " @placeholder	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- spiraling into oblivion really helps you see things from a different perspective . at sunday night 's premiere of " gravity , " @entity5 said she felt she did n't deserve the @entity8 when she won it for " @entity9 " three years ago — and now her performance as an astronaut stranded in orbit when space debris demolishes her shuttle could win her another one . the survival drama , out oct. 4 , got an intense reaction as the @entity19 's opening weekend drew to a close , with many marveling at both the technical and emotional achievements of director @entity24 ( " @entity26 , " " @entity25 " and the " @entity27 . " ) expect " gravity " to be a major player at the @entity8 this year in all the top categories . it should easily win in the visual effects category , and will be a heavy - duty competitor in the others . @entity5 is also a near certain @entity5 nominee , although she said her 2010 win still has n't sunk in . " i think most people have that out - of - body experience when they win the @entity8 . i had a little newborn at home , so my body was already out of itself , " @entity5 said in response to a question about awards season during the post-screening q&a with festival - goers . " i still have n't gotten around to having my moment with it yet . maybe one day it will come . " she 'll face formidable opponents in the race . @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 in " @entity54 , " and @entity55 from " @entity56 " are among the potential nominees generating voter buzz . @entity5 said awards talk is just part of the fun of festivals , and tried to put the coveted prize in a more grounded context . " what it does do is make you realize how hard you have to work to earn it , " she said . " i did n't feel worthy of it when i got it . so i thought , okay , i 'm going to spend the rest of my life hopefully earning it --- but having a really good time in the process , as well . " except the making " gravity " was ... anything but fun . since the film is set in orbit , she was often strung up on wires , or locked in a device that spun her wildly in different directions while multiple cameras shot close ups of her face . that footage was later woven into photo - real animation of her and @entity88 in jeopardy , floating far above the @entity90 . " it was painful , i remember . not for me -- but for you , " @entity24 said . @entity5 did n't hesitate to agree . " @entity96 , " she said , imitating his accent as she explained to the crowd : " that 's ' yes . ' " whenever she got frustrated , she would mock his @entity99 accent , @entity24 said . " it was frustrating , it was painful , and it was isolating . but how lucky am i that i got to have all those frustrations , you know , built in ? " @entity5 told the crowd . " that 's something people who are in the position these characters are in [ would be ] experiencing a thousand-fold . " that did n't mean she let @entity110 or @entity111 ( producer of the " @entity25 " films ) escape a little of the agony .

fastest serve record broken in @placeholder by @entity76 journeyman	@entity82	( @entity0 ) -- while @entity2 enjoys a fishing trip in his native @entity4 , @entity1 is closing on his @entity7 rival 's no. 2 ranking and his masters titles record after reaching the final in @entity11 . @entity2 , like @entity12 , could n't wait to get away from the controversial blue clay at the @entity14 but @entity1 has made the best of the situation and thrashed @entity17 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 on saturday in a one - sided semifinal . waiting in the final is @entity20 , who beat a tetchy @entity21 7 - 6 ( 5 ) , 7 - 6 ( 6 ) earlier in the day . @entity1 will move above @entity2 in the rankings if he wins his third @entity11 title , and will also equal the @entity25 's record of 20 masters titles . " i did n't even know actually about the no. 2 ranking , " @entity1 said . " i 'm focused on what i am doing here this week , trying to play well and get on a bit of a roll and i have played better and better as the tournament went on . " @entity17 had knocked out fellow @entity32 a day earlier , taking advantage of his compatriot 's dislike of the blue clay surface . but in a match watched by @entity11 star @entity38 , @entity17 was no match for @entity1 , who hit 25 winners to take his head - to - head record over the @entity42 to 5 - 0 . @entity1 's possible rise to no. 2 in the rankings is even more significant with the @entity46 looming . it means the 16 - time @entity49 champion could avoid playing @entity12 or @entity2 until the final . the victory also took @entity1 past the $ 70m mark in career prize money . @entity1 will play in his 33rd @entity55 final on sunday , while @entity20 competes in his third . the @entity58 sixth seed took advantage of several lapses by @entity21 , who was broken while serving for the first set and then disputed a series of line calls in the second set . " he was my toughest match of the week , " @entity20 said . @entity21 refused to shake hands with the umpire after the match but said later : " i lost because @entity20 played better , and that 's the only reason . " @entity20 trails @entity1 4 - 10 in head - to - heads byt has won three of their last five meetings . meanwhile , the @entity74 has confirmed that @entity76 journeyman player @entity75 served a 263kph ( 163 mph ) ace that broke the record for the fastest recorded serve . @entity75 , ranked no. 340 , delivered the serve at a challenger tournament in @entity82 to smash the previous record held by @entity84 at 251 kph ( 156 mph ) . @entity1 described @entity75 's effort as an " incredible number .

@entity6 elections wo n't delay scheduled withdrawals @entity5 says , ambassador @placeholder	@entity53	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- more than 3,000 @entity5 troops scheduled to deploy to @entity6 wo n't go after all , as the military tries to draw down troop levels in the war - torn country , a @entity3 spokesman said saturday . @entity5 troops speak to an @entity6 child in @entity12 on monday . the @entity14 , 10th @entity15 will not replace a @entity16 unit already in @entity6 , lt. col. @entity13 told @entity1 . the 3,500 - troop combat team , based in @entity18 , @entity19 , was to leave in january , he said . " [ the cancellation ] reflects a thorough assessment of the security environment in @entity6 and continued improvement in the ability of the @entity6 security forces to safeguard @entity6 citizens and institutions , " @entity13 said . the @entity29 unit is still on schedule to return home , which will speed up the drawdown of forces , he said . the troop withdrawal in @entity6 coincides with a debate in the @entity37 administration on whether to send as many as 40,000 more @entity5 troops to @entity39 . as of friday , 250 @entity5 soldiers have been killed in @entity39 since the start of the year , according to a @entity1 tally based on @entity3 numbers . the @entity5 plans to withdraw all its combat troops from @entity6 by august , leaving 50,000 in advisory roles . those advisers are to leave by the end of 2011 . concerns that a delay in the upcoming @entity6 elections could put a dent in scheduled withdrawals was rejected friday by @entity54 @entity53 . " as for our schedule of troop withdrawal , we 've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn , " he told @entity1 . " so our plan is to draw down the troops as we 've said we 're going [ to ] do . " the polls are scheduled to open january 16 , but both the @entity5 and the @entity63 are worried because @entity6 still has no election law . if a new law is n't adopted , the government may have to change the election date or rely on the law used in the 2005 elections , some officials say . a vote on the new law is expected monday . @entity3 officials also must weigh the impact of continuing violence in the country . @entity53 said the violence is a concern , as are insurgent efforts to undermine attempts at reconciliation in the divided country . " @entity81 is a tough business . i mean i 've been in some of these meetings with people , you know , they do n't like each other , you have to get them to work together , get them to understand their futures are together , and then you get a bombing , which makes it even tougher , " @entity53 said . " again , i think the @entity6 people have really signaled that they are really sick and tired of this stuff . " meanwhile , violence continued in @entity6 on saturday . four soldiers were killed and 10 people , including civilians and security forces , were wounded when a bomb targeting an @entity6 army checkpoint exploded in @entity103 , an @entity104 province town , an @entity96 official said . elsewhere in @entity104 , a suicide truck bomb hit a police checkpoint on a bridge west of @entity108 , wounding a police officer . the blast badly damaged the bridge , which carries a highway linking @entity6 with @entity113 and @entity114 , the official said . @entity115 had to be rerouted to an another road . @entity104 province , a massive region populated mostly by @entity119 , had been a major front in the @entity6 war . the @entity122 in @entity6 militant group once held great sway in @entity104 , but its influence lessened with the advent of @entity5 - backed groups called @entity128 . @entity1 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .	@entity29:National Guard	@entity81:Reconciliation	@entity115:Traffic	@entity114:Syria	@entity113:Jordan	@entity130:Mohammed Jamjoom	@entity119:Sunni Arabs	@entity3:Pentagon	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:WASHINGTON	@entity6:Iraq	@entity5:United States	@entity53:Hill	@entity54:U.S. Ambassador to Iraq	@entity16:North Carolina National Guard	@entity15:Mountain Division	@entity14:1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team	@entity13:Butterbaugh	@entity12:Baghdad	@entity37:Obama	@entity39:Afghanistan	@entity19:New York	@entity18:Fort Drum	@entity103:Falluja	@entity104:Anbar	@entity128:Awakening Councils	@entity129:Scott Spoerry	@entity108:Ramadi	@entity96:Iraqi Interior Ministry	@entity122:al Qaeda	@entity63:United Nations
group calls on @entity3 government to negotiate for @placeholder 's release	@entity1	the wife of @entity3 hostage @entity1 pleaded saturday with @entity4 to release him , describing her husband as a " peaceful , selfless man " who was only in @entity8 to help people in need . " i can not see how it could assist any state 's cause to allow the world to see a man like @entity19 , " @entity11 said , according to a message released by the @entity3 @entity13 . @entity4 refers to itself as " the @entity20 . " @entity1 , a taxi driver from near @entity21 , @entity22 , was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to @entity8 in december to deliver food and water to people affected by the @entity31 country 's devastating civil war . he was abducted the day after @entity32 by masked gunmen , according to other people in the aid convoy . in a videotaped execution of @entity3 aid worker @entity37 , made public last weekend , @entity4 displayed @entity1 and threatened to kill him next . no response to messages the @entity41 extremist group , which controls large areas of @entity43 and @entity8 , has already beheaded three @entity45 captives in recent weeks -- @entity37 , and the @entity48 journalists @entity46 and @entity49 . the videos of the executions have pointed to @entity48 airstrikes against @entity4 forces in @entity43 as the motivation . in @entity37 ' case , the militant group described the killing as " a message to the allies of @entity48 . " @entity1 's wife said her husband , a father of two , was only trying to do good in @entity8 . " @entity1 is a peaceful , selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the @entity3 to drive in a convoy all the way to @entity8 with his @entity69 colleagues and friends to help those most in need , " she said in the statement . she expressed concern that his captors were n't answering her calls for his release . " i have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to , " she said . ' executing this man is not the answer ' @entity4 has shown no regard in recent weeks for pleas from the families of its @entity45 hostages . days before @entity46 's killing was made public on august 19 , his family sent the extremists a message , asking them to show mercy . but they never heard back . the week before @entity49 's execution became known , his mother released a video pleading with @entity4 leader @entity93 not to kill him . and news of @entity37 ' death came the same day that his family released a brief message to his captors through the @entity3 @entity13 . @entity1 's wife urged the militants to respond . " i pray that the people holding @entity1 respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late , " she said . " when they hear this message , i implore the people of the @entity20 to see it in their hearts to release my husband , @entity1 . " leading @entity69 figures in the @entity3 have also called for @entity1 's release in a video posted on @entity110 in which they say that killing him is n't permitted by @entity113 law . " whatever your grievance with @entity48 or @entity3 foreign policy , executing this man is not the answer , " said @entity114 , a judge on the @entity115 in @entity116 . " we ask you to adhere to the @entity125 ruling on this matter and release him immediately and unconditionally . " the only non-muslim @entity1 was making his fourth trip to @entity8 with an aid convoy when he was abducted . while part of the convoy stopped at the @entity133 border , @entity1 -- the only non-muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into @entity8 with a 10 - person advance party . in video shot on that day , he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help . " it 's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go , " he said , before hugging a colleague . @entity1 was kidnapped the next day . dr. @entity147 , a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the @entity133 border , said they got a phone call saying @entity1 had been taken by masked gunmen . " this was something that we thought was just a temporary measure , with him being a non-muslim and being visibly @entity22 , " she told @entity158 . the other members of the convoy thought " that they would just question him further and then they would let him go , " she said . but amid clashes between @entity4 and rival rebel factions in the area , that did n't happen . ' he is not to blame ' now , @entity113 - @entity167 says she has a message for the people holding @entity1 . " as your sister in @entity113 , i would implore you and beg of you : please spare the life of this innocent man , " she said . " he is not part of your struggle . he is not to blame for the actions of @entity45 governments that you fight . " @entity180 , a @entity69 - led human rights advocacy group in @entity116 , also called for @entity1 's immediate release , saying he was n't involved in any hostilities toward @entity69 . but in a marked difference from other groups issuing appeals , cage called on the @entity3 government to negotiate with the hostage takers . @entity188 , research director of cage , told @entity158 on sunday that the releases of @entity133 and continental @entity193 hostages through negotiations " should act as a wake - up call to the @entity3 government . " he 's called ' gadget ' @entity167 said other members of the convoy gave @entity1 the affectionate nickname " gadget , " for his love of all things technical . " he really is the guy that fixes everything , " she told @entity158 . in @entity1 's hard - scrabble hometown of @entity207 in northern @entity22 , well - wishers have tied yellow ribbons to lampposts and street signs . none of his workmates at the taxi company nor any of the neighbors on his street were willing to talk to the news media . @entity167 says the situation is really difficult : " we know time is running out . " asked how people should think of @entity1 in his hour of need , she mentioned his smile , his concern for those around him and " his beautiful , beautiful golden heart .

26 - year - old @placeholder is the person @entity10 trusts most to speak for him online .	@entity0	@entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity0 is a lanky , 26 - year - old from @entity4 , @entity5 with a good job on @entity7 and a healthy adoration for @entity9 . and every day , he pretends to be @entity10 on the @entity11 . as @entity10 's in - house digital strategist , it is @entity0 's job to channel the freshman senator online , engage activists on @entity17 and @entity18 and promote @entity10 's media appearances and speeches . in just a few years , @entity10 has gone from working as the state @entity21 and as a corporate attorney to become one of the most talked - about politicians on the @entity26 . @entity10 began traveling to @entity27 and @entity28 in 2013 — and his many conservative fans are eager to see him run for president . @entity0 joined @entity10 in the early days of his @entity32 campaign in 2011 , when @entity10 was an unknown candidate with little hope to defeat the establishment - backed lt. gov. @entity34 . @entity0 's responsibilities on the campaign were two-fold : help manage @entity10 's online presence and drive him to events around the state . on the day of @entity10 's first debate , @entity0 was driving @entity10 in @entity42 when he ran a red light while fiddling with a gps . an oncoming vehicle slammed into the driver 's side of his @entity48 with a brutal crunch . no one was seriously injured , but it left $ 8,500 in damage to his car . @entity0 says he was " unceremoniously promoted " after the accident -- to behind a computer . " it was amazing how quickly we decided i should focus full - time on just the digital stuff rather than driving him around as well , " recalled @entity0 , who had driven @entity10 around the state for ten months . while @entity10 says he 's on @entity17 " constantly " through his @entity62 , the senator leaves much of the leg work to his old driver , @entity0 , who condenses the long - winded lawmaker into 140 - character bites . " out of any staff in the office , @entity10 trusts josh the most with his voice , " @entity10 spokeswoman @entity67 told @entity2 . " @entity0 understands his voice and understands what he would want to promote . " according to data from @entity18 and @entity17 provided to @entity74 in december , @entity10 is mentioned more on social media than any other politician . between sept. 1 and dec. 1 , @entity10 's accounts were mentioned on @entity17 , 4.5 million times , which is 1.7 million more than former secretary of state @entity79 and 2.6 million more than the closest @entity80 , @entity81 . @entity10 's most popular tweets , unsurprisingly , tend to be when he sounds the most uncompromising . his most retweeted post in 2014 included a call to impeach attorney general @entity85 ; on @entity18 , a joke about president @entity87 being the worst president in history received nearly 80,000 " likes " and more than 18 million impressions on the site , according to data provided by @entity10 office to @entity2 . that cohesion between @entity10 and @entity0 dates back to the countless hours the duo spent alone together crisscrossing @entity5 during the campaign . @entity0 accompanied @entity10 to scores of events and quickly memorized every line of @entity10 's old speeches . @entity0 , who prefers to stay behind the scenes as much as possible — he declined to be interviewed on camera -- says part of the secret to @entity10 's success online is his willingness to engage on issues that supporters are eager to discuss . " half the time if you try to force issues and force messaging that 's not what your activists want to talk about , you 're doing damage to yourself , " @entity0 said . " if you had somebody who did n't speak as well [ as @entity10 ] or have the same type of personality , i could see it being a lot more difficult . i think that 's definitely a big part of it . but you 've also got to know who your audience is and speak to them . " that approach , however , has left @entity10 with a list of enemies in @entity1 , where some in his own party sees him as a rabble - rouser and an ideologue who refuses to compromise . " if you 're from @entity5 , that 's the right thing to do . that 's what they expect you to do , " @entity0 said . it 's easy to see why @entity10 and @entity0 get along so well . in college , @entity0 was a member of the " @entity140 , " a group traditionally known to be more conservative than the @entity142 at the @entity143 in @entity144 . as a point of personality , @entity0 also knows a thing or two about being a troublemaker : late last year , he logged onto @entity150 's @entity17 account when she was away from her desk and posted a string of silly tweets full of emojis and a solicitation of advice for where she could get a good dye job in @entity1 . " do n't ever leave your computer unlocked around him , " she tweeted after the prank . @entity0 got his start with the @entity165 before joining @entity144 - based @entity166 , a digital strategy firm founded by @entity80 strategist @entity168 , who directed @entity10 's digital operations until late last year . last november , @entity168 , a digital whiz who deserves a great deal of credit for @entity10 's success online , made a surprise move to work for @entity176 sen. @entity81 , a potential future rival if both men run for the @entity80 presidential nomination . @entity0 said he did n't see it coming . " we had just been meeting about some of the stuff that we would 've liked to get done and then it just came out of nowhere , " he said . " it 's been a little interesting since he left to go do @entity81 's stuff , but we still talk . we get along fine . no bad blood there . " in an email to @entity2 , @entity168 praised @entity0 's work , but predicted that @entity10 would face serious competition in the online space if he competes in 2016 . " @entity0 has always worked incredibly hard and he has done a great job of remembering the importance of engagement when it comes to social , " @entity168 said . " it has been a space that senator @entity10 has excelled in since 2011 but i 'm certain that it 's going to get harder for them as other big names with big brands join the fray . " while @entity168 ' departure came as blow to @entity10 's operation , it put @entity0 in a position to play a stronger role in the senator 's day - to - day online operation . @entity10 's online break - out moment came in september 2013 , when the senator began a 21 - hour filibuster in protest of the presidents health care law on the @entity32 floor . not knowing that his boss would remain on the floor for such a long time , @entity0 manned the @entity17 feed through the night . watching from a tv in his office that broadcast the @entity32 floor proceedings , @entity0 spent the night tweeting @entity10 's best lines . @entity10 had mentioned his admiration for how @entity81 had spent part of his filibuster earlier that year to read tweets from supporters . so before the speech , @entity0 put out a call on @entity10 's @entity17 account asking people to tweet at his account about @entity234 . @entity0 printed out the best submissions and ran them to the @entity32 cloak room near the door of the @entity32 , where another staffer picked them up and put it in front of @entity10 . " @entity234 , " @entity10 said , reading from the tweet on the paper . " ai n't nobody got time for that . " @entity0 immediately clipped a video of @entity10 reciting that quote — a reference to a popular internet video about a woman who described escaping a fire -- from the @entity32 floor feed , uploaded it to @entity254 and tweeted the quote from @entity10 's official account . today , it has nearly 900 retweets . @entity0 remembers the moment fondly as his contribution to @entity262 political history . " no matter what else happens , ' ai n't nobody got time for that ' is in the congressional record because of lowly ol ' me , " he said . it would n't be the last time @entity0 would thrust @entity10 into the pop culture conversation . @entity0 is an obsessive @entity9 fan — and yes , this began before she branched out from the country music scene , he 'll have you know — and he uses every opportunity he can to incorporate her into his work . in november , @entity10 tweeted an auto - tuned video of @entity278 , the @entity279 professor who helped construct @entity234 , using the beat from @entity9 's " @entity281 . " during @entity10 's @entity32 campaign , @entity0 made a point to see four @entity9 concerts in @entity5 in less than two months . colleagues say he even logs into @entity9 fan message boards , and his personal @entity17 page is full of @entity9 music videos , gifs and photos . " i admit i probably like @entity9 more than i should , " he said . his adoration seems to be spreading throughout the @entity10 office , where a 2015 @entity9 calendar — courtesy of his colleague , @entity150 -- hangs on the wall . in december , the @entity10 staff @entity17 account posted a @entity300 clip from the " @entity301 " music video of @entity9 , dancing in a leotard while singing , " ca n't stop cruising ... " when he 's not thinking of @entity10 or @entity9 , @entity0 's head is in space . @entity0 , a self - declared @entity307 geek , originally planned to study aerospace engineering in college , but he switched to political science . the shelf near his desk is decorated in toy spaceships that he 's collected over the years , and his personal @entity17 page , beneath the bio , " i like space life is better in @entity317 pardon my @entity5 " is full of pictures of space shuttles ( interspersed between @entity320 and emojis . ) in early december he even traveled to @entity323 , @entity324 to watch the @entity326 space shuttle launch , which , of course , he live - tweeted . @entity0 's space knowledge may come in handy next year , because @entity10 is next in line to be the chairman of the @entity332 and @entity333 subcommittee . that , however , may not be the most exciting part about @entity10 's year in 2015 . @entity10 is considered a possible presidential contender , and if he runs , @entity0 said he believes @entity10 's digital groundwork that has served him so well in @entity5 would be ready to go national . " should it go that way , " he said , " we 'd be in a good place to do it . " and for that campaign — if it happens -- @entity0 wo n't be anywhere near a steering wheel .	@entity140:Young Conservatives of Texas	@entity21:Solicitor General	@entity26:Web	@entity27:Iowa	@entity28:New Hampshire	@entity279:MIT	@entity80:Republican	@entity81:Paul	@entity254:YouTube	@entity85:Eric Holder	@entity278:Jonathan Gruber	@entity87:Obama	@entity333:Science	@entity332:Senate Space	@entity150:Frazier	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Washington	@entity0:Josh Perry	@entity7:Capitol Hill	@entity5:Texas	@entity4:Nederland	@entity9:Taylor Swift	@entity234:Obamacare	@entity79:Hillary Clinton	@entity165:Texas Republican Party	@entity74:Politico	@entity317:GIFs	@entity17:Twitter	@entity144:Austin	@entity32:Senate	@entity34:David Dewhurst	@entity11:Internet	@entity10:Cruz	@entity300:Vine	@entity18:Facebook	@entity166:Harris Media	@entity262:American	@entity324:Fla.	@entity326:Orion	@entity301:Shake It Off	@entity320:Taylor Swift GIFs	@entity307:NASA	@entity142:College Republicans	@entity143:University of Texas	@entity62:iPhone	@entity168:Harris	@entity176:Kentucky	@entity323:Cape Canaveral	@entity281:Shake it Off	@entity42:Houston	@entity67:Catherine Frazier	@entity48:Dodge Caliber

the @placeholder encourages all sides to resolve their disputes diplomatically	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 and @entity2 put on sharp display thursday their continuing differences over territorial disputes in the @entity7 and @entity8 , disputes that are now boiling over into violence . in a joint news conference at the @entity15 , @entity12 chairman gen. @entity11 and his @entity2 counterpart , gen. @entity13 , described their private discussions as " refreshingly frank " and " constructive " before expressing opposing views of who is to blame for the broadening tensions . @entity2 and @entity21 are currently locked in a standoff after @entity2 installed an oil rig on an island in the @entity26 chain ( jointly claimed by the two countries ) , sparking protests in @entity21 , including violent attacks on @entity2 and ethnic @entity2 residents . @entity13 said , " we do not make trouble but we are not afraid of trouble , " adding " in matters of territory , our attitude is firm . we wo n't give an inch . " @entity11 countered , " we have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes , " including " what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it .

" @entity23 , " which is the work of @entity13 lawmaker @entity34 , features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the @entity29 to paint @entity30 as a threat to western society . it has been posted on several web sites , including @entity36 and @entity5 . last week , about 50 @entity1 students broke into a @entity13 consulate compound to protest the movie . they tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of @entity43 and ripped down a flag , said a @entity13 @entity46 spokeswoman . @entity13 prime minister @entity47 has said his government is worried that @entity34 ' film could provoke a violent backlash . the film has also prompted protests in other parts of the @entity3 world . soon after its release last month , hundreds of angry @entity3 rallied in @entity57 , where the government temporarily blocked access to @entity5 because of a trailer for @entity34 ' film . the protesters burned the @entity13 flag and called on @entity57 to cut ties with the @entity13 . the @entity13 government and others , including the @entity67 and the @entity68 , have rejected the film . the @entity68 has 57 member states across four continents and claims on its web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization , after the @entity74 . in its statement , it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the @entity13 government to prosecute the author of the documentary under @entity13 law . but @entity34 has stood by his project . " my intention was not to offend in any way , but to show the truth -- at least the truth as i see it , " @entity34 told @entity2 .

the @entity242 took place in @entity10 , @placeholder	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- most horses at this month 's @entity2 could clear the water jumps . not @entity4 . plunging head - first into a water feature he had n't even seen , @entity4 lost an entire hoof in the accident . luckily , the eight - foot mascot -- @entity4 was named after @entity10 , the @entity11 host province of the @entity2 -- had a spare hoof on hand . @entity4 's soaring popularity may have outstripped his jumping capabilities , with replica plush - toy versions almost impossible to find by the end of the two - week games in @entity19 , but there were plenty of contenders ready to demonstrate how water should be handled . driving is the sport to pick if you want to see horses navigate water . the sport , not seen at the @entity30 , sees teams of four horses pull an old - fashioned carriage through a series of tests to determine a winner . the most visually appealing of those tests is the marathon , in which the driver and horses must face a time trial across a course involving miniature mazes , lakes , hills and other hazards . the driver is by no means alone : in the marathon , two teammates ride on the back of their carriage , shifting their weight as though riding a superbike rather than a souped - up stagecoach . nobody drives a carriage quite like @entity56 . the @entity57 has now won three world titles in a row , mastering not only the marathon but also the driven dressage ( fancy moves determine how harmonious your horses look ) and the obstacle test ( steer your team through sets of cones , losing marks for any you hit ) . you can not fault the @entity2 for the variety on offer . take a stroll for 10 minutes from the carriage driving and you come to the @entity2 village , an array of shops and stalls with an equestrian theme . ambitious spectators could be found heaving saddles around the village having been inspired to impulse buy , while local horses bustled between the shoppers , offering rides or even helping to transport equipment . these are the literal workhorses of the @entity2 -- toiling in the comparative shadows while illustrious cousins , some worth tens of millions of dollars , strutted to the beat in packed adjacent venues . music is surprisingly integral to much of horse sport . dressage , the discipline which tests how well a horse and rider work together through a series of intricate moves , has long culminated in a freestyle routine where rousing music , pitched perfectly and matched meticulously in every movement , can win you a world title . but vaulting , too , makes the most of a melody . vaulting is gymnastics on the back of a horse , a sport where athletes clad head - to - toe in spandex perform handstands , leaps , cartwheels and more on top of a horse cantering in a 20 - metre circle . " music choice is really difficult , " said @entity122 's @entity121 , who defended her vaulting world title in @entity11 this past week . " i had quite a struggle trying to find something i could work to , that looked good when i did it . " @entity121 ended up settling for a selection from famed @entity11 stage show @entity130 , with musical numbers a common theme among competitors . " with it being from a @entity11 musical , for me it brings together the fact that i 'm here in @entity11 , and i can be a bit emotional and bring together all of my vaulting , " said @entity121 . the atmosphere after she finished ? anything but miserable , as organizers married the finesse and delicacy of equine gymnastics with a bombastic sound system and frenzied announcers . hundreds of schoolchildren screamed in unison to welcome each vaulter . @entity11 's @entity153 could barely contain her pride as dozens of @entity11 flags waved jubilantly back at her , following her final routine . @entity157 knows that feeling , too . the @entity11 showjumper shouldered the hopes of the host nation on the final day of the @entity2 . showjumping takes on a rare format at the @entity2 -- the @entity164 , a contest in which the leading four athletes must master their rivals ' rides to win the gold . first , you ride your own horse around a shortened set of jumps , aiming to do so within a specified time limit . then , unusually , you must complete the same course on each of the other three finalists ' horses . perhaps one of the most embarrassing fates in equestrian sport -- aside from being @entity4 the mascot , stepping soggily from a water jump -- is to mess up the showjumping on your own horse , only to see someone else do a better job of riding the same animal . step forward @entity190 's @entity189 , who clattered into a fence on his own ride ( casall ask ) then had to watch @entity195 @entity194 horse whisper his way to a clear round on the same horse . the last gold medal of the @entity2 came down to a straight fight between @entity194 and @entity157 , who had overcome the sudden death of his brother @entity203 , earlier in the year , to reach the highest level of showjumping in the world . the stage had been set for an emotional victory for the @entity11 , in front of a deafening crowd inside @entity19 's soccer stadium . yet one time fault -- the narrowest possible margin -- denied @entity157 the win . his fractionally tardy round aboard casall ask ( again the culprit ) saw @entity194 , who went clear on all four horses , add individual gold to his earlier team title . a dominant week for the @entity195 ahead of the @entity30 . if we began with @entity4 , the final word goes to another surprising candidate on four legs : a dog named @entity226 , who set a record at an event for a different species . @entity231 , a paradressage rider from the @entity232 , brought @entity226 on the journey as her service dog . journey required a special pass to head inside venues with @entity231 , hence becoming the first accredited canine in @entity2 history . happily , @entity226 avoided the water jump .	@entity153:Anne-Sophie Musset	@entity157:Delaveau	@entity130:Les Miserables	@entity232:United States	@entity2:Games	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:Norman	@entity195:Dutch	@entity194:Jeroen Dubbeldam	@entity190:Sweden	@entity57:Australian	@entity56:Boyd Exell	@entity30:Rio 2016 Olympics	@entity11:France	@entity10:Normandy	@entity19:Caen	@entity231:Collier	@entity242:FEI Games	@entity203:Stephane	@entity122:Britain	@entity121:Eccles	@entity189:Rolf-Goran Bengtsson	@entity164:Final Four	@entity226:Journey

" they came from another mountain a few miles away and destroyed our front gate , " says a pro-christian fighter who supports @entity5 president @entity34 and was involved in the battle for the mountaintop . the @entity11 is not a civilian target these days . dozens of @entity44 fighters , mostly @entity14 , as well as regular @entity5 army forces , are stationed there . the force has a tank , artillery pieces , mortars and light weapons at its disposal . many of the @entity14 in @entity6 say they are under threat from radical islamists among rebel fighters battling the @entity34 regime . " times are awful , " one man told @entity59 on a visit to the monastery . " we always have to watch our backs and be ready for an attack . we always carry a gun and a grenade because we could be attacked at any moment . " @entity14 are a minority in @entity5 . they make up about 10 % of the population . but @entity4 has a rich history here . @entity1 was baptized in @entity5 , some of the earliest relics were found here , and the town of @entity75 , also in the @entity12 , is one of the last places where the ancient @entity78 that @entity1 spoke is still the main language . but @entity80 was recently invaded by @entity82 - linked militants of the @entity84 rebels . nuns were kidnapped and have yet to be released . all this is stoking fears among @entity5 's @entity14 that their existence in @entity5 might be under threat . " i do n't just think so . i am sure they are targeting us because we are @entity14 ... and we have had many attacks , " one fighter at the @entity11 told @entity59 . many of @entity5 's @entity14 support the @entity34 regime , fearing that the end of the current government could lead to instability and an @entity101 power grab . in @entity6 , @entity4 fighters work closely with the @entity5 military , and the opposition accuses them of shelling rebel - held towns in the @entity12 from the @entity11 . @entity4 leaders in @entity5 say they are not taking sides in the conflict , but just protecting themselves , their towns and neighborhoods while the opposition has done little to assure them that @entity4 would have a place in @entity5 if the @entity34 regime were to fall .	@entity44:pro-Assad	@entity1:Jesus	@entity14:Christians	@entity6:Saidnaya	@entity11:Cherubim Monastery	@entity5:Syria	@entity8:Damascus	@entity80:Ma'aloula	@entity101:Islamist	@entity82:al Qaeda	@entity4:Christian	@entity84:Jabat al Nusra	@entity78:Aramaic	@entity12:Qalamoun Mountains	@entity75:Ma'aloula	@entity59:CNN	@entity34:Assad
@entity2 who has died in @placeholder aged 88 , came from a privileged and political family	@entity0	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 , who has died in @entity0 aged 88 , was an inspiration to all of us who wanted to make the world a more peaceful and more equal place . he came from a privileged and political family , his father and grandfather both @entity11 , and he would have become lord @entity12 in the early 1960s if he had not fought to renounce his hereditary peerage . luckily he won , stayed an mp instead of mouldering in @entity16 's upper @entity15 for the next five decades , and dedicated his life to socialist ideas and most importantly to campaigning for change . @entity2 was born in the aftermath of @entity21 he was an airman in @entity22 , and often talked about his experience . he lost a brother in that war , but also saw it as a watershed , marking no return to the unemployment and fascism of the 1930s . as he said , the young conscripted troops became radicalized by the war , arguing that if there could be full employment in wartime , so there could be full employment in peacetime to build houses , hospitals , schools and all the other things people needed . he was @entity46 all his life , campaigning for the 1945 landslide , but in the last part of his life his main activity was outside @entity46 's structures . i remember vividly how he used this wartime experience on one occasion . just after @entity55 became prime minister , we wanted to hold an anti-war demo going from @entity58 to parliament , but the march was banned by the police . i received a phone call from @entity2 to say that he had just dropped a letter off in @entity64 complaining about this decision and promising to defy it . sure enough he turned up on the day wearing his @entity22 medals and demanding to march . we set off , daring the police to arrest us . they did n't . he quipped that he was leaving parliament in order to spend more time with politics . this was after the death of his beloved wife @entity77 , herself a socialist campaigner and writer . he spent the rest of his life campaigning for a range of causes , but above all he was identified with the @entity88 , of which i became the convenor when we launched it in 2001 . he campaigned and spoke at every demo , travelled round the country to hold rapturous and well - attended meetings , and became president of the campaign , a post he held up to his death . he was opposed to the wars the @entity16 government and its @entity102 allies were waging , including the latest attempt to start another war on @entity105 last summer . he also helped campaign against austerity , most recently through the @entity108 . @entity2 was polite , disciplined , hard working , political : all the things you could wish for in a campaigner . he was a delight to talk to , interested always in ideas , technological change , history , and building broad united campaigns . one of the last conversation i had with him he stressed the importance of organizing , and wanted may 1 , the international day of working class struggle , to be marked into 2014 as a day to rise up against austerity . that is an invitation i hope millions of people will take up . maybe we could call it @entity2 day . that would be a fitting legacy . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .	@entity22:World War II	@entity2:Benn	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity12:Stansgate	@entity11:MPs	@entity16:UK	@entity15:House of Lords	@entity88:Stop the War Coalition	@entity102:U.S.	@entity21:World War I.	@entity105:Syria	@entity55:Gordon Brown	@entity108:People 's Assembly	@entity46:Labour	@entity64:Downing St	@entity58:Trafalgar Square	@entity77:Caroline	@entity133:Lindsey German
@entity7 is considered fiercely loyal to the military , a prodigy of former dictator @placeholder	@entity3	@entity1 's military leaders have nominated a former general considered fiercely loyal to former dictator senior general @entity3 to be the country 's next vice president . @entity7 's expected promotion from chief minister of @entity9 to the second highest post in the country has disappointed observers who hoped for a more reform - friendly candidate . " the military chose someone who they can count on , " said @entity14 , editor of @entity17 - based @entity16 magazine which covers @entity1 news . describing @entity7 as a prodigy of the former dictator , @entity14 said that his selection was not surprising given that the post had to be filled by the military . " i think they chose someone who would protect the vested interests of the military and the former dictator . so the choice does n't seem surprising but it does n't make anything promising to this reform process , " he said . " he 's not noted as a reformer , " said @entity33 , an associate professor at @entity34 in @entity35 , of the 61 - year - old candidate . " i think that fact alone will disappoint many people who watch and are closely involved in @entity1 . " since becoming president in march 2011 , @entity40 has steered @entity1 , which is also known as @entity1 , away from its repressive military past , towards what many hope is a truly democratic future . the release of lauded democracy campaigner @entity47 from house arrest and her subsequent election to parliament is the clearest signal yet of @entity40 's commitment to reform . @entity47 attends first session of parliament since taking oath however , military men still dominate parliament and any step forward must be navigated with their approval , which has made @entity1 's democratic reform a delicate and difficult process . the resignation of the " hardliner " vice president @entity62 early this month handed the military a clear opportunity to convey its view on the direction the country is taking . will vice president 's exit boost @entity1 reform efforts ? " i think by appointing someone who is not an overt reformer they 're sort of signaling i think what we understand to be their current situation ; that they 're much more cautious , much more reluctant reformers than some of the reformist groups in the government , " @entity33 said . according to @entity16 , @entity7 graduated from the @entity84 in 1971 before rising through the ranks to become commander of the @entity87 11 , responsible for security in @entity9 , also known as @entity89 . he later served in the @entity90 before returning to @entity9 as head of the @entity92 where he was thought to have participated in the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2007 " @entity95 . " as least a dozen people were killed , several dozens wounded and more than 2,000 arrested , according to a @entity99 report , which added that the toll could be much higher . " ( @entity7 ) was responsible for security affairs in @entity89 , @entity9 and when the shooting took place the order probably came from the top and he had to take care of all the things on the ground , meaning the troops and killing and detaining , " @entity14 said . however , @entity33 said @entity7 was also considered someone who " gets along , " that is , someone who can navigate a path between military loyalists and people within the government more receptive to change . " in that context he 's not altogether that different from the current president @entity40 who of course is also someone who seems to be able to get along with both the previous regime and some of the reformers , " he said . @entity33 described former vice president @entity62 as a " very rough character with rough edges who aggravated a lot of people , particularly in the reformist camp . " " i think ( @entity127 ) wo n't be as overtly oppositional to reform . i think the remaining question is to what extent will he support it ?

" but for more than 50 years , he 's appeared on the screen and behind the camera . his film credits include " @entity21 , " " @entity23 " and the three " @entity24 " westerns . he owns four @entity25 -- two for direction of " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " and best picture wins for those two films -- and he 's been nominated for six others . his most recent contribution to the film world is " @entity5 . " in the film , which @entity3 also directed , he stars as @entity35 , a @entity36 veteran who is forced by immigrant neighbors to challenge his prejudices . @entity35 is a recognizable type , the gruff , sometimes bigoted old man who may be hiding more heart than he lets on . even though he 's not too caring at the start , " he ends up expressing love to a family he 's never known before , " @entity3 said . @entity2 talked with @entity3 , 78 , about the movie , his future as an actor and what he expects in terms of awards . the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity2 : when you read the script , were you at all concerned about the nature of the language ? @entity3 : no , i was n't . if you 're going to learn something and progress in the movie as a character , you have to start as something else in order to learn tolerance . and your character obviously is never too old to learn that , so he has to be a certain way . but i -- being politically incorrect -- i find [ it ] fascinating because i hate the so - called @entity72 thing . i think that 's one of the things that 's damaging our generation at the present time . everybody is taking themselves and everything so seriously . if they just relax a little more and take themselves and everything else a little less seriously , they 'd have a lot more fun . @entity2 : i understand @entity87 [ @entity88 ] was the original screenplay writer . boy , did he get a grand slam , getting @entity3 to sign onto his project . @entity3 : well , it was interesting because he had a hard time getting it to us for some reason . anyway , they did and finally they got it to @entity100 , who 's my associate . and he read it and said , " well , it 's kind of interesting . you might find this character interesting . " he says , " he 's got a lot of -- he 's kind of a racist -- he 's a little bit of a lot of things . " i said , " well , it sounds interesting , i 'll read it . " you know , he said the same thing you 're saying . he said , " it 's not exactly politically correct . " i said , " perfect . let me read it . i 'll read it tonight . " @entity2 : it 's great that after doing so many films in your long career , you 're still looking for that edgy material . the material that 's not quite in the box obviously . and i heard that you do n't know if you 'll be doing too much acting anymore ? @entity3 : i do n't think so . i just do n't think there 's going to be that many good roles , or as you say , edgy material . @entity2 : maybe not edgy material for the typical senior that 's an actor , but you 're a legend . you 're @entity3 . so i 'm thinking people are writing stuff for you . @entity3 : i 'll tell you why . it 's that i do enjoy being behind the camera . i started directing 38 years ago in order to be involved in the whole project and not just the one component of acting . and so it became interesting to me to look at the whole picture . and so i 'm enjoying it back there . and next picture i do , @entity149 [ @entity150 ] 's going to be upfront and i 'm going to be behind the camera . and that 's where , i think , where i belong . @entity2 : and you guys are shooting that film [ about @entity159 ] in @entity160 ? @entity3 : yeah . @entity2 : you guys are buddies now . @entity3 : well , this will be our third together film over the years . the other two films [ " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " ] seem to be reasonably successful , so we just hope we can keep a trend . @entity2 : you 've got " @entity167 , " and then you 've got " @entity5 .

@placeholder hostility toward group goes back a long way	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- community organization @entity1 is fighting back after allegations that it is trying to register voters fraudulently and to swing the presidential election for @entity6 @entity5 . @entity1 executive director @entity7 announces the group 's lawsuits and television spot wednesday . the group this week released a 30 - second tv ad calling on @entity14 candidate @entity13 to stop " attempts at voter suppression across the country . " it also said it was filing several lawsuits around the country to halt the alleged suppression . @entity14 have " challenged election officials , and they 've filed lawsuits in an effort to thwart these new voters -- our citizens -- from casting their votes on tuesday . this effort must be stopped , " @entity1 board member @entity28 said during a news conference wednesday . watch @entity1 , conservatives spar » @entity1 contends it tried to help authorities head off election fraud . " in nearly every case that has been reported , it was @entity1 that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities , putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious , encouraging election officials to investigate , and offering to help with prosecutions , " @entity1 said in an october 9 news release . on friday , a @entity46 judge rejected state @entity14 demands to obtain lists of voters registered by @entity1 . the judge , @entity51 , said the @entity46 @entity14 failed to convince him of the need for a preliminary injunction that would have required immediate action in the final days before the election . the state @entity14 accuses @entity1 of widespread fraud in helping register some 140,000 voters in @entity46 . " this kind of manufactured crisis is masking [ @entity14 ] efforts to keep voters from voting , " @entity1 spokeswoman @entity59 told @entity0 . the top lawyer representing the @entity46 @entity14 said they were " disappointed . " but , @entity69 added , the wording of the court order indicates the judge thinks @entity1 has problems . @entity72 said he would favor " expedited discovery " should someone want to pursue " evidence that in @entity46 practices of @entity77 can encourage duplicate voter registration . " in @entity82 , @entity83 , nearly half of the 5,000 registrations @entity1 submitted in early october were not good . @entity83 's @entity84 secretary of state @entity84 has requested a criminal investigation , and federal law enforcement officials are considering whether to open a federal investigation based on state reports . during the october 15 presidential debate , @entity13 said @entity1 " may be destroying the fabric of @entity92 democracy . " officials for @entity1 -- which stands for @entity94 -- calls such statements hysteria , but acknowledge that some of their hires have turned in improper voter registrations . on its web site , the group contends that those employees were lazy and did n't want to work for their pay , making @entity1 , not the public , the victim . those workers have been fired and some even prosecuted , and the false registrations have not led to voter fraud , the group contends . " even the general counsel of the @entity110 [ @entity110 ] has acknowledged that he can not cite a single example of an improper vote having been cast as a result of alleged voter registration fraud , " @entity1 executive director @entity7 said . former @entity116 secretary of state @entity115 , who headed up president @entity118 's 2004 campaign in @entity116 , has said that @entity5 once was an organizer and trainer for @entity1 . @entity5 's campaign says that 's not true . as an attorney , @entity5 represented @entity1 alongside the @entity125 in suing the state of @entity127 to force state compliance with a federal voting access law , the campaign 's web site says . and @entity1 was not involved in @entity130 , a voter registration drive that @entity5 ran in @entity127 in 1992 , according to the web site . @entity1 , founded in 1970 , calls itself " the nation 's largest grassroots community organization of low - and moderate - income people .

he was traveling from @placeholder to @entity15 when he was questioned , he says	@entity16	( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 politician critical of @entity4 drone strikes said saturday that @entity4 authorities detained and questioned him at a @entity7 airport . @entity8 , a former cricket star , this month led a march to the border of @entity2 's tribal region to protest drone strikes , which he says end up killing more civilians than militants . @entity8 said he boarded a @entity15 - bound plane in @entity16 on friday when two @entity4 immigration officials asked him to step outside . the officials made him wait for about 40 minutes before interviewing him for another 20 minutes , he said . " i kept asking them what was this all about , and then one guy interviewed me and he was so confused , he had no idea what he was saying , " @entity8 told @entity0 by phone from @entity20 , another stop on his trip . " he was talking about some fund - raising , so i asked him to come to the point , and he said , ' we 're worried you might use violence against drones . ' i mean , it was so ridiculous , i did n't even know how to answer it . " @entity8 : " we 'll sweep the election " @entity8 missed his flight , but he eventually made it to @entity15 , and later @entity20 , for fund - raisers for his political party , @entity42 . he has two more fund - raisers on the schedule , in @entity45 and @entity46 , before he returns home to @entity2 , @entity8 said . the cricket legend said he suspects @entity4 officials simply wanted to make him miss an anti-drone protest @entity8 was scheduled to lead in the @entity4 , without realizing the protest had already been postponed because of the @entity53 holiday of @entity54 . a @entity56 official acknowledged that @entity8 was " briefly delayed " before boarding the next flight to the @entity4 . " the issue was resolved , " the official said . " mr. @entity8 is welcome in the @entity4 . " @entity8 has been a fierce critic of @entity4 policy in @entity2 and the use of drone strikes , calling them a violation of @entity2 's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger toward @entity67 . in recent years , the @entity4 government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in @entity2 's mostly ungoverned tribal region , widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in @entity75 . @entity4 officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare . anti-drone peace march halted in @entity2 @entity8 says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians . that , he said , is counterproductive to the war on terrorism . " if you alienate them , you lose the war , because they 're the ones who are going to eventually provide logistical support , " he said . " from these people will be the recruits to the militants .

@entity157 : @placeholder killings show anti-government extremists remain a threat	@entity2	the horrendous ambush assassination of two @entity2 police officers at a pizzeria and the killing of a good @entity5 by a violent young married couple with anti-government hatred again show that domestic extremists on the fringes remain a continuing threat in @entity11 . in fact , in recent weeks the @entity12 reconstituted a law enforcement working group devoted to addressing right - wing extremism . one of sunday 's killers , who was reportedly removed by other militia protesters from the @entity19 ranch standoff earlier this spring , draped an officer 's body with a yellow @entity22 , " a swastika and a note about " revolution . " in the 1970s , a significant violent threat came from small , tight - knit groups of the " revolutionary left " such as the @entity29 and @entity30 as well as the anti-police @entity31 whose assassination sprees left 13 officers dead across the nation . since the early 1980s , however , the domestic extremism threat pendulum has swung right , not only to white supremacists , but to anti-government " @entity42 " adherents who sometimes , but not always , embrace hard - core racial prejudice and violence . today , according to the @entity44 , these groups number more than 1,000 . the left - wing extremist groups of the 1970s operated as small , yet highly structured , segregated offshoots of the nonviolent civil rights and anti-war community . unlike the more consistently planned bombings and premeditated assassinations of the 1970s left , right - wing violence today runs the gamut from sunday 's ambush to more spontaneous killings that follow car stops or police calls about relatively mundane disputes . in 2010 , two @entity58 , @entity59 , police officers were killed by anti-government extremists during a routine car stop , and in 2009 three @entity64 officers died during a domestic disturbance call at the home of a gun - obsessed neo-nazi . today 's violent right - wing extremists often operate on the fringes of existing groups or social networks , where they gain inspiration and a belief system in lieu of directives or an actual rank or " membership " card . while many of these favored groups are extremist , some are not . @entity82 , who police said carried out the @entity2 attack with his wife , @entity85 , reportedly went to the @entity19 ranch militia protests and even posted a picture of a meeting he had with an extremist conspiracist on his web page . he also used a flag popular with the right at the crime scene and " liked " various mainstream political groups such as the @entity95 , whose executive vice president called federal agents " jack - booted thugs " during the heyday of the 1990s militia movement , on his @entity103 page . his posted manifesto contains overheated versions of themes that could fit into a mainstream political speech , with its vow to fight tyranny . to be sure , mainstream groups in politics countenance reform , not murder , but the often - shrill rhetoric , conspiracy theories and innuendo they sometimes promote may have consequences . @entity118 , a popular radio personality of the far right , went so far as to accuse the federal government of staging the @entity2 incident for political gain . members of law enforcement are among the most visible and active civic officials to interact directly with the public , so their symbolism and proximity make them targets for those who hate and loathe the government . moreover , many police interactions involve emotionally tense situations , making law enforcement susceptible not only to premeditated violence but spontaneous attacks as well . extremists , unlike political players , have opted out of accepting the peaceful processes and institutions of our pluralistic democracy . the @entity2 killers had not only targeted officers as a tyrannical enemy but may have planned an attack on a courthouse as well . when we engage in political debate , we have to be mindful that the embers of dissatisfaction with government can fly and land on violent and sometimes unstable people who rely on conspiracy theories as an anesthetic for either personal failures or emotional frustrations .	@entity22:Gadsden " Do n't Tread on Me Flag	@entity2:Las Vegas	@entity5:Samaritan	@entity11:America	@entity30:Symbionese Liberation Army	@entity64:Pittsburgh	@entity29:Weather Underground	@entity19:Bundy	@entity44:Southern Poverty Law Center	@entity82:Jerad Milller	@entity103:Facebook	@entity85:Amanda	@entity42:Patriot	@entity12:Department of Justice	@entity95:National Rifle Association	@entity58:West Memphis	@entity157:Levin	@entity59:Arkansas	@entity31:Black Liberation Army	@entity118:Alex Jones
@placeholder had sex with followers , abused drugs and cursed at church members	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- the key to understanding the tragedy that was @entity3 lies in the oratory skills of the @entity6 founder , @entity5 . " he was very charismatic , " @entity7 , a @entity3 survivor , says of the rev. @entity5 . with the cadence and fervor of a baptist preacher , the charm and folksiness of a country storyteller and the zeal and fury of a maniacal dictator , @entity5 exhorted his followers to a fever pitch , audiotapes recovered from @entity3 reveal . as he spoke , they applauded , shouted , cheered . one follower who survived the " revolutionary suicide " at @entity3 on november 18 , 1978 , said that @entity5 was the most dynamic speaker he had ever heard . like all powerful speakers , @entity5 ' greatest asset was his ability to determine what listeners wanted to hear and give it to them in simple language that appealed to them on an almost instinctual level . " he was very charismatic , very charismatic , " said @entity35 , who survived that fateful day in @entity3 by walking away from the settlement before the cyanide that killed more than 900 @entity6 members was distributed . she was one of 33 people who began the day in @entity3 and lived to tell the tale . " he could quote scripture and turn around and preach socialism , " she said . " he appealed to anyone on any level at any time . " hear @entity5 declare " i am @entity45 " » many of his followers were elderly african - americans drawn to his cause by his soulful delivery and pentecostal preaching style , including at times speaking in tongues . that hair - raising fervor was perhaps only overshadowed by what he said . " when i say , i am @entity45 , then i feel [ faith ] well up within my soul . and i see it well up in you , and i see the sick healed , and the blind see , and the dead raised . ... you wan na know how i feel , i never feel so good as when i say i am @entity45 , " he shouted in a full - throated roar in a 1972 sermon . @entity5 further enraptured crowds with faith healings -- laying hands on disabled or sick people who would miraculously be cured of any ailments . though insiders later revealed that these healings were staged , @entity5 ' mastery of word and presentation left few in attendance with any doubts about his abilities . he also indoctrinated many young , idealistic liberal white people in progressive 1970s @entity81 with the themes of socialism , equality and political activism . and he justified his brand of socialism with the @entity87 for those recruited from more conservative religious factions , who might have found such left - wing ideas tough to swallow . " the only ethic by which we can lift mankind today is some form of socialism , " he said in another 1972 sermon . " there 's a smattering of it in the , in the @entity100 . it 's very evidently clear on the day of @entity102 that they that believed were together and had all things common . " socialism , he said , is " older than the @entity87 by far . " but by the time @entity5 and many of his followers completed a lengthy relocation from @entity81 to @entity3 in @entity110 in 1977 , he had begun to change as a speaker . his trademark passionate delivery gave way to blind fury and incredible rage . listen to the rage of @entity5 » " i been tired for 25 years , " the 47 - year - old @entity5 preached in 1978 , his voice rising steadily in pitched anger . " i 'm tired of looking at people 's faces that do n't give a f --- for 25 years , i watch and they do n't give a g --- --- . you can lay it out in front of them , and they will not listen . they will not read . they will not do anything , and that 's why i have to suffer every day and all night and all through the hours , because i will have nobody but a few that will carry the burden with me . because you hide yourself away in ignorance . " his rages created a fear that cemented the hold he had on his followers . he also used a " divide and conquer " method among his followers . " what @entity5 did was try to break all ties that were not to him , " said former believer @entity143 . " transfer all that loyalty , all that bonding to him . and so families were broken apart . relationships were divided . " such divisions caused family members to spy and report on one another , or friends to turn in friends for various transgressions . @entity5 furthered the poisonous atmosphere among his followers by encouraging physical fighting to either solve problems or administer punishment . audiotapes of such sessions reveal @entity5 laughing , apparently entertained . @entity5 ' mastery of the spoken word also enabled his many sexual exploits with both female and male followers . @entity5 deftly justified his actions to his followers by saying that what he did to them was actually for their own benefit , or the benefit of making the church a stronger , tighter - knit organization . he preached that many of his male followers were in denial about their homosexuality , conditioning those followers to accept him if he approached with a sexual advance . and he defused any accusations of sexual perversion on his part by claiming that he gained no personal pleasure from his acts , which he called a " great sacrifice . " " and if the leader is attracted to you , then somehow that cultivates , " @entity5 said during a temple meeting in 1978 . " well , you ought to know i 'm attracted to you , i 'm ready to die for every one of you , so that means i 'm attracted to you . you follow what i 'm saying ? i 'm attracted to all of you . how much more attraction can you have than to be ready to have your eyes plucked out ? " by the end at @entity3 , @entity5 was more rock star than preacher . his sermons and remarks at meetings were littered with obscenities . he regularly had sex with his followers and he abused drugs . by the last month of @entity3 's existence , @entity5 was so intoxicated at times that he had great difficulty even reading the news aloud to his followers . as the end drew near , @entity5 ' tone as a speaker took darker turns . he constantly fed his followers in @entity110 a steady diet of fatalism . " i said , life is a f --- --- disease , " he said . " it 's worse than cancer . it 's a disease . and there 's only one cure for the sonofabitchin ' disease . that 's death . and socialists can only take one form of death . what is it ? fight a goddamn war , or revolutionary suicide . if you do n't believe life 's a disease , then you 're dumb . very dumb . " spurred on by their leader 's talk , @entity6 members were ready to follow @entity5 even into death . at his request , they even wrote personal notes to him expressing their willingness to die for their cause . some followers willing to die » this was the ultimate test of loyalty , and the absolute testimony to the power of his words . as history shows , @entity5 the orator was chillingly effective . listen to final 45 minutes at @entity3 »	@entity3:Jonestown	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Leslie Wilson	@entity6:Peoples Temple	@entity5:Jones	@entity45:God	@entity87:Bible	@entity100:New Testament	@entity81:California	@entity102:Pentecost	@entity110:Guyana	@entity7:Leslie Wagner-Wilson	@entity143:Vernon Gosney

@entity9 says @entity3 leadership told him to call @placeholder , apologize	@entity83	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity3 congressman from @entity4 who shouted out during president @entity6 's health care address to @entity7 insisted thursday that his outburst was " spontaneous .

@placeholder officials gave @entity4 additional direction for tests	@entity22	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- equipment that the oil company @entity4 was using to help stop the massive oil gusher in the @entity6 is leaking -- another setback for the beleaguered company in its hope of stopping this disaster . the company will need to fix the leak before it can run crucial tests that could show whether an end finally is in sight to the environmental disaster , the company said . there was no timetable for when the leak was to be fixed , a company spokesman said early thursday morning . earlier , @entity4 was proceeding with the critical test of its crippled well in the @entity6 . the @entity22 government had told @entity4 tuesday to proceed with the " integrity " test on the well in the @entity6 , and @entity4 had begun the process of shutting off valves on its new capping stack , to see whether the well can hold the pressure . it 's hoped the tests , whenever they begin , will show whether the well can be contained -- either by closing the 30 - foot , 75 - ton cap stack or siphoning off oil to the surface . that could signal a beginning of an end to the catastrophe that began when the @entity42 drilling rig exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill . but even if the well is contained , the cleanup could take years . retired adm. @entity46 , who is heading the government 's response to the oil spill , announced wednesday the test had been given a green light , after it was delayed for a day so that procedures could be scrutinized . he said that after intense consultations with energy secretary @entity56 and other scientists involved , " at this time we 'll be releasing an order to @entity4 to proceed with the well integrity test . but we gave them some additional direction to make sure we were are taking due care and in some cases an overabundance of caution , to make sure we did n't do any irreversible harm to the well as we proceed . " @entity46 said the officials " sat long and hard about delaying the test " and it was " not easy " to decide to delay . he said they wanted to make sure they 're " getting this right " for this " significant event . " @entity46 added the earlier delay was not prompted by the @entity73 . " we advised the @entity73 that we decided to take a 24 - hour break . it was us advising them that we thought it was the right thing to do . we briefed them , " he said . @entity4 's senior vice president @entity80 reported shortly after @entity46 spoke that the middle valve of the three - valve stack had been closed . that 's an initial step in the complicated process of closing off the well and checking pressure to see how it 's holding . a key question was whether shutting the well was worth the risk , or whether it might damage the well bore . @entity46 said the test would be a stop - and - go process . it involves incrementally closing three valves on the new cap while testing pressure , a process that could unfold could over two days . higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped , while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well . it was not clear early thursday if the new leak was discovered by a lower pressure reading . the massive cap , which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well , is about three stories high and weighs 160,000 pounds . if the well ca n't be shut off completely , oil could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface . the @entity114 and @entity115 currently are at the surface , but it might take several weeks before two more ships can be brought in to contain all the flow . @entity46 said a four - vessel system could recover up to 80,000 barrels ( 3.3 million gallons ) a day , more than the high - end estimates of the well 's flow rate . scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels ( 1.4 to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have spewed daily from @entity4 's breached well . @entity80 said the @entity114 is ramping up production and recovered about 9,200 barrels ( 386,400 gallons ) on tuesday . the test is called an integrity test because it is aimed at ensuring the well bore has enough integrity to hold the pressure in the well when it is closed . " in this exercise , high pressure is good , " @entity46 said . " we are looking for somewhere between 8 - and 9,000 [ pounds per square inch ] inside the capping stack , which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore 's being able to withstand that pressure . " @entity46 said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six - hour time frame , that could signal problems with the new cap . meanwhile , two relief wells are seen as the ultimate solution to the oil disaster . they 're expected to be completed in august . @entity80 had said tuesday that work on the relief wells was being delayed while officials prepared for the integrity test , noting that " it 's a good precaution to take . " but @entity46 said wednesday in his briefing the government has n't ordered @entity4 to halt work on the relief wells . " they are going very slowly . they have n't stopped , " he said . he did say that operations on the second relief well were temporarily suspended at a depth of 15,963 feet to ensure there is no interference with the first relief well . the second relief well is a backup to the first . when the relief well does intercept the crippled well , heavy mud and then cement would be pumped in to seal it permanently . @entity46 cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work , there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from @entity1 to @entity179 . " there 's still a significant amount of oil out there , and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore , tar balls , beach cleanup , and then we will be ... trying to understand the long - term environmental / ecological impact of the event , " he said . @entity2 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .	@entity22:U.S.	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Louisiana	@entity0:New Orleans	@entity6:Gulf of Mexico	@entity4:BP	@entity179:Florida	@entity196:Jamie Morrison	@entity195:John King	@entity198:Scott Thompson	@entity46:Allen	@entity80:Wells	@entity197:Vivian Kuo	@entity115:Q4000	@entity114:Helix Producer	@entity56:Steven Chu	@entity42:Deepwater Horizon	@entity201:Leak	@entity73:White House
@entity8 became first @placeholder woman to win @entity18 gold in track and field	@entity20	( @entity1 ) it 's a story that could have borrowed some of its plot from a @entity6 movie , but audiences might have scoffed at the improbable ending @entity8 achieved in real life . a script containing some classic storytelling themes -- poor rural upbringing , family tragedy , arranged marriages and political ambitions -- was afforded its defining element when @entity8 put in an historic performance at the @entity18 held in 2010 . in the entire 80 - year history of the quadrennial sporting jamboree , no @entity20 female had ever claimed gold in a track and field event until @entity8 snatched a momentous victory in the women 's discus . her winning throw of 61.51 meters led an @entity20 clean sweep in the event ( compatriots @entity32 and @entity33 took silver and bronze respectively ) and also ensured @entity20 's first win in the athletics stadium since the runner @entity38 , known as " the @entity38 , " dashed to gold in the men 's 440 yards at the @entity18 held in @entity40 , @entity42 way back in 1958 . " i can never forget that moment when i won the gold medal and when i took the victory lap with the flag , " @entity8 told @entity1 's @entity46 series . " for four years i was seeing the moment in my dreams and now i was finally seeing it in reality , " she added wiping away tears from her eyes . @entity8 could be forgiven for welling up given her journey from provincial backwater to a packed stadium in @entity59 . born in the small town of @entity61 in the state of @entity63 , @entity8 was brought up in by her father and grandmother after her mother died when she was just nine years old . living among the @entity69 people -- a traditional agricultural community in northern @entity20 -- @entity8 recalls a childhood where physical fitness was honed working the land not at play on a sports field . " most people are agriculturalist and their routine is to get up early and feed the livestock and after breakfast they leave for the fields , " she explains . " my family had a milk dairy and we had around 70 - 80 buffalo . the work of the milking was only done by the family ... and when i was ( 15 - 16 years old ) i would help , milking seven to eight buffaloes in one go . " @entity90 afforded something of a respite from this routine as well as providing an outlet for her growing interest in sport which was exercised further as she continued her formal education . " when i got to college i used to compete with the other girls . my height and strength was good -- i could throw well , " she explains . it was during this time that she got married , but rather than strangling her sporting ambitions , wedlock set them free . " in our community we mostly have arranged marriages , but by the grace of god or luck my husband was a sportsman , " she said . @entity116 had been a promising junior hammer thrower who had won medals at @entity120 before injury forced him into early retirement . but when he married @entity8 his sporting energies were revitalized as he applied himself to the role of husband and coach . " after getting married to @entity116 , i got to learn a lot -- he knew about the @entity129 , the @entity130 and knew what it meant to win medals ... " she said . " when he told me about it i thought that i should be a part of it as well . " with his knowledge and his unflinching support -- " he had 100 % belief in me , " she says -- @entity8 set about trying to achieve her newly - discovered sporting goals . there were setbacks along the way -- a back injury in 2000 almost finished her career and the birth of a son the following year meant she had to juggle parental responsibilities alongside training - but her commitment paid off in the long run . bronze medals at the 2006 and 2010 @entity129 preceded her historic gold medal performance at the @entity18 . more records were broken two years later at the @entity130 when @entity8 became the first @entity20 woman ever to reach the @entity156 discus final , eventually finishing a creditable sixth . the 32 - year - old has since used her sporting fame to good effect away from the discus circle helping the @entity164 state @entity162 in their campaigns to curb the ongoing curse of female foeticide . the selective abortion of female fetuses is a continuing problem in @entity20 , and is particularly prevalent in @entity63 where @entity8 grew up , according to @entity171 . she has also been actively involved in trying to improve sporting facilities for children in @entity175 , where she lives with husband and their 13 - year - old son , and across the country . " if you see the schools we have in @entity20 there is no ground or fields for the kids to play in . physical ( education ) is n't given much importance . it is said that childhood grows as you play and that 's how sport starts , " she says . " i came from a village . if i can reach ( the top ) level then why ca n't other girls from villages do that , " she says . @entity8 's attentions have switched to politics in recent years , joining the center - left @entity203 -- headed by @entity205 -- in 2013 and it looks like the final chapters of her sporting script may be being penned now , although she 's keen to compete at the @entity210 next year . but the narrative that seeks to re-write traditional attitudes towards women in wider @entity20 society is only just beginning . " for a very long time , the culture of our country has been a very male dominating one and the male child has been given a lot of importance , " she says . " until the time we are not able to abolish the discrimination of a boy and a girl within the family this thing will continue -- ( a child 's ) thinking develops from this situation . " @entity8 also advocates that dowries -- which are officially banned in @entity20 , though gifts to grooms and his family are still common -- should be put towards a girl 's education so " she is able to stand on her own two feet , " she says . " they say the first teacher is the mother . if she is educated she will give good virtues to her children she can change the atmosphere of her house . the base of our society starts from there .

@placeholder says " allegations are completely baseless "	@entity17	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- a federal hearing began monday to determine whether @entity0 should be charged with a willful violation in the 2010 death of killer whale trainer @entity6 . as witnesses took the stand inside the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity1 , members of @entity8 , or @entity8 , demonstrated outside . monday was the first day of the hearing , which will resume at 9 a.m. tuesday and is expected to continue all week . in february 2010 , as park guests watched in horror , @entity6 , 40 , was pulled into a @entity17 pool and drowned by a 12,000 - pound killer whale named @entity19 . @entity6 had been sitting on the @entity21 's pool edge during a private show . after a lengthy investigation , the @entity23 -- the federal agency that works to prevent workplace injuries -- cited @entity17 of @entity1 in august 2010 for willfully endangering employees by not taking proper safety precautions . " @entity17 recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals , " @entity28 , @entity23 's @entity29 regional administrator , said in a statement . " nonetheless , it required its employees to work within the pool wall , on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals , " she said . the citation said the park allowed its employees to work with @entity19 , a whale with " known aggressive tendencies " who was involved in the 1991 death of a trainer at a @entity49 , @entity50 , marine park . the theme park did not provide barriers , decking , oxygen supply systems or other types of protection for the trainers , @entity23 said . @entity17 spokeswoman @entity58 disagreed , saying , " these allegations are completely baseless , unsupported by any evidence or precedent , and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care . " @entity17 contested @entity23 's findings and is presenting evidence to the @entity68 , a separate government agency , at this week 's hearing in @entity12 , northeast of @entity0 . @entity23 review committee administrative judge @entity70 is presiding over the hearing , in which both sides are presenting evidence and witness testimony . in his opening remarks on monday , @entity23 attorney @entity76 said @entity17 allowed their trainers to take a calculated risk by working with killer whales that have the potential to cause harm or death to those who get close . trainers are required to sign a document that acknowledges that they have read the standard operating procedure manual and acknowledge the calculated risk . @entity76 called the document a release waiver and argued that the park 's training for the handlers was not enough . @entity17 's attorney said the handlers ' training is only one component , noting that the animals are trained , too . " it goes hand in hand , " said @entity98 . it 's unclear if @entity23 's attorneys will present surveillance video showing @entity6 's death . her relatives have fought to keep it sealed . @entity108 district judge @entity107 on thursday denied the @entity6 family 's request to keep the tape from being released or used at the hearing . " we can not comment on what may or may not be presented ( during the hearing ) , as that depends not only on our own attorneys but also on any rulings issued by the judge in the case , " @entity23 spokesman @entity113 said . since the accident , @entity17 has restricted all trainers from entering the water with killer whales until further notice , though @entity19 has returned in a theme park show called " @entity128 .

@placeholder is accused of engaging in sex with young boys	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- for most of the 37 years between 1963 and 2000 , @entity1 was the epitome of a @entity4 man . that shining image dimmed over the weekend , when police arrested him on seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and other charges , including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child . @entity1 , 67 , allegedly engaged in fondling , oral sex and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years , according to an investigative state grand jury 's summary of testimony . he maintains he is innocent . @entity4 head football coach @entity21 spoke for many in the community when he called the string of sexual child abuse charges against @entity1 " shocking . " the charges put a whole new spin on the title of his autobiography , " touched : the @entity30 . " published in 2001 , the book explores @entity1 's career and his involvement in children 's charities . a starting defensive end for the @entity37 for three years , @entity1 went on to spend all but two years of his coaching career working the sidelines for @entity4 , most of them as defensive coordinator . the university has called @entity1 " largely responsible for @entity4 earning the moniker ' @entity45 , ' with 10 of his linebackers earning first - team @entity49 honors . " eleven years ago , he retired to focus more attention on @entity51 , the program he had founded for troubled youth . but he still maintained ties to the university , continuing as a volunteer with the athletic department 's life skills and outreach programs . " football coaching has been a wonderful career because it has brought me into contact with so many exceptional young people , " @entity1 said in a statement at the time , released by the university . " the opportunity to impact the lives of the many student - athletes who 've come through the program has been one of the great rewards for me . @entity4 football is special because of the sense of family established by those associated with the program today and those players , coaches and staff who 've been part of it over the years . " retiring as an active coach will permit me to devote more time to @entity51 . as the organization has grown , the demands for my hands - on involvement have increased dramatically . the staff has done a marvelous job of building the organization , which now touches more than 150,000 children annually through eight different programs . i 'm anxious to devote my full - time energies to expanding the reach and influence of @entity51 in a day and age when more and more kids seem to be at risk . " " i always felt that @entity1 had two loves : one was obviously his ability , his wanting to help younger people in @entity51 and being a head coach , " @entity21 said in a 2008 news conference .

" in his book , @entity1 writes of his " unusual life . " " my time on this earth has always been unique , " he writes . " at the times when i found myself searching for maturity , i usually came up with insanity . that 's the way it is in the life of @entity1 . " he writes about people who have touched his life . " i wish , sometimes , that i could press a button to bring back the times when life was so much simpler with the kids . the times when they did n't worry about what they were missing with drugs , alcohol and sex , " he writes . " they did n't have to worry about protection from @entity131 and @entity132 . they enjoyed life 's simple pleasures in a naive time ; a time of make - believe . there were simple activities and worthwhile outlets . people just enjoyed each other simply as people .

@placeholder denies murder , says he believed @entity109 was an intruder	@entity8	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- judging by the ferocity with which @entity5 pursued a case of " planned and premeditated " murder against @entity8 at his bail hearing , it would not be unreasonable to assume the state had a strong case . from the outset , however , the veracity of the state 's case appeared to dwindle . at the bail hearing in february , the then - lead investigator @entity16 crumbled on the stand and had to concede that there was little appreciable evidence gathered to back up the state 's claims . worse , he admitted serious breaches of investigation protocol , including the failure to wear protective foot coverings at the crime scene , thereby contaminating certain forensic evidence . @entity16 also had to concede that @entity8 ' version of events was not implausible . this of course did not help @entity8 in the court of public opinion , as once the state 's sensational claims were made they were immediately disseminated around the world . nonetheless , much of the state 's case was castigated by @entity38 in his unusually long bail decision . adding to the perception that the state 's case is floundering , on tuesday , rather than presenting their charges to which @entity8 would plead , the state requested a two - month postponement to conduct further investigations . this equivocation is in stark contrast to their initial aggression at the bail proceedings . the most interesting part of the postponement hearing was the stark warning the magistrate issued to the media and the state to act responsibly and avoid " scandalising the sanctity of justice " through a " trial by media . " read more : pistorius judge warns of ' trial by media ' clearly he was referring to the leaked photographs of the crime scene which were recently published . the leaking of these pictures , as well as reports in local newspapers that numerous police cell phones have subsequently been confiscated , adds to the perception that the state is mismanaging this case . this begs the question : considering a litany of state missteps and the wild public speculation triggered at the bail proceedings , can @entity8 get a fair trial ? regarding his eventual trial in a court of law , the answer is clearly " yes . " @entity1 abandoned trial by jury in 1969 . @entity8 ' trial will thus be presided over by either a regional magistrate or a high court judge , possibly assisted by assessors . judicial officers in @entity1 are highly skilled and experienced and are keenly aware of their responsibility to apply the law in an impartial manner , guided by the evidence presented in court , not discussions occurring outside court . this much was inherently acknowledged by the magistrate 's warning yesterday -- he did not focus on the fairness of the trial being damaged but rather the sanctity of the justice system being called into disrepute . read more : photos show @entity109 's transformation however , @entity8 is unlikely to fare as well in the court of public opinion . to many @entity1 @entity112 ' story of triumph over adversity came to symbolize the country 's own story . his personal fallibility has thus touched an uncomfortable nerve , reminding the country of its own fallibility , and leading to an angry backlash . to this segment of society @entity8 is already guilty of murder -- irrespective of what the evidence ends up revealing . the state 's bungles have only served to fuel the determination of @entity8 naysayers : if he is acquitted of murder it will not be put down to the fact that he was telling the truth , but because the state dropped the ball . this stance fails to acknowledge that even the best - run cases can result in an acquittal when the facts , as revealed through the evidence gathered , end up supporting an acquittal . so where does the evidence currently point ? it is simply too soon to tell . what we can ascertain is what evidence is likely to become pivotal . for example , the question of whether or not @entity8 was wearing his prosthetics is critical . thus the ballistics evidence will be critical . the state appears to be relying on a contention that he took the time to put on his prosthetics before firing through the bathroom door . this , they claim , shows premeditation . read more : @entity8 heartbroken , uncle says the defence has claimed he was not wearing his prosthetics , which left him feeling particularly vulnerable to a suspected intruder , thus flooding him with fear . the evidence at trial will eventually support one of these versions over the other . before that evidence is offered in court , the public can not be clairvoyant -- despite firmly held beliefs either way , we simply do n't yet have enough information to know the truth . this is the purpose of a criminal trial , it is essentially a truth - finding mission and the rules of evidence and procedure are set up to enhance this . @entity16 , now retired from the police service , would do well to remind himself of this . he has given interviews to the media vociferously claiming @entity8 ' guilt and affirming that he will be called at trial to testify for the state . with respect , more is required than a policeman 's hunch to convict a person of murder . if he is trying to serve the interests of justice , rather than merely grinding an axe , he would do well to stop talking to the media and save his words for court . read more : who is ' @entity8 ' @entity8 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:South Africans	@entity0:Cape Town	@entity5:Gerrie Nel	@entity16:Hilton Botha	@entity38:Magistrate Nair	@entity8:Pistorius	@entity112:Pistorius	@entity109:Steenkamp	@entity207:Paralympian Oscar Pistorius	@entity205:Phelps
@placeholder 's @entity10 said it was the most bloodshed he 'd seen over the past six weeks	@entity1	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity4 security forces stormed two sit - ins orchestrated by supporters of ousted president @entity7 early wednesday , bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds of protesters , @entity1 correspondents say . at a makeshift hospital , @entity1 's @entity10 described walking through the blood of the injured . " we have witnessed scores of injured brought on stretchers before us . many of them were in bad shape . it looked like many of them had been shot , " he said . " i have personally never seen this much bloodshed in what , according to what we 've seen over the past six weeks , had been a peaceful demonstration . " @entity4 's interim government and @entity7 's @entity26 are reporting scores of people have been killed in what 's being dubbed the country 's bloodiest day since the 2011 revolution . @entity1 correspondents described bloody scenes as security forces clash with @entity7 supporters . " i think what we 're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very , very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets , " @entity1 's @entity35 reported . the @entity4 raid : at a glance arriving earlier at one of the entrances to the @entity50 encampment , @entity10 said the scene resembled " a war zone . " thick plumes of black smoke were rising through the air from where it was understood security forces had entered the area and @entity60 supporters were facing off against those forces , he said . protesters were breaking bricks and gunfire could be heard , while tear gas was filling the air . " up above there are military helicopters and this is just an all - out fight and i think this is what a lot of people were concerned about -- this kind of violent scene , " he said . " there 's heavy tear gas being used . a lot of people are emotional , we 've seen women cry , we 've seen people appear to lose consciousness because of the tear gas and now we just wait to see what happens . " this is going to be an incredibly difficult demonstration to clear out . not like ( the @entity85 ) that was cleared out earlier today by security forces -- this is a much larger sit - in . " as @entity10 spoke to @entity1 , he described protesters barricading the street where his television crew had arrived and where fighting had broken out . it was unclear whether the clash had involved security forces or residents opposed to the sit - in , he said . " that 's not unusual for residents who are against the @entity26 -- against the former president -- to get in on these fights . " the protesters appeared to be surrounded on all sides , he said . " this is the most intense gunfire that i 've personally heard during these clashes over the past six weeks . clearly some of it automatic weapons , some of it sounds like it 's coming from rooftops . " i have n't seen any weapons on this side -- i have n't seen any protesters firing weapons but they are breaking bricks , throwing rocks -- it 's not clear what they 're throwing at . but there 's a lot of chaos here . " two hours later , @entity10 said the outcome of the gunfight had been " incredibly bloody . " " over the hours we 've seen one body after another pass through to a makeshift clinic . " @entity4 explained : 6 key questions on the other side of the square , @entity128 said riot police had been firing tear gas " as groups of @entity60 demonstrators tried to break through police lines to join the encampment . " military units could be seen behind the riot police , she said . " at least four ambulances passed through the police lines on their way toward the site of the sit - in . two members of the security forces could be seen being put into the ambulances . " @entity128 and her team later moved to another entrance to the square after experiencing some hostility . " there were a few individuals in the crowd who were very anti-western , anti-american , getting very aggressive toward the @entity1 team . " other individuals in the crowd were helping us to pull back from that situation , " she said . @entity128 and her team later came under fire while she was reporting live on @entity1 . three other journalists were later reported shot , two fatally , while covering the unrest . one of those killed was @entity167 , a former @entity1 cameraman who had been working for @entity168 for the past 15 years . in the chaos of the raids , it has been impossible for @entity1 to verify the claims and counterclaims of protester casualties . @entity175 reported that at least 149 people had been killed and more than 1,400 wounded . the @entity26 said earlier that 200 @entity7 supporters were killed and more than 8,000 were injured . but the party has given exaggerated figures in the past , only to revise them later .	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Cairo	@entity26:Muslim Brotherhood	@entity167:Mick Deane	@entity7:Morsy	@entity10:Reza Sayah	@entity168:Sky News	@entity4:Egyptian	@entity50:Rabaa al-Adawiya Square	@entity35:Arwa Damon	@entity85:Nahda camp	@entity128:Damon	@entity175:State TV	@entity60:pro-Morsy
the double amputee insists that he mistook @placeholder for an intruder	@entity38	@entity1 did n't consciously pull the trigger the night he shot and killed his girlfriend , the sprinter testified at his murder trial tuesday . the @entity6 and @entity7 athlete said he was " overcome with a sense of terror and vulnerability " before he shot through a closed bathroom door last year , fearing an intruder was inside . defense attorney @entity13 asked his client what he meant when he referred to the shooting as an " accident . " " i mean the situation , and the situation as a whole , it was n't meant to be , " @entity1 said . the double amputee said he was terrified when he heard the sound of the toilet door opening . " i did n't think about pulling the trigger . as soon as i heard the noise , before i could think , i pulled the trigger , " he said . the testimony came after the prosecution ended five days of grueling cross-examination , which has seen the athlete break down on several occasions . @entity33 card @entity1 cried and his voice trembled as prosecutor @entity35 challenged his account of what happened the night he shot and killed his girlfriend , @entity38 . @entity35 asked who should be blamed for shooting his girlfriend on @entity33 2013 . " i 'm not sure , my lady , " @entity1 said , directing his answer to the judge . he repeatedly said he feared for his life and thought there was an intruder in his bathroom . a day earlier , @entity1 testified , " i blame myself for taking @entity38 's life . " he became emotional as he described finding his girlfriend slumped over by a toilet after shooting her through a closed bathroom door . " i was saying , ' baby hold on . @entity53 , please help me , ' " he said tuesday . @entity35 has accused @entity1 of " tailoring " his version of events to suit his story . he questioned @entity57 on details after the shooting that the athlete said he does n't remember , such as what exactly he did with the gun immediately afterward and who connected his cell phone to a charger in the kitchen . the prosecution contends that @entity1 shot @entity38 intentionally after a heated argument , which @entity1 has repeatedly denied . the defense ended its re-examination of @entity1 by giving the court a piece of evidence : the @entity33 card that @entity38 wrote to @entity1 . @entity1 read the card aloud .

" i 'm going to take a very deliberate process in making those decisions , " @entity2 said . " there is no immediate decision pending on resources , because one of the things that i 'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a determination about resources . " the @entity6 has about 62,000 @entity6 troops in the country , and @entity30 allies -- including @entity10 -- have another 35,000 . the @entity31 is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year . there have been indications that @entity2 soon could be asked to commit even more @entity37 troops . defense secretary @entity38 , however , has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000 - troop increase before considering whether to send more . support in the @entity6 for the war in @entity8 has dipped to an all - time low . just 39 percent of @entity6 favor the war , while 58 percent oppose it , according to a national @entity45 survey released tuesday . recent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in @entity10 . @entity2 thanked @entity9 for his country 's commitment to @entity8 , where more than 2,800 @entity10 troops and dozens of civilians are stationed . " they have fought ; they have had staying power ; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for , " he said . watch @entity2 and @entity9 meet » most of the @entity10 forces are based in the southern @entity66 province , home to some of the worst violence and instability . at least 130 @entity10 troops have been killed in the war . last year , after a national debate , the @entity10 government extended the mission -- which was to end this february -- until the end of 2011 . @entity9 said wednesday that " @entity10 is not leaving @entity8 " but is " transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011 . " the two leaders also discussed economic issues , issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that " open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in @entity88 and globally . " @entity2 acknowledged that the " @entity37 " clause in the economic stimulus package has been a " source of irritation " between @entity10 and the @entity6 and is something @entity9 has repeatedly brought to his attention . the clause is a provision in the $ 787 billion stimulus package enacted in february that states only @entity37 goods can be used in stimulus projects . but it stipulates that the measure would not override existing @entity6 trade treaties such as the @entity102 . @entity9 said @entity10 's concerns about the clause are " important irritants ... but relatively small " when compared with the overall @entity6 - @entity10 trade relationship .	@entity31:Pentagon	@entity2:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:U.S.	@entity37:American	@entity10:Canada	@entity38:Robert Gates	@entity9:Harper	@entity8:Afghanistan	@entity30:NATO	@entity45:CNN / Opinion Research Corp.	@entity102:North American Free Trade Agreement	@entity114:PM of Canada	@entity88:North America	@entity66:Kandahar

" but the @entity21 went home long before midnight , meaning nothing will get through @entity24 before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in , at least on paper . a source familiar with the deal told @entity0 that the @entity2 proposal would put off the cuts for two months and keep the expiring bush - era tax cuts for individuals earning less than $ 400,000 or couples earning less than $ 450,000 . president @entity36 has long demanded that the threshold be set at $ 250,000 . tax rates on income above those levels would go back to the @entity42 - era rate of 39.6 % , up from the current 35 % , and itemized deductions would be capped at $ 250,000 for individuals and $ 300,000 for couples . that would generate an estimated $ 600 billion in additional revenue over 10 years . taxes on inherited estates will go up to 40 % from 35 % , but the exemption will be indexed to rise with inflation -- a provision the source said was added at the insistence of moderate @entity9 . unemployment insurance would be extended for a year for for 2 million people , and the alternative minimum tax -- a perennial issue -- would be permanently adjusted for inflation . child care , tuition and research and development tax credits would be renewed . and the " @entity65 " -- reimbursements for doctors who take @entity69 patients -- will continue , but it wo n't be paid for out of the @entity36 administration 's signature health care law . @entity6 had been in negotiations with @entity2 minority leader @entity71 , @entity72 , since sunday afternoon . senate majority leader @entity73 and @entity3 minority leader @entity74 , both democrats , agreed to the plan in calls with president @entity36 , a @entity9 source said monday night . in the @entity3 , @entity80 sources said earlier monday that there 's little practical difference in settling the issue monday night versus tuesday . but if tax - averse @entity3 @entity84 approve the bill on tuesday -- when taxes have technically gone up -- they can argue they 've voted for a tax cut to bring rates back down , even after just a few hours , @entity80 sources said . that could bring some more republicans on board , one source said . economists warn the one - two punch of tax increases and spending cuts , known as " sequestration , " could push the @entity99 economy back into recession and drive unemployment back over 9 % by the end of 2013 . @entity36 had chided lawmakers for their last - minute scramble earlier monday , hitting a nerve among several @entity84 in the @entity2 . latest updates : final fiscal cliff scramble " they are close , but they 're not there yet , " he said . " and one thing we can count on with respect to this @entity24 is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you 're supposed to do , they will use that last second . " the president warned that if @entity84 think they can get future deficit reduction solely through spending cuts " that will hurt seniors , or hurt students , or hurt middle - class families without asking also equivalent sacrifice from millionaires or companies with a lot of lobbyists ... they 've got another thing coming . " that irked @entity84 senators who have been grappling for a deal with the @entity9 majority in that chamber . sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , called the president 's comments " very unbecoming of where we are at this moment " and added , " my heart 's still pounding . " " i know the president has fun heckling @entity24 , " @entity139 said . " i think he lost probably numbers of votes with what he did .

" in its place , the @entity2 plan would use $ 12 billion in new tax revenue to replace half the expected deficit reduction from the sequester and leave another $ 12 billion in spending cuts , split half - and - half between defense and domestic programs . read more : @entity69 patients may suffer if country goes over fiscal cliff despite @entity36 's backing , one leading @entity2 @entity206 warned a deal could run into trouble -- not only from @entity210 who have long opposed any tax increase , but also from liberals in the @entity2 who oppose allowing more high - income households to escape a tax increase . " no deal is better than a bad deal , and this looks like a very bad deal the way this is shaping up , " sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , said monday morning . late in the day , nothing had changed that would cause him to support the package . conservative lobbyist @entity227 , whose @entity228 pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes , said the plan " right now , as explained " would preserve most of the @entity234 tax cuts and would n't violate his group 's pledge . " take the 84 % of your winnings off the table , " @entity227 told @entity0 . " we spent 12 years getting the @entity9 to cede those tax cuts to the @entity99 people . take them off the table . then we go back and argue about making the tax cuts permanent for everyone . " but @entity247 , who served as labor secretary in the @entity42 administration , said the $ 450,000 threshold " means the lion 's share of the burden of deficit reduction falls on the middle class , either in terms of higher taxes down the road or fewer government services . " in addition , he said , the plan does nothing to raise the federal debt ceiling just as the federal government bumps up against its borrowing limit . and that , @entity80 sen. @entity265 told @entity0 , is likely to be " a whole new field of battle . " " we just added 2.1 trillion in the last increase in the debt ceiling , and spending continues to go up , " @entity265 said .

@placeholder and top democrats are seeking coverage for 46 million @entity32	@entity20	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- in 1994 , universal health care was a key policy plan for then - president @entity4 . it eventually failed . in 1993 , president @entity4 and first lady @entity6 listen to a man 's story about health care problems . now , 15 years later , another @entity11 president is taking on the challenge , but facing an uphill battle from not only from @entity14 , but from members of his own party . will failing to reform health care have the same consequences for @entity20 's administration as it did for @entity4 's ? like @entity20 , @entity4 came into office with reforming the nation 's health care system as one of his top priorities . then - first lady @entity6 , who headed the administration 's task force on reforming the system , delivered a 1,000 - page plan that was dubbed " @entity31 , " which required @entity32 and permanent resident aliens to enroll in a health plan . other provisions included @entity32 below a certain income level paying nothing for care . republicans decried the plan as overcomplicated and used it to tag the administration as big government - loving , tax - and - spend liberals . the plan 's failure emboldened @entity14 and led to huge @entity11 losses in the 1994 midterm elections , allowing the @entity14 to take control of @entity49 and stymie other @entity4 initiatives . now , 15 years later , @entity20 potentially faces a similar fate . @entity20 seeks the overhaul to ensure that health insurance is available to the 46 million @entity32 currently without coverage while preventing costs to both the government and individuals from continuing to climb . watch more on the health care debate » the president had set a deadline for passage of a bill before the august congressional recess , but in an interview monday with @entity67 's @entity66 , the president said that if @entity49 tells him it 's " going to spill over by a few days or a week , " that 's fine . ireport.com : weigh in on the health care debate a senior @entity71 official adds that while there is a " long way to go " in coming up with legislation , there is a true effort being made to devise a bipartisan plan . see how the plans compare » " [ the @entity80 ] is working in a bipartisan way and despite all of the cacophony of attacks you 've heard from some @entity14 , i think you 've got to give some credit to the @entity14 on the finance committee who are making right now a good faith effort , despite pressure , probably from their own party , to work with @entity11 to try to come up with something that people can get behind , " said @entity71 communications director @entity79 on wednesday . sen. @entity94 , @entity95 , says in order for health care reform to get passed , it will take a well - coordinated bipartisan effort . " i think the president is right . he really does want a bipartisan effort . and that 's what it 's going to take for it to be for the @entity32 people . but the approach to it is kind of like a doctor practicing bad medicine where you fix only symptoms and do n't treat the disease . ... the disease is only going to get worse . " but the battle over health care reform is weighed down by complex problems , competing interests , a $ 1 trillion price tag , conservative democrats in sticker shock and @entity14 sensing an opportunity to regain some of the power they lost in the 2006 congressional elections . conservative @entity125 wrote in his blog that there is an opportunity to inflict political damage to the president and that opponents should n't compromise : " my advice , for what it 's worth : resist the temptation , " @entity125 wrote . " this is no time to pull punches . go for the kill . " the @entity71 has so far resisted another idea for raising revenue -- creating a tax on the medical benefits provided by employers . @entity145 chairman @entity144 said he likes the idea , but @entity20 said it could be too disruptive to a system in which 180 million @entity32 have health coverage provided by their employers . but while @entity20 has remained mostly popular in national polls so far , support for his health care plan has begun to wane . a @entity1 @entity153 released wednesday indicates that less than half the country approves of how he 's handling the issue . forty - seven percent in the poll approve of how the president is dealing with health care reform , with 44 percent disapproving . the poll averaged the three most recent national surveys that asked about @entity20 's performance on health care : @entity166 / @entity165 ( july 17 - 19 ) ; @entity168 / @entity167 ( july 15 - 18 ) and @entity169 ( july 9 - 12 ) . meanwhile , @entity94 -- a fierce opponent of the current plans being worked up in @entity49 -- says that @entity49 needs to slow down . " getting this right is better than meeting a political deadline ... i want him to back off the timeline , " he said . " let 's start over ... let 's fix it all and do it in a way that the @entity32 people wo n't charge it to their grandkids . " @entity1 senior political analyst @entity183 , who has worked under several administrations , including @entity4 's , says there 's is concern that @entity20 may be trying to ram health care legislation through @entity49 as he did with the economic stimulus plan . " and they [ @entity32 ] do n't have a lot of confidence in the past effort in the stimulus plan to put together something comprehensive and -- ' here we go again ' ... something that looks like it 's being thrown together to many people in the public . so they 're not confident that they want it . and @entity94 's argument -- along with nearly all congressional @entity14 ' -- could pose a risk to @entity20 's political capital with @entity32 . @entity183 agrees . " i think he 's got two other problems : one is that he does n't have a firm plan to sell . ... second thing is , from his point of view , there are many in the public that 'd like to hear from him and also like to see just how he 's negotiating the plan , " he said . " what they look for is a leadership that says , ' here 's where we 're going to go , ' not a leadership that says , ' i 'm urging @entity49 to make more progress ' " former senate majority leader @entity225 , who @entity20 had tapped to be @entity227 director and the point person on health care reform before tax problems derailed his nomination , said getting health care reform passed now will be a major factor in defining @entity20 's presidency . " because he 's made it such an issue , and because he has invested so much personal time and effort , this will , more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far , be a measure of his clout and of his success early on , " @entity225 was quoted in the @entity235 .

@placeholder project is regenerating a 35 - kilometer loop of land around the city	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- architect @entity2 has lived in @entity0 , @entity3 for more than 20 years , watching the city grow as it strives to compete among the world 's finest . " great cities are great places to live and they 're really vibrant and diverse , " @entity2 said . " @entity0 has a lot of those qualities , but it really needs to be sort of kick - started and prepare for the future . " with a growth in suburban sprawl in recent decades , @entity0 has acquired a reputation for unbearable traffic and poor public transportation . but a project originally inspired by @entity2 's 1999 graduate thesis is helping to change that perception , tapping into @entity0 's potential and steering it onto a more sustainable path for the 21st century . the @entity2 is revitalizing a 35 - kilometer ( 22 - mile ) loop of abandoned railway line , transforming the land and adjacent brownfield sites into attractive new public spaces . with walking trails , cycle paths and parks dotted along the route , the project is helping connect 45 city neighborhoods . when it is completed , the @entity2 will have regenerated around 3,000 acres of land . see also : @entity35 's green city challenge construction began in 2007 , with the first trail ( the @entity38 ) opening the following year . a @entity40 trail has since opened , with another , the @entity42 , due to open this summer . along the route , residents can stop off in one of four parks , including @entity47 ( @entity0 's first energy - neutral park ) and the @entity49 , which has transformed 17 acres of wasteland into a " glistening oasis " according to developers . and thanks , in part , to a $ 25,000 donation from famed skateboarder @entity56 , the @entity2 has also created @entity0 's first public skatepark . @entity0 was losing population in the 1970s and 1980s @entity2 says , but now the urban core is growing faster than most of the suburban counties . " you 've got thousands of people moving back into the city and that creates a lot of opportunities to leverage that growth to create the kind of place that we all want to live , " he said . " if we want to live compactly , sustainably and transit oriented , the @entity2 and that growth presents the opportunity to create that kind of place , " @entity2 added . " @entity78 space is kind of the living room of the city and as more people move into the city it becomes more and more important to have spaces where people can go get out of their homes and apartments and enjoy the diversity and life of the city . " major work still needs to be completed and local voters will decide in july whether to raise taxes to pay for the work and a lengthy list of other transportation projects . all the time and money being plowed into updating @entity0 's infrastructure proves that the city is " growing up , " @entity2 says .

@entity2 rejects appeal without comment ; @placeholder publicly dissents	@entity61	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the @entity2 declined to intervene monday in a dispute over a public school 's refusal to allow an instrument - only version of " @entity8 " at a graduation ceremony . officials feared the piece would be an endorsement of religion in that limited public forum . without comment , the justices rejected the appeal of @entity18 , who was a high school senior in @entity19 , @entity0 , in 2006 . by tradition , graduating members of the school 's wind ensemble could choose a piece from their repertoire to play at the june ceremony . they chose an arrangement of @entity28 's well - known " @entity8 , " which had been performed previously in choir recitals . school district officials said they feared complaints similar to those that followed the previous year 's choir performance of a vocal piece that included references to @entity36 , heaven and angels . " @entity8 " was banned even though the performance would have contained no lyrics . the school district told principals to approve only musical selections that were " purely secular in nature . " @entity18 and others sued , saying their free speech rights were being violated , and said their choice of the piece was made on purely artistic , not religious , grounds . they also cited previous examples where a limited use of religious imagery in a public setting was considered acceptable . such examples are @entity57 monuments in city parks and opening legislative sessions with a prayer . justice @entity61 publicly dissented with the high court 's rejection of the appeal . " when a public school purports to allow students to express themselves , it must respect the students ' free speech rights , " he said . " school administrators may not behave like puppet masters who create the illusion that students are engaging in personal expression when in fact the school administration is pulling the strings . " the high court declined to explore whether those attending a graduation ceremony constituted a " captive audience " that might feel forced to hear a religious message with which they may disagree . the case is @entity18 v. @entity85 ( 09 - 671 ) . in other @entity2 action : the justices agreed to decide whether a district attorney 's office can be held liable after a former death row inmate in @entity91 said prosecutors withheld key evidence leading to his conviction . at issue is a federal law that can place the burden on the state with a " failure to train " standard when one of its prosecutors unconstitutionally withholds exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant . then - @entity108 - area district attorney @entity107 claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long - standing , accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials . the defendant , @entity115 , was freed from state prison after 18 years behind bars for the murder of a hotel executive . he came within weeks of execution before being granted a new trial . he was then acquitted in 2003 and won a $ 14 million judgment against the state . oral arguments in the appeal will be heard in the fall . the case is @entity115 ( 09 - 571 ) . in another case , current and former @entity129 detainees at the military prison in @entity131 , @entity132 , lost another round at the high court . the justices are staying out of the latest dispute about the prisoners ' demand of a 30 - day notice before any proposed transfer from the detention center . the men , known as @entity144 , wanted advance notice of which country they were being sent to , fearing they could be sent to a place where they would be tortured , imprisoned or harassed about their religious beliefs . the @entity151 government , which says the prisoners are no longer considered " enemy combatants " or a national security threat , reiterated they would not be sent to places where they might face torture or continued imprisonment . many of the @entity144 released so far have been sent to the @entity161 nation of @entity162 , with others going to @entity164 or @entity165 . the justices had previously agreed to hear the @entity144 ' broader constitutional claims over their years - long detention , but the case was tossed out as moot , since most of the men have been freed or are in the process of being freed . the case is @entity173 v. @entity174 ( 09 - 581 ) . the justices also rejected a separate appeal of a @entity178 law that keeps demonstrators away from abortion clinics . anti-abortion activists said the restriction violates their rights of free speech and assembly . the law sets a " protest - free zone " of 35 feet outside clinic entrances , including driveways . officials call it an acceptable balance between the right of access for patients and the right of expression for those opposed to the medical procedure . some protesters said they have been forced onto streets to make their beliefs known and have nearly been hit by cars . that case is @entity204 v. @entity205 ( 09 - 592 ) .	@entity28:Franz Biebl	@entity107:Harry Connick Sr.	@entity115:Connick v.

source : @placeholder commissioner @entity14 is " very much involved " in process	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 co-owner @entity1 is " moving quickly " to sell the embattled @entity4 franchise , with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week . the recent activity includes talks with several high - profile potential suitors for the team , and @entity4 commissioner @entity14 is " very much involved " in @entity1 's dealings with potential buyers , according to the source . but as bidders make their pitches for his team , @entity21 -- @entity1 's estranged husband and the team 's other owner -- accused the @entity4 of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers ' quarrel , according to a document provided by @entity21 's attorney . the document , @entity1 's 26 - page response to charges of violating the league 's bylaws , adhered to the @entity4 's tuesday deadline for the billionaire businessman 's reply . the @entity4 has said the next step will be a special @entity45 meeting on june 3 , when the league 's 30 ownership groups -- someone else will represent the @entity2 -- will meet to hear evidence on @entity21 's behavior , then vote on terminating the @entity52 ' ownership rights . @entity1 has been prejudged and wo n't get a fair hearing , the document says , citing comments from 10 other teams . about one month ago , @entity14 banned @entity1 from @entity4 facilities and functions and ordered him to pay a record fine after racist remarks by the @entity2 ' owner to former companion @entity62 surfaced online . a source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that @entity21 -- who repeatedly denied he 's a racist in a @entity0 interview -- would n't pay the fine , would reject the ban and might sue the @entity4 . the document says @entity1 faces a never - before - issued and unjust punishment . " in reality , mr. @entity1 is being banned for life , fined $ 2.5 million , and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day , " the document says . other @entity4 figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and were n't punished as harshly , @entity1 argues . his remarks were made in the heat of an argument , and while they were not justified , they were not meant to harm the @entity4 , the response says . and while @entity1 's remarks were viewed as racist , he says in his response that he was " instrumental in fostering the diverse body of players , coaches , general managers , employees and fans on which the @entity4 prides itself . " the document also says @entity1 was active in the @entity98 - @entity97 community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the @entity2 in more than 30 years . @entity1 asks that the @entity4 's charges be denied and that his ownership rights not be terminated . the @entity4 acknowledged receiving a response from @entity1 and reaffirmed the june 3 meeting , saying it will start at 1 p.m. et to " hear and vote upon this matter . " @entity21 's attorney , @entity107 , had no comment . @entity62 has said @entity1 knew she was recording him and that the two were never intimate . @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity110 said it appeared the @entity52 were taking a two - track strategy . by filing the document , @entity21 is protecting his legal options but , at the same time , he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome . " i do n't think it 's a winning argument , but it is a very impressive document , " @entity110 said . possible bidders @entity0 's source on the potential sale said it was a busy @entity122 weekend for @entity1 . the source indicated she met sunday with a group led by former @entity4 star @entity125 to discuss the sale of the @entity2 . in addition , the source familiar with the situation said she met over the weekend at her @entity130 , @entity131 , home with ex-microsoft ceo @entity132 , who made an aggressive offer for the franchise . @entity1 is interested in fielding offers from billionaire businessman @entity136 , @entity125 's group , entertainment mogul @entity138 and @entity140 founder @entity139 , and entrepreneur @entity141 and his @entity143 partners , who two years ago teamed up to buy baseball 's @entity145 . @entity141 has been at the center of the story from the outset because of controversial banter between 80 - year - old @entity21 and @entity62 . after @entity151 first reported those comments , @entity21 lashed out at @entity141 in a @entity0 interview , questioning whether someone who contracted @entity155 should be considered a role model and asking rhetorically " what has he done " for the @entity98 - @entity97 community . @entity141 called the whole situation sad in his own interview with @entity0 , in which he urged @entity21 to sell the team . the former @entity163 said if that happens -- and if his @entity143 partners are interested -- " we 'll make a run for it . " one person who apparently wo n't be the @entity4 franchise 's next owner is media tycoon @entity171 . despite much buzz in recent weeks , the source familiar with the situation says that @entity171 is " out of the running . " the same source said @entity1 will accept offers this week for the @entity2 . @entity1 's attorney , @entity177 , said no formal offers have been made for the team , which has risen in recent years from a last - place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward @entity183 and guard @entity184 . " @entity1 and the @entity4 are working cooperatively on the transaction , " @entity177 said . the @entity52 have been publicly defiant since the story broke , challenging the @entity4 and its right to force the @entity2 ' sale . but late last week , the @entity52 agreed that @entity1 would try to sell the @entity4 franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights . the couple own the team through a trust . @entity1 previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise , but does n't want to be a controlling partner . but if it sold -- likely for between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2 billion , according to the well - placed source -- the @entity4 does n't want either @entity52 to have any ownership stake . still , they could take solace in the dizzying profit they 'd make from such a deal ; @entity21 reportedly bought the franchise in 1981 for about $ 12 million . his response , though , laments that a forced sale would mean the @entity52 would incur " several hundred million dollars " in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs . @entity1 's wife , @entity1 : we 're just business partners @entity0 's @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .	@entity21:Donald Sterling	@entity107:Maxwell Blecher	@entity139:Larry Ellison	@entity138:David Geffen	@entity110:Toobin	@entity151:TMZ	@entity136:Patrick Soon-Shiong	@entity131:California	@entity130:Malibu	@entity155:HIV	@entity132:Steve Ballmer	@entity171:Winfrey	@entity2:Clippers	@entity1:Shelly Sterling	@entity0:CNN	@entity177:O'Donnell	@entity4:NBA	@entity218:Jill Martin	@entity219:Michael Martinez	@entity52:Sterlings	@entity14:Adam Silver	@entity145:Los Angeles Dodgers	@entity217:Rosalina Nieves	@entity98:African	@entity97:American	@entity125:Grant Hill	@entity122:Memorial Day	@entity163:Los Angeles Laker	@entity140:Oracle	@entity141:Johnson	@entity143:Guggenheim	@entity183:Blake Griffin	@entity184:Chris Paul	@entity45:Board of Governors	@entity62:Stiviano
tips roll in after @placeholder ' documentary " @entity5 " airs , but none deemed viable	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- it does n't appear tracking down this piece of 9/11 history will be easy . tips have been rolling in , spurred by the @entity6 ' production , " @entity5 , " a documentary about the flag that three @entity10 firefighters hoisted above the @entity12 rubble in the aftermath of the attack . this particular version of @entity16 was 3 feet by 5 feet . photos and video from the site suggest it went missing fewer than six hours after a photographer with a @entity23 , @entity24 , newspaper captured the firefighters ' deed in a photo that would become one of the most -- if not the most -- iconic images from tragedy . co-director @entity31 said he expects that as news of the film infiltrates the tight - knit communities of @entity10 's firefighters , police officers , port authority workers and paramedics , more viable leads will come . " once more people from that world see it , i think we 're going to start learning a lot more , " he said , adding that he and co-director @entity40 examined more than 5,000 photos and viewed four days of television coverage from each of the networks during the documentary 's production . viewers began sharing leads before the documentary aired wednesday , as tv featured promos and @entity0 posted a preview . by wednesday night , there were a collective 50 tips to @entity0 's landing page , an e-mail tip line and @entity61 . only a dozen or so were credible . of course , there was the obligatory yahoo claiming aliens took it -- but there were more sober sightings as well . a @entity69 woman said she saw it in the @entity71 in @entity72 , while another viewer wondered whether a flag he 'd seen at the @entity75 in @entity76 was the banner in question . other potential sightings came at @entity81 's @entity80 ; @entity83 's @entity82 in @entity84 ; the @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 ; and the hair and makeup department of the @entity10 @entity90 in @entity91 . in one seemingly angry e-mail received before the documentary aired , a man using the name of a retired @entity10 police lieutenant slammed the firefighters . he accused them of stealing the flag ( the documentary explains how it was taken from a yacht docked near the trade center ) and claimed the iconic photo was staged and that the firefighters absconded with the flag after the picture was taken . " there had already been a few flags hoisted down at the site including the first flag to be hoisted by 2 officers from the @entity113 , " the tipster wrote . " since the @entity113 raised their flag in the immediate aftermath of the attack , there is still a ton of smoke and soot in the air , there are numerous rescue workers on scene ... several of whom are saluting . this is a much more original , natural , unrehearsed shot than the photo op taken much later . " the most credible tip , @entity31 said , came from a man who said a lighting company in @entity131 , @entity132 , that assisted with the 9/11 cleanup effort was in possession of the flag . but that flag turned out to be larger than the 9/11 flag , @entity31 said . @entity31 's hunch is that the flag 's disappearance involved nothing nefarious . " someone most likely saw it there and thought that 's a dirty , tattered flag and said , ' i 'm going to save that , ' " he said . " it 's going to be someone who either went there to volunteer with some specific skill or was a first responder . " if anything , i think someone 's intentions were very good . " while some tips are more feasible than others , @entity31 says , " they 're all legitimate because people have connections to these objects , to these symbols . " and perhaps more important than finding the flag is providing this outlet for catharsis , @entity31 said . many people have forgotten how they felt the day the towers came down . with a war - weary nation now considering military action in @entity170 , @entity31 believes discussing and searching for the 9/11 flag gives people an opportunity to revisit their emotions and " immerse themselves in the story of that day . " " it was the worst of days that somehow brought out the best in many @entity180 , " he said . " it 's more than looking for a flag . it 's about looking for that feeling .

new : @placeholder rocket launch , nuke test , mobile missile and threats prompt action	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity2 will deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity5 as part of efforts to enhance the nation 's ability to defend itself from attack by @entity11 , defense secretary @entity1 announced friday . still relatively new in his post , the @entity13 chief told reporters that 14 additional interceptors to be installed by 2017 would bring the total to 44 . it is part of a package of steps expected to cost $ 1 billion , officials said . " the reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances , is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency , " @entity22 said . @entity11 says it 's the victim of ' intensive ' cyberattacks friday 's move came after @entity11 recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on @entity37 and the @entity2 in response to stepped - up @entity40 sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month . in december , @entity11 successfully launched a long - range rocket for the first time under what the @entity2 and other @entity45 nations say was the guise of putting a satellite into orbit . moreover , @entity13 officials said they became concerned about a mobile missile spotted in a parade last april . the @entity54 missile can be moved around the country and hidden , making it harder to detect compared to a missile on a launch pad . " we believe the @entity54 does have the range to reach the @entity2 , " said adm. @entity59 . @entity11 also said last week it was nullifying the joint declaration on the de-nuclearization of the @entity64 . one of the country 's top generals , according to published reports , claims @entity68 has nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired . while @entity22 said the steps he announced were aimed at addressing the threat from @entity11 and @entity74 , the focus was clearly on the potential for @entity11 to some day follow through on its belligerent rhetoric . @entity74 also is believed to be continuing its efforts to develop nuclear weapon capability . @entity80 and @entity81 officials have said current @entity2 missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat , and president @entity85 said in an interview with @entity87 this week that he does not think @entity11 can carry out a missile attack on the @entity2 . " they probably ca n't but we do n't like the margin of error , " @entity85 said . @entity22 said friday that @entity2 missile defense systems in place provide protection from " limited icbm attacks , " but added that " @entity11 , in particular , has recently made advances in its capabilities and has engaged in a series of irresponsible and reckless provocations . " however , @entity100 of the @entity101 told @entity0 the planned expansion would only spend more money on a system that does n't work to protect against a still unrealized @entity11 threat . the existing missile defense system was " deeply flawed , " said @entity100 , whose foundation opposes nuclear weapons . he added that @entity11 was " years away from the ability to field a missile with a nuclear warhead that could hit the @entity2 . " @entity22 acknowledged a problem with the guidance system of missile interceptors and said further testing would occur this year . " we certainly will not go forward with the additional 14 interceptors until we are sure that we have the complete confidence that we will need , " @entity22 said . " but the @entity2 people should be assured that our interceptors are effective . " he also announced the military will work with @entity123 to increase radar capability to improve early warning and tracking of any missile launched from @entity11 . @entity11 ready to ' rain bullets on the enemy ' asked how @entity132 would react to @entity22 's announcement , @entity131 @entity130 said : " i hope that they understand that we need to take steps to protect ourselves from potential threats from @entity74 and @entity11 . " part of the move announced by @entity22 would involve reopening a missile field at @entity141 , @entity142 . in 2011 , the @entity13 mothballed @entity143 1 , acting on direction from the @entity85 administration . instead of permanently decommissioning it , the @entity146 placed it in a non-operational state . @entity13 officials testified at a budget hearing at the time that hardening and reactivating the six silos in @entity154 would take two years and cost approximately $ 200 million . @entity13 officials testified then that " there are no current threats dictating the need , nor plans to reactivate @entity158 - 1 in the future . " @entity161 congressional sources told @entity0 that they argued against the move . " @entity11 was doing all sorts of things we could n't talk about publicly back then , " said one @entity161 congressional official who is privy to intelligence briefings . " the intelligence did not change . this is right where we expected @entity11 to be . it takes about two years to order and take delivery of a new interceptor . that 's why you have to be ahead of the threat . " in his @entity178 last month , @entity85 said the @entity2 would " stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats . " last week , @entity130 told the @entity185 that " @entity11 's shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the @entity2 to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future @entity11 " intercontinental ballistic missile . a look at @entity11 's escalating rhetoric @entity0 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .	@entity22:Hagel	@entity80:Military	@entity81:White House	@entity158:MF	@entity85:Obama	@entity87:ABC News	@entity131:Undersecretary of Defense for Policy	@entity130:Miller	@entity132:China	@entity2:U.S.	@entity1:Chuck Hagel	@entity0:CNN	@entity11:N.

@entity2 's fame is partly based on a @placeholder awards scandal in 1982	@entity91	( @entity0 ) -- singer - actress @entity2 landed in jail after she allegedly fought with her teenage son when he would n't go to bed early saturday , police said . @entity2 , 61 , was charged with domestic violence battery and coercion for allegedly scratching 16 - year - old @entity9 's ear as she tried to take his cell phone when he dialed 911 , according to a @entity13 @entity12 report . @entity14 told police his mother and her husband -- @entity13 @entity18 . @entity19 -- were drinking alcohol in their home before the incident . the trouble began around 11 p.m. when his mother said she was tired and she ordered him to bed , the police report said . " @entity9 said he told his mom he wanted to stay outside and talk because it was a weekend night , " the report said . @entity2 became " upset and angry " and " got the hose and started squirting everyone , insisting that @entity9 go to bed and @entity35 leave . " she then scratched her husband 's face and was " punching and scratching " her 32 - year - old stepson , the report said . several hours later -- at 4:30 a.m. -- the mother and son " wrestled " over @entity9 's cell phone , it said . " @entity2 then grabbed him from behind around his head , grabbing his eyes and face , leaving a scratch on his left ear , " the report said . " @entity9 got away and @entity2 came up and again grabbed him from behind encircling his neck in the process . " when police arrived , they were not allowed inside the home , but they realized a police officer -- @entity19 -- lived there , the report said . two officers found an unlocked door in the rear and entered , the report said . " @entity60 . come out with your hand up , " an officer announced . " what are you doing in my house ? " an unknown male voice replied . " i then stated that he knew why we were there and to come out so we could talk , " the reporting officer wrote . " why do n't you f -- king come back here and get me ! " the unknown male shouted , the report said . the police officers retreated from inside the home and waited for @entity78 officers to surround the house , the report said . @entity2 later told police she did not come out because she thought her husband , a detective " would take care of it . " after a couple of hours of sleep -- with the @entity78 officers still surrounding her house -- she said she called 911 and operators told her to go outside , which she did . @entity2 's fame is partially based on her involvement in a @entity91 awards scandal in 1982 . when the @entity93 gave her the @entity95 best female newcomer award , it triggered allegations that her wealthy then - husband had influenced the selection by entertaining voters at his casino . @entity0 's @entity101 contributed to this report .	@entity2:Zadora	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Las Vegas	@entity12:Metropolitan Police	@entity9:Jordan	@entity19:Jeffries	@entity18:Police Det	@entity101:Greg Morrison	@entity14:Jordon	@entity78:SWAT	@entity35:Mike Jr.	@entity95:Golden Globe	@entity93:Hollywood Foreign Press Association	@entity60:Metro Police	@entity91:Hollywood
@placeholder thrashes @entity162 3 - 0 at @entity221	@entity158	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 means business . a fortnight ago the critics were wondering if the @entity4 could last the pace -- now that doubt looks to have been quashed -- and in some style . a 1 - 0 win over last year 's @entity9 finalist @entity10 proved @entity1 can mix it with @entity13 's elite when it really matters . having lost the home fixture against the @entity17 side in north @entity18 two weeks ago , victory was essential for @entity1 to keep hold of its own destiny . and it duly obliged thanks to @entity23 's second half winner -- his 11th goal in 16 games -- not bad for a player who had only mustered five in 91 apperances for the club over the past two years . " i was impressed mostly by our focus because we were under consistent pressure from the first to the last minute , " @entity1 manager @entity29 told @entity30 . " nevertheless , we created chances and we could have scored a second . " a year ago , i thought it would be difficult for @entity23 to score goals but he 's developed tremendously and that 's a huge credit to him . " @entity23 has enjoyed a stunning season -- taking the @entity41 by storm . the @entity44 international has been a revelation at the heart of the @entity1 midfield and his latest strike secured one of the club 's most impressive @entity51 victories of modern times . @entity1 arrived in @entity17 to face a @entity10 side which had made its most successful start to a league season since 2010/11 . having won all eight of its home games this season , including the victory in the @entity61 , @entity10 roared out the traps at their traditional breakneck speed . but despite dominating possession , the @entity17 side failed to find the breakthrough . @entity68 international @entity67 should have done better in the first half after being played through on goal but his effort sailed wide of the post . @entity10 pushed forward again after the interval but it was @entity1 which struck the killer blow with 62 minutes on the clock . @entity77 swung the ball into the penalty area and after @entity80 had managed to flick the ball on , @entity23 stole in to nod home from close range . @entity10 huffed and puffed as they searched for an equalizer but only a superb save by @entity86 denied @entity23 a second as @entity1 broke at speed . per @entity88 sent a header just over the crossbar as the visiting side looked to double its advantage . and although @entity10 pushed forward late on , it was unable to find the equalizer it so badly craved . " we dominated , we worked , we had good runs and we did a lot of things right . we played good football and it was not boring , " said @entity10 manager @entity99 . " but we lacked the finish . we should have done more from our possession . " @entity10 now faces a fierce fight to qualify for the next stage after @entity106 recorded a 3 - 2 win over @entity108 . the @entity110 side sits second , three points clear of @entity10 , with the two teams scheduled to meet in @entity17 on november 26 . @entity113 scored twice and @entity114 was also on target for @entity106 , which is level on nine points with @entity1 . elsewhere , @entity117 ended his goal drought with a double in @entity121 's 3 - 1 win over @entity122 . the victory books @entity121 's place in the last 16 with two games to spare . @entity117 fired home the opener from the penalty spot before @entity129 headed a second . @entity122 , which sits second in the group , did pull a goal back when @entity121 defender @entity133 inadvertently diverted @entity135 's cross into his own net . but @entity117 sealed the win seven minutes from time with a classy finish to ensure @entity121 's place in the knockout phase for the 10th year in a row . @entity143 is still in the mix in @entity145 following a 1 - 0 win over @entity149 champion @entity147 in @entity150 . @entity151 scored the only goal of the game for the @entity155 side , which has taken four points from four games -- one fewer than @entity122 . @entity158 looks in good shape to qualify from @entity160 following a 3 - 0 win over @entity17 side @entity162 . @entity163 scored twice and @entity164 was also on target as @entity158 bounced back from its weekend defeat in the @entity41 at @entity167 .

@placeholder : for the @entity9 , firing a gun must remain the rarest of rare events	@entity127	( @entity0 ) -- shortly after 9 a.m. on friday , a man identified as @entity2 shot a former co-worker outside the @entity4 with a .45 - caliber weapon . a courageous civilian saw what happened and alerted two @entity9 officers . after the police caught up with @entity2 , he pulled his weapon out of a bag and pointed it at the officers who had been performing counterterrorism duties . the officers fired 16 shots , killing @entity2 . in the exchange of fire , nine bystanders were injured . as a rule , it takes a lot to get @entity9 officers to fire their guns at anyone . despite a handful of isolated , but highly publicized , exceptions to this rule when officers have shot unarmed individuals over the past decade and a half , @entity27 's 35,000 - officer force remains a worldwide model of firearms restraint and veneration for human life . the nation 's largest police department instills in its officers that the decision to fire a weapon is momentous and should only be considered after every reasonable alternative has been exhausted . only when officers feel that a suspect is a clear and imminent danger to them or others can they resort to using their firearms . then , they must take care to not needlessly endanger innocent people who might be in the way . in rapidly unfolding and completely unpredictable situations , assessing the need to use firearms is often a split - second decision . it can mean the difference between life and death . officers have to sift through confusion , fear and fragmented information . in the incident outside of the @entity4 , it is made more difficult because the street is one of the busiest in @entity69 . the officers had to take into account the risk of the gunman hurting potentially many people in the vicinity were he not stopped . when @entity27 officers do use firearm , it is a matter of great importance to the department . shootings are vigorously reviewed . officers are questioned thoroughly and can be ordered to undergo additional training . they can be disciplined and even terminated . the police department pores over each shooting and tries to glean insights that can help better train cops . the message is clear : firing a gun must remain the rarest of rare events . for prosecutors and police executives reviewing events when all the facts are known afterward , it is a different story . officers can be criticized for too much action or for too much restraint when things do n't go well . fortunately , in the incident today , the bystanders who were shot were not seriously hurt . street officers are always interested in better ways to handle unpredictable situations , and police departments everywhere can not provide enough quality hands on training for front line cops . excellent training in firearms restraint is a vital tool that has helped drive down @entity9 shootings over time . in 1972 , @entity27 's finest were involved in almost 1,000 incidents in which firearms were discharged ; in 2010 , that number was just 92 . good thing , too , because no matter the training or innate restraint of the police , there really is no safe way to deal with shootings in a crowded city . ultimately , the outcome is always uncertain . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .	@entity2:Johnson	@entity0:CNN	@entity27:New York	@entity4:Empire State Building	@entity9:NYPD	@entity69:America	@entity127:O'Donnell
@placeholder returns to court on february 28 when judge will again consider jail for him	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 will stay in rehab a few more weeks despite a prosecutor 's request he be thrown in jail . @entity2 , who has been on probation since pleading guilty to assaulting girlfriend @entity11 five years ago , is becoming more violent , with his outbursts " increasing in severity and intensity , " @entity9 deputy district attorney @entity7 argued monday . the singer has been in a rehab program for anger issues and drug abuse since november when the judge ordered him to go there instead of jail for an earlier probation violation . but the prosecutor asked monday that he been locked up in jail because of his arrest in @entity24 on an assault charge . although @entity27 judge @entity26 ruled @entity2 was again in violation of probation , he cited a new report from his probation officer that concluded @entity2 " is doing well in the program and making great strides " in rehab . for now , @entity2 can stay in rehab , the judge ruled . " it appears your doing well in the program , " he told @entity37 . " there 's no reason to put him into custody at this point , " @entity2 attorney @entity41 said after the hearing . " we 're happy that the judge agreed with us . " @entity2 is expected to complete the rehab program on february 19 , but he has to travel to @entity24 for a hearing on the assault charge on february 20 . that case could still send @entity2 to jail in @entity0 if he is found guilty . the probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on @entity11 requires that he stay out of legal trouble . the judge will hold another hearing on february 28 to decide his fate after rehab . the latest probation report praises @entity2 's new improved attitude in complying with probation rules . " he appears to have a more serious and responsible demeanor and is responding well to dual diagnosis treatment program and changes in medication , " his probation officer wrote . @entity2 is working on a community labor crew three days a week until he completes 1,000 of work ordered by the judge in november . he 's finished 109 hours and still has 809 hours left before his probation can be completed , the probation officer said . at that pace , @entity2 has another 101 days of work left . the glowing report is a stark contrast to what the probation officer wrote in november after @entity2 was booted from another rehab facility after smashing his mother 's car window during a family session . " there is much concern with the probationer 's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility , " that probation report said . @entity2 and his bodyguard , @entity93 , face assault charges stemming an incident outside the a hotel near the @entity97 in october . the federal prosecutor handling the case offered to let them each plead guilty to one count of simple assault , but they rejected the offers at court last month . @entity2 rejects plea deal in @entity24 court	@entity2:Brown	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Los Angeles	@entity7:Mary Murray	@entity24:D.C.	@entity11:Rihanna	@entity9:Los Angeles County	@entity37:Brown	@entity41:Mark Geragos	@entity97:White House	@entity26:James Brandlin	@entity93:Christopher Hollosy	@entity27:Los Angeles County Superior Court
the companies were dealt an injunction on sales due to @placeholder 's patent claims .	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- last week , a @entity2 district judge dealt a serious blow to @entity4 and @entity5 by slapping an injunction on the @entity8 phone and the @entity9 in a patent infringement lawsuit . although judge @entity11 has n't found @entity5 guilty of patent infringement -- not yet , anyway -- she ruled that @entity13 would suffer irreparable harm if the two @entity16 devices were found to infringe @entity13 patents and remained on sale during the trial . time.com : per @entity13 request , judge orders @entity5 to halg @entity24 tablet sales the @entity8 is @entity4 's lead @entity16 device , so @entity26 's ruling is the biggest patent setback for @entity16 to date . ( @entity5 has appealed @entity26 's ruling . ) i 'm not a lawyer or a shareholder in any of the companies involved , so i 'm less concerned with the legal maneuvering than i am with the patent wars ' effects on consumers . let 's take a look at what the injunctions and the greater mobile patent wars mean for the people who are actually using the products : are existing users affected ? if you own a @entity8 or @entity9 , no one 's going to show up at your doorstep and ask for it back . your device will continue to work , but there 's always a chance that @entity4 or @entity5 may tweak their software in future updates to work around claims of patent infringement . my @entity56 , for instance , lost its " overscroll bounce " effect in an update late last year , and i suspect this was done to avoid a patent claim that @entity13 has wielded against other companies . time.com : going @entity16 : an experiment the patents at issue in the @entity5 case deal with universal search , predictive text , slide - to - unlock and the ability to select an action when you tap on certain types of text . it 's not yet clear whether @entity4 and @entity5 can come up with workarounds . can you still buy a @entity8 or @entity9 ? i ca n't find the original @entity9 online , aside from a few refurbished units , but the device is now a year old and not worth buying . i 'm guessing most retailers had already stopped selling it . instead , you can get the tab 2 10.1 , which remains on sale at @entity86 and elsewhere . the unlocked @entity8 remains on sale on @entity4 's website , but we 'll see what happens once @entity13 posts a $ 96 million bond that 's required to set the ban in motion . ( if @entity5 prevails at trial , it will get that bond money to make up for lost sales . ) a @entity98 store clerk , meanwhile , told @entity100 's @entity99 that the carrier will sell its remaining @entity8 stock , but ca n't import any more units . time.com : @entity106 court orders @entity13 to pay $ 60 million to settle @entity108 name dispute are all @entity16 devices now doomed ? aside from @entity5 , @entity13 has also sued @entity110 and @entity111 for patent infringement . the @entity113 found @entity111 guilty of infringing two patents , and its latest phones were briefly held up at customs in may while the company 's workarounds were approved . @entity13 claims that the workaround is n't good enough , so @entity111 's not out of the woods yet , but at the moment @entity111 's @entity16 phones are widely available . @entity110 also seems safe for the moment , following @entity126 judge @entity125 's decision to dismiss the entire case of @entity13 v. @entity110 . @entity125 said neither side could prove damages , and @entity13 could n't show that an injunction would benefit itself more than it would hurt @entity110 . @entity13 will most likely appeal the ruling . are @entity13 products at risk ? of course , @entity13 's rivals have filed counter-suits . the problem for @entity5 and @entity110 is that they 're relying on " standard - essential " patents that are required for telecommunications , and must be licensed on fair , reasonable and non-discriminatory terms . the @entity140 is currently investigating @entity110 , which is suing both @entity13 and @entity141 , over its use of these standard - essential patents to score injunctions . if the @entity140 requires @entity110 to license its patents , the company will lose its ability to get @entity13 products banned . this article originally appeared on @entity0 : @entity13 wins ban on two @entity16 devices : what it means for you	@entity26:Koh	@entity111:HTC	@entity24:Galaxy	@entity126:U.S. Court of Appeals	@entity113:U.S. International Trade Commission	@entity86:Best Buy	@entity110:Motorola	@entity2:U.S.	@entity0:Time.com	@entity5:Samsung	@entity4:Google	@entity9:Galaxy Tab 10.1	@entity8:Galaxy Nexus	@entity56:Galaxy S II	@entity16:Android	@entity13:Apple	@entity11:Lucy Koh	@entity100:Mashable	@entity106:China	@entity98:Verizon	@entity108:iPad	@entity125:Posner	@entity140:FTC	@entity141:Microsoft	@entity99:Lance Ulanoff
@entity31 scores twice as @placeholder move to within seven points of @entity8	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 grabbed a hat - trick as @entity3 crushed @entity4 7 - 0 to close the gap on @entity7 league leaders @entity8 . the @entity10 striker ended his four - match goal drought in style as @entity14 's side reduced @entity8 's advantage at the top of @entity17 to seven points . second - bottom @entity4 had no answer to a powerful attacking display and finished the game with nine men after defender @entity24 was sent off and @entity25 limped off injured after they had made all their permitted substitutions . @entity4 coach @entity27 , who was replaced at @entity3 by @entity14 , chose to rest some of his best players and the decision came back to haunt him at the @entity30 . @entity32 international @entity31 began the rout after 27 minutes when he diverted @entity35 's free kick into the net . @entity37 added a second nine minutes later after capitalizing on a missed interception to slot the ball into the bottom corner . just before the break @entity41 slammed @entity37 's pass into the corner of the net to make it 3 - 0 . there was no let up after the interval as @entity1 rounded off a flowing move to register a fourth before @entity31 got his second with a header from @entity41 's cross . @entity24 handled in the area to give @entity3 a penalty and was shown a second yellow card by the referee . @entity1 made no mistake from the spot . and the striker completed his hat - trick by converting @entity62 ' cross at the near post with 13 minutes remaining before asking to be substituted .	@entity3:Real	@entity17:La Liga	@entity1:Cristiano Ronaldo	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Spain	@entity27:Manuel Pelligrini	@entity24:Manolo	@entity4:Malaga	@entity8:Barca	@entity37:Di Maria	@entity10:Portuguese	@entity14:Mourinho	@entity41:Marcelo	@entity32:France	@entity35:Xabi Alonso	@entity30:Bernabeu	@entity25:Cala	@entity62:Sergio Canales	@entity31:Karim Benzema
legislators question interim deal on @placeholder nukes	@entity1	he does n't trust @entity1 , vows it wo n't get nuclear weapons , and believes past rhetoric by its leaders threatening annihilation of @entity7 is unacceptable and kind of insane . so why is secretary of state @entity8 so adamant about getting time to try to negotiate an agreement that would further curb @entity1 's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions ? the former @entity13 spent 2 1/2 hours at a @entity14 hearing on tuesday defending the international negotiations last month that brought an interim deal with @entity1 intended to lead to a comprehensive agreement after six months . facing skeptical legislators from both parties , @entity8 tried to assure them that he shares their mistrust of @entity1 while asking that they halt the drive for new sanctions for now to give negotiations , which also involve the other permanent members of the @entity26 and @entity27 , a chance to succeed . he bristled when yet another @entity30 legislator , rep. @entity29 of @entity31 , described the @entity33 position as giving @entity1 the benefit of the doubt by not requiring the dismantling of all centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons . " i sat here and said we 're skeptical . i sat here and said they 've got to prove it , " @entity8 responded , adding " there 's no benefit of any doubt here . " his takeaway message borrowed from former president @entity50 's " trust but verify " guideline for a weapons deal with the @entity53 , but @entity8 modified it to reflect the lack of trust in @entity58 's intentions . " @entity67 and verify , " he said repeatedly in describing restrictions on @entity1 's program in the interim agreement , as well as the necessary monitoring and testing for a final agreement acceptable to president @entity65 that would ensure @entity1 would be unable to develop nukes . a bipartisan group of @entity13 is working on new sanctions legislation and the @entity14 may consider a similar measure , prompted by concern that the interim agreement eased some sanctions without achieving the goal of ridding @entity1 of its centrifuges and other technology needed to build a nuclear bomb . however , the interim deal reached last month in @entity79 prohibits new sanctions , and @entity8 argued tuesday that such a step was unnecessary at this point . " they know that if they fail , sanctions will be increased , " @entity8 said of @entity1 . " we 've said it a hundred times and you all have said it a hundred times and they know you 're yearning to go do it but you do n't need to do it . it is actually gratuitous in the context of this situation because you can do it in a week if you need to when we say , ' this ai n't working , we need your help , ' and believe me we 'll be prepared to do that . " on @entity103 visit , @entity8 sees hope of progress for @entity1 , @entity7 after @entity8 's remarks tuesday , the chairman of the @entity107 said the panel would hold off on considering new sanctions legislation for now . the statement by @entity113 sen. @entity112 of @entity114 left open the possibility of @entity107 leaders taking up the bill without having it go through the committee . earlier , @entity8 declared that " @entity1 will not acquire a nuclear weapon , " calling the stance the centerpiece of president @entity65 's foreign policy . the interim agreement eases some $ 7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of @entity1 's nuclear program , @entity8 told the committee . @entity7 opposes that deal because it allows @entity1 -- a longtime enemy of the jewish state -- to continue enriching uranium needed to develop nuclear weapons . prime minister @entity135 has made clear that @entity7 would attack @entity1 's nuclear facilities if it felt threatened , and the negotiations are considered an effort to avoid a possible military confrontation in the volatile @entity103 . in @entity142 , legislators from both parties agree that tougher measures are needed . " we are facing an immoral and very dangerous regime in @entity1 , one nearing a nuclear weapon , " rep. @entity144 , the @entity14 's @entity30 chairman , said at tuesday 's hearing . " i am hard pressed to understand why we 'd be letting up sanctions pressure at the very time its economy is on the ropes without getting an agreement which stops its centrifuges from spinning . " others used more graphic language , with @entity30 rep. @entity156 of @entity157 comparing @entity1 's threats against @entity7 to @entity27 . " what can you say to @entity7 and the rest of our allies in the @entity103 to convince them that @entity33 is still a reliable ally , that @entity33 will enforce agreements with @entity1 or else , and that @entity33 is not ignoring history and repeating the 1930s @entity169 - like pattern of appeasement and retreat that helped trigger @entity172 and the death of tens of millions of people around the world ? " @entity156 asked . @entity8 responded by " condemning in the strongest language possible those expressions of hate and of , you know , sheer and utter insanity , almost , asking for a country to be wiped off the face of the map . " " that language is the most abhorrent kind of language you can find in any discourse of public life , " he said . " it has no place in a reasonable world . it 's unacceptable , and we should never hear that kind of language again . " @entity1 officials have long said the country 's nuclear intentions were peaceful . they also warned any new sanctions would scuttle the interim agreement , noting that language in the document specifies no new ones can occur . @entity65 said over the weekend that he would accept a peaceful nuclear program in @entity1 , including modest uranium enrichment . however , @entity144 said the key issue is whether an eventual final agreement negotiated on the world stage with @entity1 would permit it to " manufacture nuclear fuel . " " unfortunately , the interim agreement raises some questions about this , " he said . " my concern is that we may have bargained away our fundamental position , which is enshrined in six @entity218 -- and that fundamental agreement is that @entity1 should not be enriching and reprocessing . we may bargain that away for a false confidence that we can effectively check @entity1 's " misuse of the nuclear weapons technologies . @entity30 rep. @entity225 of @entity226 said the @entity1 " can get all the nuclear material they need for power by purchasing it from other countries , " adding that " they do n't need to enrich it themselves . " @entity8 stopped short of declaring a final agreement with @entity1 would prevent any uranium enrichment capability for @entity58 , saying such details must be worked out . he noted that the interim agreement reached last month requires full consensus on such matters . to legislators calling for more sanctions , @entity8 said economic strictures alone had failed to prevent @entity1 from expanding its centrifuges in recent years as it made progress toward developing a nuclear weapon . " the issue here is what are we going to do about it so we do n't have a sudden breakout , " he said , adding that the interim agreement is a step toward that . " in order to weaponize , you have to have highly enriched uranium . under the agreement , they ca n't have highly enriched uranium . " @entity144 , though , noted that @entity1 has " a history of deceiving the international community about its nuclear program , and is pursuing a ballistic missile program in violation of @entity218 , " adding that it " simply ca n't be trusted with enrichment technology , because verification efforts can never be foolproof .

religious cleric @entity0 to lead mass march to @placeholder	@entity1	@entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- " terrorism and violence can not be permissible in @entity8 , " @entity0 told @entity2 's @entity3 in 2010 after declaring a fatwa on terrorism . the bold pronouncement thrust @entity0 into headlines worldwide and led to an invitation to speak at the prestigious @entity13 and @entity12 . two years on , the religious cleric has resurfaced in @entity15 , demanding free and fair elections , after spending the last six years living in @entity17 . @entity0 has come a long way since his time as a parliamentarian during general @entity22 's regime in the early 2000s . after promoting his agenda from abroad -- speaking out in videos and books -- he is now back in the political spotlight in his home country , calling for a caretaker administration to take the government 's place and carry out election reforms ahead of an upcoming vote . according to @entity0 , the composition of the caretaker government should be decided with the input of the judiciary and the military . but in a country with a history of military coups , @entity0 's mention of the army in the electoral process set off alarm bells with the current government and opposition who quickly reassured the @entity15 people that nothing would stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process . some @entity15 have suggested @entity53 is working on behalf of the military -- an allegation he denies . he maintains that he is working only to ensure a corruption - free electoral process . @entity0 threatened that unless his election reform demands were met by thursday , he would stage a " @entity61 " to the capital , paralyzing the city with thousands of supporters . " we will not succumb to these illegal demands , " senator @entity64 , @entity15 's interior minister told media thursday , in anticipation of the protest , which is expected to arrive in @entity1 on monday . @entity64 said he would not allow the rally to enter downtown @entity1 as it posed a security risk and would disrupt business operations in the city ; he said the @entity15 government had cordoned off sensitive areas of @entity1 . " the residents of @entity1 are scared that mobs will raid their houses and there will be violence and murder , " @entity64 said . " i will hold @entity0 personally responsible if there is any violence or murders during this rally . " @entity64 announced last week that he had intercepted intelligence that the @entity15 @entity86 was planning to attack the gathering on monday . despite criticism from the government , @entity0 seems intent on marching to the capital , spending millions on prime time television advertising to urge others to join him .

" we plan on removing the barricades put up by the government and we will remain in the city whether it is [ for ] two days or 30 days , until our demands are met , " @entity93 said . however , just two days before the planned march on @entity1 , the only political party supporting @entity0 's march , the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , a coalition partner in the current government , pulled its support . supporters maintain that @entity0 is only trying to make a positive change in a country that is in need of help . they point to his welfare organization , called @entity115 , which promotes " true @entity8 teachings . " according to its website , it has up to 280,000 members worldwide and works to build madrassahs around the country to teach young children the @entity121 . the " @entity61 , " which is expected to reach @entity1 on monday , could be a game changer , analysts say , because it could have a major impact on the democratic process -- but whether the outcome of that would be positive or negative at this crucial time for @entity15 politics is still unclear .	@entity3:Christiane Amanpour	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Islamabad	@entity0:Qadri	@entity13:World Economic Forum	@entity12:United States Institute for Peace	@entity8:Islamic	@entity15:Pakistan	@entity22:Pervez Musharraf	@entity53:Qadri	@entity102:Mutahida Qaumi Movement	@entity103:MQM	@entity86:Taliban	@entity17:Canada	@entity64:Malik	@entity61:Million Man March	@entity93:Mursaleen	@entity115:Minhaj ul Quran	@entity121:Quran
double gold for @placeholder and @entity140	@entity164	( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 teenager @entity1 survived two falls to emerge on top of a tense and error - ridden finale to the men 's figure skating competition at the @entity8 in @entity9 friday . the 19 - year - old had set a world - record score in the short program , but under pressure of expectation in the concluding free routine appeared to have blown his chances as he failed to land two jumps . however , there was drama still to come on day seven of the @entity20 as three - time world champion @entity21 of @entity22 once again saw his dreams of @entity25 gold crumble . a lackluster display littered with mistakes saw @entity21 fail to overhaul @entity28 , who was left as a relieved winner -- @entity3 's first in the event as the country opened its gold - medal account in @entity9 . he is the youngest winner of the figure skating competition at a @entity8 for 66 years . " i 'm so proud of this feat as a @entity3 , " he said . " the @entity8 is so wild and unpredictable . i 've never been this nervous for a competition in my entire life . i 'm upset with the performance i had , but i left everything i had out there . " the 101.45 points @entity28 accrued in such incredible style thursday gave him sufficient buffer to take the gold with a total of 280.09 . @entity21 took silver on 275.62 points , but it will be little consolation with ultimate triumph within his grasp . @entity50 of @entity51 won the bronze . @entity21 admitted he had felt the pressure in bidding for @entity22 's first gold of the @entity20 . " we 're all human . even ( snowboard star ) @entity56 makes mistakes . unfortunately , i made one too many , " the 23 - year - old said . @entity61 's main hope , @entity62 , had to pull out before the start of the short program after damaging his back in the warmup . @entity68 upsets the odds earlier friday , the upsets continued in the alpine skiing competition as @entity68 's @entity72 took the men 's super-combined title . the 28 - year - old had never won a medal in a major championship and had won just a single @entity79 event . but his combined time of two minutes 45.20 seconds over the downhill and slalom runs gave him gold . " this is amazing -- it 's perfect , it 's more than a dream come true . it 's also a big shock . i did n't think i would come first , " he said . @entity91 veteran @entity90 finished second , 0.34 seconds behind @entity72 , to claim his fourth @entity25 silver and third in the combined . he was competing on a slalom course set by his father , who also coaches him . all the coaches of the top - 15 ranked skiers go into a lottery to decide who will can lay out the course and @entity101 won the draw . @entity104 's @entity103 followed his silver in sunday 's downhill by claiming the bronze medal . he had only praise for the course designer , despite finishing behind his son . " i thank @entity101 for setting a good course , " he said . but defending champion @entity111 never recovered after a disappointing downhill run and finished sixth while world champion and @entity115 compatriot @entity113 trailed home 12th . the variable ski conditions may have worked against the favorites , as @entity113 suggested after his disappointing performance . " they really make for funky results . you can see the results sheet so far . it 's far from the @entity79 result sheets , " he said . " but we all have to ski and deal with it . there are no excuses . " @entity133 hope @entity131 , like @entity113 a dominant force on the @entity79 , also finished outside the top 10 . more @entity68 success double gold was also a strong theme on day seven of competition , with @entity140 making it a great day for @entity68 by winning the 15 km classic in the cross-country nordic skiing discipline . it was a successful defense of the title he won in @entity147 and followed his earlier triumph in the 30 km skiathlon in @entity9 . @entity140 came into the @entity20 off the back of injury problems , and his performances have taken him by surprise . " it 's amazing . i could n't believe the first gold medal , after being injured , and now the second . it was the perfect race . i knew it would be hard and i was prepared for it , " he said . @entity163 gold double @entity164 from @entity163 made it two golds in three days with victory in the women 's 15 km individual biathlon race . she took the bronze in @entity147 but stepped up to the top of the podium in @entity9 , beating @entity68 's @entity173 into second place , with compatriot @entity175 in third . @entity164 took the women 's pursuit title tuesday on tuesday and was in unbeatable form again , particularly in the shooting section of the competition . @entity163 later picked up its second gold of the day as 34 - year - old @entity183 , competing in her fifth @entity8 , finally found her way to the top of the podium in the women 's freestyle aerials competition . @entity183 had never finished higher than fifth in her previous attempts but with a total score of 98.01 she was flying high . @entity190 of @entity191 took the silver , while defending champion @entity193 of @entity194 won bronze . @entity183 took two years out to start a family but came back to competition better than ever . " i had a break for two years . i returned to the sport to have one more chance to have a medal . that was a dream , " she said . @entity203 the new skeleton queen @entity205 continued its domination of women 's skeleton as @entity203 took the title won by compatriot @entity210 four years ago . former track and field athlete @entity203 held the lead from the first run thursday at the @entity213 and finished nearly a second clear of @entity214 of the @entity115 over four sessions . @entity216 took the bronze for host nation @entity61 . " i do n't think it 's going to sink in for a long time , " said @entity203 , who had to endure some nervous moments at the start of her final run . " it was a messy fourth run but i just relaxed and enjoyed it . i wanted to do myself justice and show the world what i could do .

@placeholder - based group behind incident receives cash from evangelical christians	@entity65	( @entity0 ) -- -- the well - publicized landing of 40 @entity2 in @entity3 on tuesday spurred glee among some @entity3 and the immigrants themselves and drew public scorn from a surprising quarter in @entity7 -- two officials from its centuries - old @entity10 community . one of them described the emigration as a " misinformation " campaign and defended their lives under the government of @entity7 president @entity18 . the arrival in @entity3 was publicized as the largest single group to arrive in @entity3 from @entity7 since @entity7 's @entity21 , and the immigrants traveled via an undisclosed third country . other @entity7 @entity10 have immigrated to @entity3 over the years . anti-semitism has been a worldwide phenomenon for centuries and the state of @entity3 became a homeland for @entity10 to escape anti-semitic persecution . the group that sponsored the immigration is the @entity32 , based in @entity33 . it says it wants to help @entity10 flee such persecution . the group receives money from evangelical @entity38 . its founder , rabbi @entity39 , believes @entity7 jews face dangers , citing the words of @entity18 , who has urged @entity3 's destruction but not by military means . there has been great criticism of @entity18 by @entity10 across the globe for his remarks about @entity3 , for the government 's stance toward @entity3 , and for the regime 's sponsorship of a recent holocaust denial seminar . @entity39 said immigrants received $ 10,000 each because they left behind possessions to go to @entity3 . noting the evangelical support from his group , @entity39 , in fact , believes it 's no " coincidence " that the people came to @entity3 on christmas day , which @entity39 describes as " kind of a @entity63 present to these folks from @entity38 in @entity65 who seek to tell @entity3 and the @entity10 people that they 're not alone . " the immigration comes at a time of great tension between @entity7 , whose president stoutly rejects the jewish state 's existence , and @entity3 , which asserts that @entity7 is funding terrorism , has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons , and is intent on destroying the jewish state . but the account of the mass immigration was vehemently disputed among @entity10 officials in @entity81 who defend @entity10 life there . the man representing @entity7 jews in @entity7 's parliament on wednesday disputed the notion of an organized immigration of @entity2 to @entity3 , saying he would have known about such a development . @entity7 mp @entity88 told @entity0 that he and @entity89 , the director of the @entity90 , had issued a statement condemning the spread of false news about an evangelical organization facilitating the immigration of 40 @entity7 jews to @entity3 . @entity7 @entity10 can travel anywhere they want , anytime they want , but like other @entity7 they are not allowed to go to @entity3 , @entity97 said . even with that , some @entity7 jews may decide to travel to and from @entity3 via a third country to visit their families or to visit for religious reasons . however , @entity97 called the news a " misinformation " campaign aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust between the @entity108 and @entity10 communities in @entity7 . he said it is meant to make @entity7 jews feel unsafe and vulnerable in their own country . he said that before the @entity21 in 1979 , @entity7 @entity10 numbered more than 100,000 , but like other minorities their numbers diminished because of immigration . he said almost 95 percent of @entity2 went to the @entity65 and as a result there is now quite a sizable @entity7 jewish community there . the remaining 5 percent , he said , went to @entity119 and @entity3 . there are as many as an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 @entity10 remaining in @entity7 , the largest jewish community in the @entity122 outside @entity3 , according to @entity0 's @entity123 . the @entity125 's 2007 report on religious freedom says the @entity7 government 's " rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all @entity132 religious groups , most notably for @entity133 's , " who are based in the @entity3 city of @entity136 . it also cites " @entity138 , evangelical christians , and members of the @entity10 community . " jews by @entity7 constitutional law have the right to practice their religion and " with some exception , " there has been scant government restriction and interference with religious practices , the report said . however , " members of these recognized minority religious groups have reported government imprisonment , harassment , intimidation , and discrimination based on their religious beliefs . " jewish education has been tougher to carry out , there has been a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric , and assaults on two synagogues , the report said . their contact with or support for the state of @entity3 has been squelched " out of fear of reprisal . " " recent anti-american and anti-israeli demonstrations included the denunciation of @entity10 , as opposed to the past practice of denouncing only ' @entity3 ' and " @entity175 , " adding to the threatening atmosphere for the community , " the report said . in the @entity180 's @entity10 community , there is a different view from voices emerging . @entity89 described the @entity10 community in @entity81 as alive and well , with 20 synagogues , more than eight butcher shops , two restaurants , and four youth groups . " there is no doubt that the @entity190 happened , " he said . " but we disagree with the superpowers who have misused this incident to their own benefit .

@placeholder was known as a thorn in the side of police and an advocate for the little guy	@entity32	( @entity0 ) -- a line of angry protesters waving signs and wearing scows formed a ring around the front entrance of the @entity8 ' headquarters . they took turns at the bullhorn accusing the paper of everything from libel to genocide . they did n't bring a list of demands ; they were n't looking to negotiate . they had one goal : to shut the paper down forever . " we 're going to march until the walls come down , " one shouted . employees who would normally head out the revolving door to one of the lunch trucks along @entity29 developed a taste for cafeteria food that day . not @entity32 . @entity32 , senior editor of the newspaper they had pledged to kill , walked out the front entrance and met their scows with a broad smile . picketers committed to the complete destruction of the @entity8 returned his smile or nodded in recognition as they passed him . a few even shook his hand . i 'll never forget that scene . it was , at once , improbable yet typical of a man who was as comfortable in the salons of power as he was in the embrace of the disadvantaged . @entity32 was the last man you 'd pick out of a lineup of guys suspected of aiding and abetting dangerous felons . in his horn - rimmed glasses , hand - tied , silk bowties and graying crew cut , he looked like a grown - up version of the nerds that tough guys used to beat up to burnish their reps . but fugitives who were wanted for vicious assaults and heinous crimes would call @entity32 before they called their lawyers . in a town where some cops were known to administer curbside justice , surrendering to @entity32 was a way to keep from having their faces rearranged on the way to jail . at least 75 fugitives did just that over @entity32 's 19 - year career . in 1981 , he negotiated the release of six prison guards being held hostage by a band of armed inmates whose leader was doing life for killing a cop . prisoners guards and a remarkably composed @entity32 emerged unscathed from the two - day ordeal . his departure in 1991 ended a 19 - year run as the most influential columnist in town . @entity32 's courtly manners and air of refinement could disarm the unwary . but the @entity8 knew what they were getting when they hired him in 1972 . @entity96 had once dubbed him " the angry man of the negro press . " @entity99 was a target - rich environment in 1972 . @entity101 , a former police commissioner who had once left a formal dinner in a tuxedo to supervise the public strip search of a group of unarmed @entity106 , had been elected mayor . @entity32 began his @entity8 tenure in time to see four @entity110 members , including the city council president get ensnared in the @entity113 net . in a one - party town where an inbred @entity117 machine reigned supreme , @entity32 was like a kid in a candy shop . he attacked police brutality , political corruption , the chronic failure of public schools and institutional injustice twice a week in the @entity8 and weekly on his aptly - named tv show , " on @entity126 " . he was the @entity8 ' first black columnist . but he never saw color when he was looking through his gun sights . he described @entity129 , the city 's first black mayor , as a " paternalistic ferret . " when state rep. @entity132 was the most - powerful black politician in the state capital , @entity32 called him " an oleaginous eel . " the @entity136 language was a sharp tool in his hands . he described one of his targets as a " retromingent , " a term for an animal who urinates backward . but he could be effusive in praise . he originated the @entity146 , an honor named for a cop known for the kind of firm but fair police work which @entity32 advocated . his death on april 6 at age 89 ended a lifetime of service . he was trained as a @entity155 in a segregated @entity156 in @entity157 . he had worked overseas for an international aid organization in the ' 50s . in the ' 60s , he was a special assistant to @entity160 rep. @entity159 and later authored three books . he ended his career as a professor of journalism at the @entity164 at @entity165 , before retiring five years ago . perhaps his most lasting legacy is as a founder of the @entity168 . @entity169 , a @entity170 - winning columnist and @entity168 co-founder once described him as the first amongst equals in founding @entity168 .

@placeholder has signed a $ 240 million sponsorship deal with @entity3	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 have tied up a $ 240 million deal with @entity3 as the club looks to end its seven year trophy drought . the @entity7 club has extended its shirt partnership with @entity3 until the end of the 2018/19 season , while the airline will also continue its hold on naming rights of the stadium until 2028 . the sponsorship , which is estimated to be worth around $ 48 million a year , has been hailed as a deal ' all about football ' by @entity1 chief executive @entity18 , who insisted money would be available for player investment in june 2013 when the club receives the first payment from @entity3 . the latest agreement , according to @entity18 , will give @entity1 , " the resources in what we believe is a responsible and well managed way , to be able to invest in what we put onto the pitch for our fans . " @entity29 sends @entity31 packing in july @entity29 signed a seven - year shirt deal with @entity34 car giant @entity33 worth $ 72 million a season up until 2021 , while @entity36 's four - year shirt deal with @entity37 which was signed back in 2009 is worth $ 128 million in total . @entity39 signed a 10 - year deal with @entity41 for naming rights and shirt sponsorship worth a reported mammoth $ 641 million only last years . but @entity1 insist that only @entity29 's shirt deal is worth more and that their deal with @entity3 is the second most valuable in @entity46 . however , the club receives around $ 85 million from sponsorships , which is far less than that of its rivals including @entity36 , @entity52 and @entity29 . and while it posted the third - best sales figures for the year ending may 31 of $ 389 million , it still lags behind its rivals on the field . the @entity58 ' inability to win a trophy since 2005 under manager @entity60 has led to supporter frustration with the team 's inability to challenge for top honors . @entity65 , an associate for @entity66 and an expert on finance within football , believes @entity1 's sponsorship deal is a sign of the impact that @entity73 is starting to have on the @entity7 . fair play ? football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap " the @entity1 deal will however only begin in time for the 2014 - 15 season which means the financial uplift is still some time away , " @entity65 told @entity0 . " depending on how the revenues are apportioned between the shirt and stadium deal , only the future @entity33 $ 72 million a season shirt deal ( also starting in 2014 - 15 ) is significantly higher in the @entity7 . " it means that in the @entity7 alone , there have been some very large recent sponsorship deals with @entity36 's $ 128 million four - year shirt sponsorship deal with @entity37 in september 2009 and @entity39 's reported 10 year $ 641m shirt , stadium and community deal with @entity41 . " bearing in mind the latest bumper @entity94 and foreign broadcasting deals that have been announced by the @entity7 ( forecasted to be around $ 8bn ) and the prospect of some type of salary cap being proposed in the @entity7 , it is clear that owners are looking to aggressively maximize revenues whilst to some degree constraining wages .

" meanwhile , a twice - beaten @entity3 finds itself doing as @entity2 often did in the @entity14 era , surveying a field of little - knowns and hoping for magic . the @entity3 field is led by two freshman senators : @entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 , plus a member of the @entity25 and the party 's 2012 vice presidential nominee , @entity28 . three things are immediately striking about the top of the @entity3 field : 1 ) it 's not only @entity0 - based , but it 's all congressionally based . there is no governor in the top three , no general , no former cabinet secretary , nobody with any notable private - sector accomplishment . 2 ) it 's light on accomplishment . @entity28 has to date been the most productive of the top three , but none of his famous budgets have been passed into law . @entity20 can cite no legislative accomplishments at all , only a stunt filibuster against the entirely imaginary menace of drone strikes against @entity48 citizens on @entity48 soil . @entity22 has taken a lead role in immigration reform but must make some tough decisions about whether his future is best secured by negotiating a deal or scuttling one . none of the three @entity3 front - runners has any administrative experience to speak of . 3 ) it 's intensely doctrinaire . @entity28 was the author of much of the @entity3 's post- 2009 tea party program . @entity22 has to date shown himself an undeviating follower of that program . @entity20 dissents from some aspects of that program but in the direction of even greater extremism . a party rebuilding from back - to - back presidential defeats has to face the possibility that the problem may be bigger than its candidate , bigger than its campaign tactics . there are a couple of obvious ways to address that possibility : the party might look for an outsider nominee , a candidate so attractive in his or her own right as to offset the party 's own unpopularity . this is what @entity3 did by nominating @entity84 in 1952 after five consecutive defeats by @entity86 @entity2 . or the party might allow an insider some latitude to edge back toward the political center . this is what @entity2 did in 1992 when they nominated a pro-death penalty , pro-welfare reform , pro-free trade governor of @entity94 after losses under the party - line liberals , @entity97 and @entity98 . in 2016 , however , @entity3 as yet show no inclination to try either remedy . no independent superstar ; no deviation from party line orthodoxy . the one @entity3 with the highest cross-partisan appeal , @entity106 gov. @entity105 , has been consigned to fourth place . as the saying goes , the first step toward recovery is to acknowledge the problem . the problem in 2012 -- as in 2008 , as in the near - death experience of 2004 , as in the popular vote loss of 2000 , as in the loss of 1996 , as in the loss of 1992 -- was the @entity3 's failure to offer an economic program relevant to the problems of middle - class @entity48 . the party 's present three front - runners would not only repeat that failure , but double down on that failure . the @entity3 desperately needs renewal , its early presidential front - runners are characterized by their rejection of change . at a time when voters reject generic @entity132 , @entity3 themselves are rallying to two of the most generic @entity3 in the party -- and a third , @entity20 , who diverges from generic @entity132 only by offering voters even more of what they most dislike about today 's @entity3 . the party talks about learning from its mistakes . thus far , the main thing the party seems to have learned from those mistakes is how to repeat them . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .	@entity22:Marco Rubio	@entity23:Florida	@entity20:Rand Paul	@entity21:Kentucky	@entity25:House	@entity28:Ryan	@entity84:Dwight Eisenhower	@entity86:New Deal	@entity153:Frum	@entity132:Republicanism	@entity3:GOP	@entity2:Democrats	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity8:Hillary Clinton	@entity14:Reagan	@entity105:Chris Christie	@entity106:New Jersey	@entity98:Michael Dukakis	@entity97:Walter Mondale	@entity94:Arkansas	@entity143:David Frum	@entity48:Americans
former @placeholder soccer player @entity57 lambasts parents ' spouting nonsense ' at children	@entity59	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the village of @entity3 in @entity4 is sleepy , picturesque , and does not normally make national news . but it hit the headlines this month when a controversial sign was put up at the children 's rugby club . " please remember ! these are kids , " it said . " this is a game . the coaches are volunteers . the referees are human . this is not the @entity17 . " this sign was quickly reported by the press , and even featured on today , @entity20 's flagship politics and current affairs program . clearly , the @entity3 kids ' rugby club had touched a nerve . rugby culture is good - natured in @entity27 , and a sign of this sort is unusual . but a host of other junior pastimes , including soccer , @entity27 's national sport , is plagued by adult boorishness . in march , the @entity35 staged a " silent weekend " for all soccer teams aged seven to 18 . parents were allowed to applaud when players from both teams entered or exited the pitch , or scored a goal . otherwise , they watched in silence . @entity43 , the @entity35 's county welfare officer , came up with the idea after seeing a nine - year - old boy reduced to tears during a game . " he was genuinely scared , " he said . " poor lad was simply terrified by all those baying adults . " by all accounts , the initiative was a success . but it was also a drop in the ocean . last year , @entity57 , the legendary @entity59 footballer and television presenter -- who incidentally never received a single yellow card for unsporting behavior throughout his playing career -- lambasted " maniacal parents on the touchline spouting nonsense at their children . " " the competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding , " he wrote in an essay for @entity69 magazine . " if we could just get them to shut the f --- up and let their children enjoy themselves , you 'd be staggered at the difference it would make . " @entity57 even went so far as to hold parents ' behavior partially responsible for the stunted development of @entity84 soccer , which has " never produced , proportionally , as many technically efficient players as most other countries . " parental behavior on the touchlines is a deep - seated problem in the @entity27 . a 2011 study by @entity91 found that three quarters of @entity27 children had endured " unhelpful criticism of performance , being shouted and sworn at , being embarrassed and humiliated " . " disrespectful and emotionally harmful treatment of young people , " it concluded , is " commonplace in children 's experience of sport in the @entity27 . " it is also a problem elsewhere in the world . a definitive poll of 23,000 adults in 23 countries , carried out jointly by @entity108 and @entity109 in 2010 , found that 60 % of @entity110 had witnessed bad behavior by a parent on a touchline . this was reflected by 59 % of @entity115 ; 55 % of @entity116 ; 54 % of @entity117 ; 53 % of @entity118 ; and 50 % of @entity119 . what lies behind this ugly trend ? partly , it has to be chemical . studies have shown that spectators as well as players experience a flood of testosterone after a win , making it easy for parents to lose a sense of perspective when their children are competing . there are also convincing psychological explanations . the late professor @entity136 , a pre-eminent family therapy expert at @entity138 , blamed a lack of " completeness " in parents , leading to a belief that the child 's successes are an extension of their own . all this pressure , he argued , is intensified by the fact that away from the sports field , cosseted modern life offers few opportunities for blood - and - guts heroics . professor @entity136 suggested that parents distance themselves from the action : the more likely you are to start yelling , the further away you should sit . " for you it 's venting , but for your kid it 's damaging in so many ways , " he said in an interview with his university magazine . " they may start to feel that they 're losers not only in the game , but in life . " whatever the excuses , parents need to get a grip . but despite the success of initiatives like @entity171 , it would be a mistake to go to the other extreme and sanitize children 's sports . @entity177 's bestselling book " how children succeed " -- which has revolutionized thinking in @entity110 's public schools -- has demonstrated that qualities like grit , determination , optimism and discipline are key determinants of success in life . if such " mental toughness " can not be forged on the sports field , how can it be developed at all ? it may be " only a game , " but character - building is surely the whole point . many adults tell epiphanic stories of the moment a tough - love adult gave them the self - belief and drive they needed , even though it was unpleasant at the time . my wife , for instance , credits a painful school athletics session , in which her coach refused to let her leave until she had jumped the highest hurdles , with her subsequent junior sporting success . for this to work , however , the overall context has to be healthy . @entity214 - coddling children may not do them any good , but any tough love must be designed to make them stronger , not break them . and for that to happen , the adults on the touchlines must learn to grow up -- whether their kids are playing rugby or anything else .	@entity20:BBC Radio	@entity27:UK	@entity117:Argentinians	@entity116:Italians	@entity115:Indians	@entity84:English	@entity138:Kansas State University	@entity110:America	@entity136:Jurich	@entity119:Australians	@entity118:Canadians	@entity3:Beddau	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity177:Paul Tough	@entity4:South Wales	@entity57:Gary Lineker	@entity59:England	@entity17:Six Nations	@entity171:Silent Weekend	@entity35:Football Association	@entity69:New Statesman	@entity214:Molly	@entity243:Jake Wallis Simons	@entity108:Reuters	@entity109:Ipsos	@entity91:Edinburgh University	@entity43:Neil Yates

@entity13 wants to see his team play at @placeholder 's @entity19 or @entity104	@entity11	" @entity0 , what we do in life echoes in eternity " ( line from the film @entity7 ) gladiators , ready ? from the ancient ruins of @entity11 , a new empire rises . but with a nod to the past , the city 's newest gladiator @entity13 's eyes light up when his thoughts turn to historic sites like the @entity19 . for if all roads lead to @entity11 , the @entity22 president is leaving no stone unturned in his intention to marry the @entity11 's historic past with @entity28 football 's new emerging force . " i have one big goal , " @entity13 tells @entity29 , with an infectious smile . " i want to get the city to let us play somebody like @entity35 or @entity36 or someone like that at the @entity19 . " while the idea might have the marketing department rubbing their hands with glee , @entity13 could have his work cut out , persuading those maintaining these sites to allow @entity47 and @entity48 to put on an altogether different kind of gladiatorial show . commissioned by @entity51 , the @entity19 remains @entity11 's most iconic monument and while others may not have ever considered bring the modern day roman legion to entertain the masses , @entity13 is not like any other owner . " we 'll do a pay - per - view on it , $ 25 around the world , " adds the @entity58 , elaborating on the idea . " we could get 300 million people wanting to watch that around the world -- a game in the @entity19 which they 'll never see again . " we take that money , which could be billions of dollars , and then set up a foundation in @entity11 to fix up the antiquities even faster and put the rest towards inner city programs in @entity11 . " @entity51 died before he could see the @entity19 completed by his son , @entity72 , in ad 80 , with the 55,000 arena becoming an integral part of @entity11 's history . @entity13 jokes he would n't mind seeing a few lions let out of the traps to speed up the match tempo , and the 56 - year - old @entity80 - born investor , who took over the job of rebuilding @entity22 in 2012 , is clearly a man in a hurry . while millions flock to the @entity28 capital to gaze upon the likes of @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 , @entity13 wants future visitors to embrace a new modern @entity22 . " when you walk around the city , you can not keep your head down , " he said . " you have to look up because of the architecture and every step you take is amazing . " for us not to have @entity11 be a significant part of what we are doing with the team would be foolish . " a fixture between @entity22 against world class opposition at the @entity19 or perhaps more realistically , at the @entity104 given rock concerts have been staged there , is just one of @entity13 's many ideas . neither @entity35 nor @entity36 responded to @entity29 's request to see if they would consider playing against @entity22 in one of these venues in a friendly . however , more tangible is @entity13 's intention to provide @entity11 with a new stadium which the club hopes will be ready for the 2016 - 17 season . able to accommodate up to 60,000 people , the arena is intended to become the focal point for a new chapter in the club 's history . a " @entity129 " will be built adjacent to the stadium providing facilities for the club 's first and youth teams to train , while a deal has been struck with local authorities to extend the metro line allowing easier access for supporters . a new club village , which will host restaurants , bars and shops will also be built with the 13,500 square meter fanzone helping to create thousands of jobs . given that @entity11 was not built in a day , @entity13 has big plans for @entity22 's youth academy and the city 's youngsters . " in the past year , we had @entity22 kids on our shirts which is the foundation we set up for inner city programs in @entity11 , " explained the @entity80 . " in terms of the youth side of things , we 've got good programs but what we 've instituted is a new educational framework . " i did n't think we were doing enough . we know only three or four kids are going to make it to @entity152 or the @entity154 , so what are they going to do when they 're 18 or 19 ? " are they going to be a clerk somewhere ? or get a menial job with no education ? " so we instituted a 9th - 12th grade formal program which is online and this will help them get into college . " they 'll get accredited if they ca n't make it in football and we 'll help them . " a fan of @entity171 franchise @entity170 , @entity13 is well aware of the role that history can have in promoting a brand and he has used some of the @entity171 's ideas to help reinvigorate @entity22 . a @entity177 was set up following a vote by supporters , while the club 's logo was changed and the name ' as @entity22 ' registered as a trademark . he is hoping that the likes of inspirational captain @entity47 , known as ' @entity185 , ' will remain at the club when he retires in an ambassadorial role . @entity13 talks about how each of the players is like a son to him , while he insists that those who work in the kitchens or security department equally command his respect . " @entity47 is going to be with us forever , " says @entity13 with that trademark smile as he talks about the 38 - year - old player , who made his debut for @entity22 at the age of 16 . " part of the role will be defined by him on what he wants to do . " we would like him to be around the pitch , talking to people who are coming into the club and telling them , ' i 've been here 20 years , this is what @entity22 's all about . ' " you would love to have him with the youth team and once in a while actually going out there and having a drill with them . " and the other thing you 'd love is for him to be an ambassador for us . if i 'm a nine - year - old and @entity47 walks in and sits down with you and your parents and says ' i was here and this is what is going on at @entity22 ' then the kids will be thinking ' ok , wow . ' " while the past and future are being taken care of , the present is very much up to those on the field of play . @entity22 , which faces @entity36 in the @entity230 tuesday , has made an encouraging start to the domestic and @entity233 season . under head coach @entity235 , the team has impressed with the likes of @entity47 , @entity237 , and @entity238 all catching the eye . all three men played a vital role in @entity22 's 3 - 0 win over @entity243 last weekend -- a result which leaves the team in second place and just one point behind leaders @entity249 . @entity36 represents the biggest test faced by @entity22 at the @entity251 so far this season but for @entity13 , it is these kind of challenges which has put his club back in the big time . " people are starting to talk more about what is going on at @entity22 , " @entity13 says with a smile . " it 's a long - term thing . you can do it in one or two years and people will think it 's a fluke , but the objective is to do it over 20 years and have that stability . " we want to be in the @entity230 , compete for the title which i feel we can do this year .

for @placeholder , @entity5 and @entity35 dedicated 12 hours to music videos	@entity34	( @entity0 ) -- children of the ' 80s and ' 90s fondly remember a time when @entity5 actually played music videos . it was an era filled with art and glory and rebellion , and our parents were convinced this devil channel would surely encourage us to snort drugs and murder puppies and alter our report cards so that a d in math looked like a @entity19 truth be told , i almost got away with that last one . it was definitely worth a shot . but i hardly fault @entity24 for my dishonesty . i blame long division . of course , these days , @entity5 is known for its reality programming , and the network has basically become a giant bouncy castle for @entity30 's drunk , tanned , and pregnant . as a viewer , it 's kind of like virtually enrolling at @entity33 . however , on thursday , to celebrate the @entity34 , @entity5 and @entity35 decided to go with 12 straight hours of music video programming . and news of this decision played out nicely all over the web as excitement built for a short taste of that bygone era . though , to be fair , the online anticipation rather reeked of moth balls . the younger generation probably did n't care . damn kids . get off my lawn . after reading a few of the many trending articles about the upcoming " @entity51 , " i actually spent some time wednesday afternoon nostalgically searching @entity52 for old videos from what many argue were @entity5 's glory years -- when @entity56 competed for airtime with @entity58 and @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 and sir @entity62 . yes , those were the days . or maybe these are the days . the very thing i was doing -- instantly calling up videos on @entity52 -- is part of the reason why @entity5 does n't air them in the first place . we 've got everything we want just one mouse click and @entity76 link away . so , do n't hate on @entity5 . it 's a business . and if there was money in music videos , that 's what they would show . but there 's not . the real money is in watching rich kids try to boink each other on @entity88 . however , not during @entity30 's @entity34 ! thus , as a civic duty to my generation , i decided to dedicate one full hour of my afternoon to channel surfing between @entity5 and @entity35 just to see what the music video experience feels like in 2013 . yes , it was tough investigative journalism . but at least it did n't require pants . my mission started just around 1 p.m. when , after several minutes of cable box confusion , i finally clicked over to the low - numbered @entity102 channel for @entity5 . apparently , i do n't get it in high def. and i have to say that being out of the 800s felt dirty and weird . " people actually watch this crap ? " nevertheless , i bravely entered a proletariat cave of low technology , and the first video already playing was ' @entity112 's " @entity111 " from the late ' 90s . of course , it was that absolutely terrible boy band music , but at least it was fun to see a young @entity117 in the early stages of his world domination . the next video was @entity122 's " @entity121 , " at which point i promptly moved like @entity124 over to @entity35 . mind you , the song is totally fine , but there 's just a whole lot going on in the video -- too much movement -- and i was fairly certain i was about to have a seizure . @entity5 's sister network , on the other hand , seemed to be dedicating the bulk of its airtime to emerging indie bands , and i was immediately introduced to a duo called @entity138 and their video for " @entity140 . " it was decent , actually . and slower . thus , i was no longer foaming from the mouth . so , things were looking up . throughout the rest of the hour , i surfed back and forth , catching videos from artists i 'd never heard of like @entity147 and @entity148 . and i also saw some hits from more mainstream talent like @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153 . the highlight was actually @entity156 's " @entity155 . " and i ca n't believe i just wrote that . but it 's a video that simply does n't disappoint . it 's colorful and happy and absurd , and somehow it just fixes any situation . " i 'm afraid the test results show you have syphilis . " " it 's all good , doc. everyday i 'm shufflin ' ! " " right . but seriously . you 're gon na need some penicillin . " in the end , my hour of modern music videos definitely was n't what i remembered from my youth , but it was still interesting and fun while it lasted . that said , i admit i was more than happy to turn off the tv and move on to other things . i 'm a busy man , and it 's not like i can outsource my regularly scheduled 2 p.m. nap . not that it matters , what with all the noise coming from outside . damn kids . get off my lawn .	@entity24:Guns N ' Roses	@entity117:Justin Timberlake	@entity153:Gwen Stefani	@entity112:N Sync	@entity111:Tearin ' Up My Heart	@entity88:Laguna Beach	@entity152:Outkast	@entity151:Eminem	@entity156:LMFAO	@entity155:Party Rock Anthem	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:MTV	@entity52:YouTube	@entity51:Music Independence Day	@entity56:Nirvana	@entity58:Eric Clapton	@entity59:Van Halen	@entity76:Twitter	@entity30:America	@entity33:Arizona State	@entity35:VH1	@entity34:Independence Day	@entity19:B.	@entity102:SD	@entity124:Jagger	@entity122:Maroon 5	@entity121:Moves Like Jagger	@entity147:Nabiha	@entity140:Heart Beats	@entity148:Flume	@entity61:R.E.M.	@entity62:Mix-a-Lot	@entity60:Metallica	@entity138:Johnnyswim

" we want to see them work together to go beyond rhetoric , " @placeholder says of @entity10 and @entity6	@entity0	@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 waded into the thicket of @entity4 politics friday , chiding the @entity6 prime minister for a slam on @entity8 while touting the ties the @entity1 has with @entity6 and @entity10 -- two once friendly nations now mired in antipathy . @entity0 said he and the @entity14 administration disagreed with @entity16 's remark equating @entity8 with crimes against humanity , and he called it " objectionable . " he appeared to be making a reference to the remark in his praise of @entity23 , the @entity6 guard at the @entity24 in @entity25 who died in a february 1 suicide attack . " @entity23 's tragic death reminds all of us of the common bond we share , " @entity0 told reporters in a joint news conference in @entity25 with @entity6 foreign minister @entity29 . it " underscores the urgent need to promote a spirit of tolerance that includes all of the public statements made by all leaders . " @entity0 said he mentioned @entity16 's speech to the foreign minister and plans to broach it with @entity16 . " that said , @entity6 and @entity10 are both vital allies , " @entity0 said . " we want to see them work together to go beyond rhetoric and take concrete steps to change their relationship . i believe it 's possible . " the remarks overshadowed the key crisis in the region : the @entity55 civil war . @entity0 said the @entity1 and @entity6 share opposition to the regime of @entity58 in @entity55 . he said that @entity6 and the @entity1 believe in a political solution in @entity55 and that both countries have worked to bring about tough sanctions to reduce money flowing to the @entity58 government . he cited the @entity65 missiles placed on @entity6 's border with @entity55 for security and the country 's hosting of tens of thousands of @entity55 refugees . " minister @entity29 and i believe there is no legitimacy in a regime that creates atrocities against its own people , " @entity0 said . @entity0 attended a memorial service for the security guard killed at the embassy last month and described him as a " courageous @entity79 . " the @entity1 , he said , " stands strongly with @entity6 , our @entity80 ally in the fight against terrorism . " the embassy was attacked last month by a man @entity6 authorities say belonged to the @entity88 organization known as the @entity90 's @entity89 , or @entity91 , which the @entity1 government and others label a terrorist organization . as for @entity16 's remarks , a senior @entity96 official earlier said the comment was " particularly offensive " and " complicates our ability to do all the things we want to do together when we have such a profound disagreement about such an important thing , " @entity16 appeared at the @entity103 , which works to defuse tensions and promote cooperation between the @entity107 and @entity108 worlds . " it is necessary that we must consider -- just like @entity8 , or anti-semitism , or fascism -- islamophobia as a crime against humanity , " the @entity6 prime minister said . @entity8 is the @entity116 national liberation movement that led to @entity10 's founding and is the nation 's underpinning . @entity16 's remarks drew a quick rebuke from @entity10 prime minister @entity121 . but many in the @entity107 world harbor notions like @entity16 's about the movement . " this is a dark and mendacious statement , the likes of which we thought had passed from the world , " @entity121 said . @entity10 and @entity6 are major @entity1 allies in the @entity4 . but the once extensive cooperation between @entity6 and @entity10 on trade , tourism and military issues has broken down . @entity6 , a @entity80 member , has been affected by one of the world 's most volatile conflicts -- the @entity55 civil war -- and has been a staunch opponent of the @entity58 regime . @entity10 has been a longtime friend of the @entity1 and is seen as a pro- @entity1 bulwark in the region . the falling out between @entity6 and @entity10 was hastened by the @entity10 commando attack on a ship in a @entity148 - bound flotilla three years ago . @entity6 has called for an apology for the incident , which resulted in the deaths of eight @entity6 and one @entity1 of @entity6 origin . @entity0 : diplomacy is cheaper than no diplomacy	@entity23:Mustafa	@entity24:U.S. Embassy	@entity25:Ankara	@entity29:Davutoglu	@entity80:NATO	@entity116:Jewish	@entity88:Marxist Leninist	@entity89:Liberation Party	@entity1:U.S.	@entity0:Kerry	@entity6:Turkish	@entity4:Middle East	@entity8:Zionism	@entity79:Turk	@entity55:Syria	@entity58:Assad	@entity16:Recep Tayyip Erdogan	@entity14:Obama	@entity10:Israel	@entity103:U.N.

" however , he took a few stabs at the @entity8 in its handling of @entity23 allegations that @entity17 was attempting to purchase uranium from @entity25 to manufacture nuclear weapons . @entity15 was dispatched to @entity25 on a @entity8 assignment to explore the charges and later said that the @entity30 administration was twisting facts to support an invasion of @entity17 . he implied in a newspaper article that his trip was at the behest of the vice president . @entity2 's reaction to the article was that it was " amateur hour " at the @entity8 , according to the @entity10 documents , released after the @entity39 , a watchdog group in @entity0 , sued under the @entity40 . the 28 - page summary of the @entity2 interview was made public more than five years after it took place . @entity2 , his chief of staff , @entity46 , and presidential adviser @entity47 , were named in a 2006 federal civil lawsuit by @entity7 and @entity15 . @entity7 contended she was the victim of intentional and malicious exposure and that both she and @entity15 suffered a violation of rights . the lawsuit was dismissed in 2007 . only @entity53 was tried and convicted of perjury , obstruction and lying to the @entity10 about the @entity7 leak . president @entity30 later commuted his sentence . @entity2 told the @entity10 he did not recall discussing @entity7 with @entity53 prior to her name being published in a column by @entity60 in july 2003 , and said he had no knowledge of @entity53 's meeting with @entity64 reporter @entity63 a week before @entity7 was identified . in closing arguments at @entity53 's trial , special prosecutor @entity65 said " a cloud over the vice-president " persisted . @entity70 , executive director of @entity39 , said : " mr. @entity2 's near total amnesia regarding his role in this monumental @entity0 scandal -- resulting in the conviction of his top aide -- shows why .

technique called panning used to capture unusual shot of @entity5 at 2010 @placeholder	@entity20	( @entity0 ) -- it might be a bit of a blur to everyone else , but @entity5 always seems to keep a clear head -- even in the most pressurized situations . and if the football maestro 's opponents struggle to keep up with him , spare a thought for the sports photographers who have to track his moments of magic . @entity15 's artful image of the @entity17 star in action against @entity19 at the last @entity20 in @entity21 captures his dynamism down to a tee . but it was n't the shot he had expected to walk away with at @entity28 's @entity27 that evening . " i had planned to go up into the crowd , " @entity15 told @entity0 's @entity30 series . " i found a position in the stands which i thought might give me a different angle , but a steward took exception to me being there . " the @entity38 - accredited @entity15 protested , stayed put and the game started . then the police arrived . " about 10 of them showed up in full riot gear and said , ' you ca n't stay here . ' i was n't going to argue , so i was escorted down to the pitch where they thought all the photographers should be . " i kind of squeezed in late -- not in a great position -- and i thought i might as well just go for it . @entity5 is playing and if i can get one image of him like this , i 'll be happy . " the image was captured using a technique called panning , where the photographer follows a moving subject during an exposure . a successful shot will blur the background , giving a sense of movement and speed while keeping the subject , or part of it , in focus . " i had a couple of attempts earlier that did n't really work -- a lot of the frames are a complete blur . but then luckily he had a good run down the wing , " says @entity15 , who is senior @entity20 photographer at leading agency @entity70 . " the key thing you 're trying to do is freeze the head , and we 're quite lucky that the ball looks fairly frozen as well . " the image was captured using a 400 mm telephoto lens mounted on a monopod , with @entity15 opting for a super-slow shutter speed -- around one - eighth of a second compared with 1,000th of a second typically used for action shots . @entity5 's forward - leaning , athletic pose is amplified by the disorganized tangle of arms and legs of his straggling opponent . " it actually works better in other sports , particularly ones when they 're on a predictable path like athletics or speed skating , " @entity15 says of the panning technique . " you know they 're going to be at a particular place and you can try again and again . the nature of football is very zigzag ... so you do n't get many of these . " @entity15 also turned his lens on @entity5 's national coach during the 2010 tournament , capturing @entity108 celebrating the winning goal in his first match in charge at a @entity20 finals . even more impressively , he took the defining image of the final between the @entity115 and @entity116 , dropping the shutter at the exact moment @entity120 's boot clattered into @entity122 's chest . when he 's not snapping a match action , the 52 - year - old is always on the lookout for salable pictures elsewhere . " you 've always got to have your camera with you just in case . you never know what 's going to be happening anywhere , " he says . a good example was a beautiful shot of kids playing football taken in the week before the 2010 tournament kicked off . " we were driving back from @entity28 when my colleague saw these children playing football in this sort of dirt ditch on the edge of a very large township , " @entity15 explains . " the office and the world media were crying out for an image that showed football in @entity21 and i 'd like to think that this one summed it up quite nicely . " another enduring photo has been one @entity15 took two decades ago at the tournament hosted by the @entity153 the image of @entity157 players ' hands clutching the trophy following their penalty shootout victory over @entity160 in the 1994 final will be instantly recognizable to football fans worldwide . " we had exhausted all the team photos of them and i just happened to notice a couple of them trying to get their hands on the trophy , " @entity15 says . " i think a large part of its success is that you 've got different ethnic groups holding it -- you 've got white guys and black guys . i think this is @entity179 and @entity180 holding the trophy . " " it 's probably my biggest - selling image . it 's been used everywhere . you see it on games , books and god knows what ! " he says . as @entity192 2014 heads toward its climax in @entity195 's famous @entity194 on sunday , @entity15 will be pitch - side once again , ready for another shot at getting his name onto the front pages . it 's what he lives for .

@entity4 beat @placeholder in penalty shoot out to win @entity6	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 scored the winner in a dramatic penalty shoot out as @entity4 beat @entity5 on saturday to win the @entity6 for the first time . the @entity9 striker coolly slotted home his kick to spark frenzied celebrations among his teammates and the @entity4 fans in @entity5 's @entity14 . @entity15 had saved @entity17 's first penalty for @entity4 to give @entity5 the early advantage in the shootout , but @entity20 saved a weak @entity22 effort before @entity23 saw his penalty hit the post . the match had finished 1 - 1 after extra time , with @entity28 putting @entity5 ahead in the 83rd minute before @entity1 dramatically leveled with two minutes remaining . @entity29 then missed a penalty in the first half of extra time , setting up the dramatic shootout finale where the home side fluffed their lines to leave the @entity36 fans stunned . @entity4 's victory capped a remarkable spell for @entity39 since taking over as interim manager after the sacking of @entity42 . abramovich triumphant he has led the west @entity45 side to the @entity46 and finally fulfilled the ambitions of the club 's @entity49 owner @entity48 in lifting @entity52 's top club prize . @entity48 has ploughed an estimated $ 1 billion into buying the players to turn @entity4 into a @entity55 power since buying the club in 2003 and gone through eight managers in that time , but the closest he had come to the @entity6 was a penalty shoot out loss to @entity60 in 2008 . in the end , it was temporary option @entity39 who delivered the famous trophy , and despite also guiding the team to @entity46 glory , the @entity67 coach must wait to find out if he will be appointed on a permanent basis . @entity71 , suspended for the final after being sent off in the semifinal win over @entity74 , changed into his kit after the final whistle and collected the trophy from @entity52 president @entity78 with @entity79 , who was captain on the night . @entity79 paid tribute to @entity1 , whose goal rescued them in normal time before he applied the finishing touches to their triumph . " i ca n't believe it . the determination we 've shown ... we did n't play fantastic but the main man @entity90 dug us out of trouble there , " he told @entity87 . " he 's a hero . without him we 're not here . he scores the goals in the big games .

" we missed too many chances , " @entity164 told @entity166 . " we played well overall and had the majority of possession . " but we did n't know how to exploit our many opportunities and you have to use them or you will be punished .

he says it 's predictable that @placeholder would admit wrongs to @entity4	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- the advance buildup has all been about @entity2 as he prepares to enter the church of @entity4 and seek absolution for his sins . but this much - anticipated television moment is as much a test for @entity9 as for the disgraced former cycling champion . for while @entity2 is no longer the hero of old , @entity4 is n't the same old @entity4 , either . the interview , to be conducted monday , wo n't take place on @entity4 's old blockbuster show , but on her little - watched cable channel . it 's part of a 90 - minute special airing thursday that could help @entity9 reclaim a bit of the limelight that faded when she gave up her throne as @entity21 's talk show queen to build her cable brand . it 's hardly surprising that @entity2 would choose the @entity4 route for dropping his decade of denials about doping . ( i instantly knew that what was he would do . you do n't go on @entity4 after being stripped of your championships and repeat the same old excuses . @entity34 reports that @entity2 will admit to using banned substances after his camp had floated the idea in a leak to the @entity39 . ) watch : does @entity4 have the cultural clout to revive @entity2 's career ? after all , she has been the go - to gal for famous folks in trouble . @entity44 talked about drug use with @entity4 . track star @entity46 talked with @entity4 about going to prison for lying about using banned substances . even author @entity49 , who touted on @entity4 an addiction memoir that turned out to have significant fabrications , went back on the show to submit to her castigation . when @entity4 was syndicated on @entity56 stations , her program was appointment viewing . how many people even know where the @entity59 is on their cable system ? @entity9 has acknowledged that she 's had a rough go in the cable world , which has included management turmoil , layoffs and the canceling of @entity68 's show . " i certainly did not expect the velocity of schadenfreude -- meaning people sort of lying in wait for you to fail , or make a mistake , " she has said . watch : was @entity75 and @entity77 's fight on @entity79 riveting or revolting ? what made @entity4 a powerful cultural force , beyond her ratings and big - name interviews and ability to sell books , was her prowess at image rehab . if @entity4 forgave you , could @entity21 be far behind ? so the stakes in the @entity2 encounter are considerable for her as well . but @entity2 is no ordinary celebrity who did something naughty that can be erased with a few well - timed tears . the man became an icon after battling back from cancer to reclaim his place as the world 's best bike racer . but then came the allegations from former teammates and others that @entity2 cheated , that he used performance - enhancing substances banned by racing authorities . watch : was @entity39 right in depicting @entity105 @entity104 as a boys ' club ? @entity2 denied these charges again and again . he lied to my colleague @entity109 , who produced a @entity112 cover story titled " @entity113 in @entity2 . " and he lied to me in two interviews . he was fervent and passionate , not just in saying he had never used banned substances but in accusing @entity21 anti-doping officials of conducting a " personal vendetta " against him . that was then ; this week is @entity4 . @entity2 's motivation is obvious . his career is in ruins . the @entity123 cancer charity he founded is struggling . he faces possible litigation . he wants to compete again and needs somehow to put this phase of his career behind him . but that is not so easy for athletes who cheat , as we were reminded by last week 's vote to exclude @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 from baseball 's @entity134 , based almost exclusively on alleged use of performance - enhancing drugs . watch : why are media swooning over @entity140 cover star @entity139 ? they never apologized ; perhaps @entity2 intends to do so . but if millions of people are n't watching him on @entity4 -- if most of the country just sees a 20 - second clip later -- does it have the same effect ? @entity4 might forgive @entity2 , clearing the way for others to do the same . or she might scold him , fostering a sense that he was publicly shamed for his conduct . either way , @entity9 will , for the first time in a long while , occupy center stage once again . for @entity2 , though , the spotlight might prove less flattering . join us on @entity158 / @entity157 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .	@entity21:U.S.	@entity158:Facebook	@entity113:I Still Believe	@entity112:Newsweek	@entity134:Hall of Fame	@entity157:CNNOpinion	@entity133:Roger Clemens	@entity132:Sammy Sosa	@entity2:Armstrong	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:Oprah	@entity131:Barry Bonds	@entity9:Oprah Winfrey	@entity79:MSNBC	@entity56:ABC	@entity75:Joe	@entity77:Mika	@entity34:USA Today	@entity39:New York Times	@entity104:White House	@entity105:Obama	@entity109:Buzz Bissinger	@entity123:Livestrong	@entity161:Kurtz	@entity140:Time	@entity44:Whitney Houston	@entity46:Marion Jones	@entity68:Rosie O'Donnell	@entity59:Oprah Winfrey Network	@entity139:Chris Christie	@entity49:James Frey

" they will have to be sent back , according to our law , " @entity1 's prime minister @entity13 told @entity2 . " they are entering the country illegally . we do what they would do . " the 12 boys and 66 men who arrived are among thousands of members of the @entity26 minority who have fled @entity5 , formerly known as @entity5 , because of persecution and in search of a better life . many of them make it across a dangerous sea crossing in crowded boats to @entity1 where they are housed in camps . but the @entity1 navy has been accused of forcing the boats back out to sea . the 78 people targeted for deportation are being held in @entity40 , in southern @entity1 . two remain in hospital and no date has been set for the forced repatriation , an immigration official said . but human rights groups are concerned about what will happen to the men and boys when they return . watch how crowded boats were towed out to sea and abandoned » " we know as a point of fact that there are @entity26 who 've been returned to @entity5 who have ended up in prison , " @entity51 , from @entity52 , said . " the @entity5 government has interviewed these 78 . our fear is that if these people are sent back , the government has a record of who they are , where their families are , " @entity51 said . " they may be tortured and or they could even be killed . that would n't be out of the question -- that is the real fear . " @entity71 , @entity1 - @entity5 researcher for @entity72 , said that the @entity26 had the " unenviable distinction of being the most blighted " people in @entity5 . " denied citizenship , subject to tight restrictions on movement , employment and religious freedoms , this @entity76 minority have been the target of abuses by the @entity5 military for decades , " he said . " today they face serious risks of state violence and coercion , in part arising from preparations to build a pipeline through their region that will deliver offshore gas to @entity95 . already reports are emerging of forced relocations and other abuses tied to gas exploitation . " the @entity5 government has not responded to @entity2 's request for an interview , but the plight of the @entity26 will be discussed at this weekend 's @entity104 summit of @entity106 nations , which the @entity5 prime minister and foreign minister are expected to attend . however , the man that effectively runs the country , senior general @entity109 , will not attend . @entity1 prime minister @entity13 has stressed the need for regional cooperation to help solve the problem of the thousands of @entity26 fleeing @entity5 . his government views them as economic migrants rather than political refugees and said it can not accommodate them in @entity1 . a recent @entity2 investigation found evidence that the @entity1 army was towing boatloads of @entity26 out to sea and cutting them adrift . hundreds are thought to have died as a result . @entity13 said the practice has stopped and insisted the @entity26 were given supplies of food and water .

" @placeholder 's " fourth - season finale airs sunday night	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- season four of " @entity2 " has featured some of the most brutal scenes in the popular series ' history . ( yes , that 's a warning for those behind on the show . @entity10 ahead ! ) there was the gut - wrenching death of @entity13 in the midseason finale , but there was also the burning death of @entity17 and @entity18 early on . it was a mystery who killed them , but it soon came out that @entity22 ( @entity23 ) did it to stop them from spreading a deadly disease through the prison . when @entity29 learned what happened , he banished @entity22 from the prison , but she reappeared in the second half of the season . young sisters @entity35 and @entity36 were left under @entity22 's care after their father died , but it became clear that @entity35 had a skewed sense of right and wrong , and she killed her younger sister to bring her back as a walker . then @entity22 decided yet again that another survivor was too dangerous to live and shot @entity35 in the back of the head . the reaction to this episode was huge . with @entity23 at the center of some of this season 's more memorable scenes , @entity0 spoke to her about @entity22 's evolution and the finale sunday night . @entity0 : what was your initial reaction when you learned what @entity22 was going to have to do this season ? @entity23 : it was surprising to me that @entity22 was going in this direction , absolutely . but it also made a great deal of sense to me that they would take her in this direction . first of all it 's a very interesting arc for this character , considering that she 's lost her daughter ; she carries so much responsibility for that , and also ( she 's ) trying to navigate this world . @entity0 : is this the most challenging acting role you 've ever had ? @entity23 : by far . this has been by far the most difficult , and certainly the longest - running . the most challenging and rewarding , for all the same reasons . @entity0 : there was a powerful response online to the deaths of @entity35 and @entity36 ; did you follow that reaction at all ? @entity23 : yeah , i was really happy about the responses that came from that episode . shooting that episode was remarkable and such a great experience . it all just came together in such a wonderful way . people talk about how " it needs to be earned . " i felt what was necessary in this episode was absolutely earned . the emotional and critical response has been wonderful . the fans have just been phenomenal in their appreciation for that episode . what ultimately happened in that episode was controversial , but i feel like it was handled with such a sensitive approach . the build - up to it was just handled so well . @entity0 : have you seen the memes that have cropped up about the scene ? the line " look at the flowers " has taken on a life of its own . @entity23 : people are pasting people 's faces over @entity35 's in the flower bed ! ( @entity112 ) that 's another thing i love about the fanbase : they have a great sense of humor . ... i 'm a spoofy kind of person . i appreciate the humor , and it 's a great way to offset the devastation that people on the show ( are ) going through -- it 's sometimes very refreshing to see that stuff . @entity0 : there 's a segment of fans who like the idea of @entity130 and @entity22 together . they have n't had too many scenes together this season , but is that something you might be pulling for ? @entity23 : i know that @entity22 and @entity130 have a tremendous bond . personally , i am living vicariously through the fans , i guess . i enjoy their passion . for some people , watching the show , it 's a fun element for them . they 're very passionate about their ' ships ! @entity0 : how do you react to the show 's massive popularity ? @entity23 : i 'm constantly amazed by the amount of different types of people that are aware of the show . after the episode with the girls , a gentleman who is 73 years old -- he said , " i 've never written a piece of fan mail ever , but i had to write how much i enjoyed that episode . " it touched me so much . when i think of how far - reaching this show is , and how big it is , it 's like trying to fathom the beginning of time , and i have to stop . @entity0 : what 's your favorite thing coming out of the show ? @entity23 : it certainly has to be the relationships within the cast and crew , and getting to work with the people i do . it 's so tremendously fulfilling , and personally getting to play this character has been a dream . @entity0 : what can fans expect from the season finale ? @entity23 : there 's nothing i can say that has n't already been said ! like every finale , ( whispers ) it 's gon na be crazy !	@entity17:David	@entity2:The Walking Dead	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Hershel	@entity10:Spoilers	@entity29:Rick	@entity23:Melissa McBride	@entity22:Carol	@entity18:Karen	@entity36:Mika	@entity112:Laughs	@entity35:Lizzie	@entity130:Daryl

@entity181 : thanks to @placeholder we can discover selective outrage	@entity171	( @entity0 ) -- not everyone will remember " @entity6 , " the 2006 movie that included a controversial scene in which president @entity4 was killed by a sniper . ( i , on the other hand , ca n't forget it because my @entity10 is an actress and had a big role in that movie ) . another thing i ca n't forget is the outrage that @entity15 sparked among some conservative commentators , including some of those very same people who are now defending @entity19 's film " @entity23 , " about the assassination of @entity22 leader @entity21 . " @entity6 " won an award at the prestigious @entity25 and was slated to play in several theater chains in @entity27 . that is , until some on the right went ballistic over it . @entity32 slammed the movie , reportedly calling the film 's director a " sicko " and saying the movie was part of an " age of insanity . " @entity42 ' @entity41 denounced the film in an article she penned for the conservative website , " @entity46 " titled , " @entity47 . " @entity48 used the word " shock " ( all in caps ) to describe the film on the front page of his @entity53 . and @entity54 grilled the film 's director on his @entity42 show with questions like " do you not have a responsibility to think of the impact , the impressions that could be made on people " by depicting the shooting of @entity4 ? the outrage was n't confined to the media . rep. @entity66 , then chairman of the @entity67 , dubbed the film disgusting , claimed it " could incite real violence " and reportedly warned that the filmmakers " would have blood on their hands if anything should ever happen . " @entity66 went on to call for no movie theater or tv network in @entity27 to show the film : " any theater that would show this , any tv station that would show this , is acting irresponsibly . it would be a disgrace for it to be shown anywhere . " in response to this outrage , the film was indeed pulled from the big theater chains and relegated to a handful of art house theaters . as a then - spokesperson for @entity91 , one of the movie theater chains that caved into the pressure , reportedly stated , " we do not feel it is appropriate to portray the future assassination of a president , therefore we do not intend to program this film at any of our cinemas . " yet fast forward to 2014 , and @entity53 reads , " surrender : @entity19 pulls ' interview . " ( apparently @entity48 's computer is stuck in " caps lock " mode . ) @entity41 's @entity106 feed , meanwhile , is filled with retweets that denounce @entity19 's puling of the film . but the award for the biggest flip - flopper of them all goes to @entity66 . the man who in 2006 called for theaters to not screen the film that portrayed @entity4 being assassinated sang a far different tune when interviewed earlier this week by @entity0 's @entity116 . when @entity116 asked @entity66 if it was appropriate for a film to depict a world leader being assassinated , @entity66 responded , " there 's no reason not to do it . " @entity66 went on to state -- as if he had no recollection of what he said in 2006 -- that there have " been terrible things said about our presidents and our leaders in movies . ... this is something that , in a free society , we tolerate . " look , if you are going to credibly defend freedom of expression , it requires that you be consistent . you ca n't just defend the words or images you agree with . that 's not how freedom of expression works . and deep down , i know that @entity66 and the pundits on the right know this . but too often they are playing to their political base or the consumers of their media outlets at the expense of intellectual honesty . ( and to be candid , some on the left are just as guilty , though typically not in the area of freedom of expression . ) will the future bring any changes ? tough to say , although to be honest it seems unlikely . it 's how some of them remain in office and attract fans to their websites and tv shows . but thanks to a thing called @entity171 we can discover in a matter of minutes the selective outrage and outright hypocrisy of these people . at least then we can dismiss their words as being nothing more than hollow pandering .	@entity22:North Korean	@entity23:The Interview	@entity21:Kim Jong Un	@entity27:America	@entity25:Toronto Film Festival	@entity116:Blitzer	@entity171:Google	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Death of a President	@entity4:Bush	@entity53:The Drudge Report	@entity54:Sean Hannity	@entity15:DOAP	@entity32:Rush Limbaugh	@entity10:fiancÃ ©	@entity19:Sony	@entity106:Twitter	@entity91:Regal Entertainment Group	@entity181:Obeidallah	@entity46:Town Hall	@entity47:Kill Bush Mania	@entity41:Malkin	@entity42:Fox News	@entity66:King	@entity67:House Homeland Security Committee	@entity48:Drudge

@placeholder : " i 'm a private man , and i 'm a gentleman . and i 'm proud of it . "	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity2 that when he first got into show business , he had " no eyes to be a performer . i had no ambition to be on the stage singing , singing and dancing around the stage . " @entity1 , who has sold over 80 million records worldwide , had 35 consecutive top 40 hits and five albums simultaneously on the charts , is the guest on thursday 's " @entity16 . " the show was taped before a rare in - studio audience , and the renowned singer - songwriter played the piano and sang some of his hits . " when i got up there to promote my first album , " said @entity1 , " i really did n't know what to do with my legs . i was able to get up from the piano , and then i really did n't know what else to do , because i had never , ever thought about standing up on a stage and entertaining . and , i thought i was dreadful . but the audiences did n't . and i think they were able to connect with a guy who was telling the truth . " @entity1 recalled that his first real shot at the spotlight was given to him by @entity35 in the early 1970s . " i was her conductor and arranger , " said @entity1 . " and i had an album out . and she allowed me to do a couple of songs . " during the 1960s and 1970s , @entity1 worked as a commercial jingle writer . he composed the songs for @entity45 ( " and like a good neighbor , @entity45 is there ... " ) , @entity46 ( " i am stuck on @entity46 , ' cause @entity46 's stick on me ! " ) and @entity47 's ( " you deserve a break today " ) among others . @entity1 pointed out that the @entity45 and @entity46 jingles still air to this day . the @entity56 - born - and - raised @entity1 recalled that on the day he was presented with his first $ 1 million check , which he calls " the ' @entity58 , " he had actually bounced a check he 'd written out to @entity60 that same morning . " @entity62 , " which was recorded in 1974 , was @entity1 's first no. 1 hit . " i used it as a bookmark , " said @entity1 . " i mean , that 's where i was at , you know . i did n't take money seriously . i was never doing it for the money . " @entity1 also recounted the lashing he got from critics who bashed " @entity62 , " despite the song 's success on the charts . " i 've got my feelings on my sleeve , " said @entity1 . " i 've made a career out of it , you know ? this is who i am , this is what i feel and i think that was one of the reasons i had such trouble with the critics . they did n't like to see that from a guy . they 'd much rather see a guy being angry on the stage . " @entity1 's first album of original songs in more than a decade , " @entity99 , " is out . the singer - songwriter has been the resident headliner at the @entity102 in @entity103 for two years ; prior to that he headlined at the @entity105 for five years . now in his seventh year in @entity103 , @entity1 may soon beat @entity107 's record of @entity103 longevity . the album name is a nod to the expression coined by artist @entity112 in 1968 : " in the future , everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes . " @entity1 , who has been world - famous for nearly 40 years , told @entity2 that the rewards of fame depend on how it is handled . @entity1 said that he fears for people who become famous on shows such as " @entity121 " and " @entity122 " without having paid their dues . " they do have talent , " @entity1 said . " but , you know , before you know it , they are household names . and they have n't worked in the bars that we worked in . they have n't played the bar mitzvah , they have n't gotten dressed in the men 's room . " however , @entity1 pointed out there 's a dark side to fame today and that stars often pay a price that he did n't have to pay . in particular , he referenced @entity143 ' psychological issues and troubles with paparazzi and said , " i do n't know whether anybody brings that kind of thing on themselves . it seems to me that she was trying to live her life . " this did n't happen to me . not that . they did n't follow me around wherever i was going . " he said he worries about young celebrities today because " just being famous is a very dangerous thing to do if you are not grounded . " @entity1 also pointed out that celebrities today open their private lives to the public via @entity159 , @entity160 and reality shows , saying " they invite people in , you know . for me , that 's one place i lock the door unless i invite you in . it 's my one thing that i finally have to myself , man . which is my life and you ca n't come in unless i invite you in . " @entity2 told @entity1 that he agrees that " we know too much " about famous people 's lives , and that he finds the musician more interesting because he keeps his private life private , invoking " the old mystique from celebrity . " @entity1 recalled coming up in " that world of @entity180 's " where " we did n't see then what we do see now . " i 'm a private man , and i 'm a gentleman , " said @entity1 . " and i 'm proud of it . " when @entity2 asked @entity1 to tell the now - famous story of how @entity185 publicly came to his defense , @entity1 said , " he said some really great things when i was out at dinner and he gave me a real compliment . he said , ' keep doing what you 're doing , man . ' and those were the years that i really needed to hear that . " what 's @entity1 's favorite @entity1 song ? " there 's so many songs , " @entity1 said . " there 's been 30 years of music , but ' @entity202 ' comes to mind . " @entity1 said the song remains an inspiration to him because the words and music came to him in a dream one night . he would n't disclose his least favorite @entity1 song . how did @entity1 feel about being " the greatest showman of our generation " by @entity211 magazine ?

the @placeholder says @entity3 players were offered extra money to hurt opposing players	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 announced monday it will not overturn the penalty it previously imposed against the @entity3 and members of its coaching staff for the team 's bounty program . @entity1 commissioner @entity8 did not alter the lengths of the suspensions he had levied last month . but he left open the possibility that fine amounts could be reduced and a draft pick could be restored if the team and its coaching staff " embrace the opportunity " to help develop and implement player safety programs . the unprecedented punishment was handed down in march after an @entity1 investigation found the team had an " active bounty program " during the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 seasons . during this time , players were purportedly offered " bounty " payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game . the @entity1 found evidence that bounties were put on quarterbacks @entity31 of the @entity32 , @entity33 of the @entity34 , @entity35 of the @entity36 and @entity37 of the @entity38 . the stiffest penalty that the @entity1 handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to @entity41 , the @entity3 defensive coordinator who , in this past offseason , moved over to take that same position with the @entity44 . head coach @entity47 suspension for the entire 2012 - 2013 season will begin april 16 , the league said monday . general manager @entity49 was suspended without pay for that season 's first eight regular - season games , and assistant head coach @entity53 was suspended without pay for the first six regular - season games . their suspensions will begin at the end of the preseason , according to monday 's @entity1 statement . " at the conclusion of their suspensions , the commissioner will review the status of each of the three individuals to determine their eligibility for reinstatement , " the league said , referring to @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity53 . the team was also fined $ 500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second - round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 , the @entity1 has said . the league added monday that it may consider " modifying the forfeiture " of the 2013 draft pick , assuming other conditions are met . @entity8 has said he 's also considering imposing penalties against players involved in the bounty program , but he has n't given a timetable and has insisted he 'll first consult with the @entity80 before doing so . in its ruling , the @entity1 singled out @entity47 -- who led the @entity3 to its first ever @entity83 victory in february 2010 , after a season in which the bounty program was in place -- by saying that violations for the bounty program " were compounded by the failure of coach @entity47 to supervise the players and coaches . " the league said that @entity47 did n't look further into the " pay - for - performance / bounty program " despite the @entity1 's inquiries about it in 2010 and 2012 , " falsely ( denied ) that the program existed " and encouraged " the false denials by instructing assistants to ' make sure our ducks are in a row . ' " in public remarks , @entity47 has not admitted he lied to the @entity1 and insisted that no one was injured as a result of the bounty program . but he did say in late march , shortly after his suspension was announced , that he was " disappointed " in himself and regretted not being more involved in the team 's defense . " as the head coach , anything that happens within the framework of your team and your program you 're responsible for . and that 's a lesson i 've learned , " he said .	@entity3:Saints	@entity31:Brett Favre	@entity1:NFL	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Aaron Rodgers	@entity34:Carolina Panthers	@entity37:Kurt Warner	@entity36:Green Bay Packers	@entity38:Arizona Cardinals	@entity8:Goodell	@entity33:Cam Newton	@entity80:NFL Players Association	@entity44:St. Louis Rams	@entity49:Loomis	@entity53:Vitt	@entity32:Minnesota Vikings	@entity41:Gregg Williams	@entity47:Payton	@entity83:Super Bowl	@entity123:GM
composer hailed as the " @entity1 @placeholder " for writing hit symphonies despite deafness	@entity9	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- a once - celebrated @entity1 composer who last week confessed his works were written by a ghostwriter , and subsequently had doubt cast on his claim to be deaf , now admits at least partially faking his hearing loss . @entity8 , until recently hailed as a " @entity1 beethoven " for composing hit symphonies despite claiming to have been completely deaf for 15 years , made the admission in a handwritten apology sent to news organizations through his lawyers . " i apologize from the bottom of my heart for betraying and hurting many people , " he wrote , in his first public statement addressing the allegations about his hearing . in a televised press conference last week , a @entity0 music teacher named @entity23 revealed that he had secretly been the real composer of @entity8 's works for 18 years . he also expressed doubt over the composer 's claims of deafness -- central to his romantic public image as a genius who " felt " music he could not hear -- saying that @entity8 had conversed with him normally , and provided critiques on the music he contracted him to write over the years . " i 've never felt he was deaf ever since we met , " he said . read more : uproar as ' @entity1 @entity9 ' exposed as fraud in his written statement , @entity8 , who is yet to publicly front over the scandal , said that he had been deaf , but in the past three years had recovered a degree of hearing . " it has recovered to an extent where i could sometimes grasp words when someone speaks clearly and slowly close to my ears , though it sounds muffled and skewed , " he wrote . stating that he planned to apologize to the public in person soon , @entity8 added that he was prepared to have his hearing medically tested , and would forfeit his government - issued disability certificate if found ineligible . the eight - page letter also contained apologies to tsunami victims , for whom his most famous symphony had become an important symbol of resilience , and to @entity1 @entity64 figure skater @entity63 , who planned to perform to another ghostwritten work in @entity66 . @entity63 takes to the ice thursday , and the @entity68 has said that while the score will be used , the composer 's name will be omitted from the program . " i am deeply ashamed of living a life of lies , " said @entity8 's statement . @entity8 claimed to rely on his perfect pitch to compose his hit symphonies , movie scores and video game soundtracks after losing his hearing , telling @entity80 in a 2001 interview that " if you trust your inner sense of sound , you create something that is truer ... losing my hearing was a gift from @entity88 .

( of course , @entity10 ' appearance in the final moments of the season finale certainly suggested that @entity9 's story was not complete , but why let that get in the way of wild speculation ? ) well , worry no more ! in an interview with tv line , @entity37 creator @entity37 makes clear that @entity9 , and @entity10 , still have a future on the series . " when people leave @entity4 , sometimes it is the end for [ the character ] , " @entity37 said . " but i will spoil that one tiny piece of anticipation and tell people that @entity10 will be showing up to work . " @entity37 was n't kidding , though , when he said he 'd only spoil a tiny bit . he declined to illuminate how much @entity10 will be appearing in the show 's sixth season , let alone in what capacity she would be on the show . ( he was clear , though , that the show will have a sixth and seventh season . ) so for now , we 'll just have to let our own fertile imaginations conjure up where @entity9 's upward mobility could take her . see full story at @entity0 . click here to try 2 risk free issues of @entity0 © 2011 @entity0 and @entity64 all rights reserved .	@entity16:Don Draper	@entity0:Entertainment Weekly	@entity26:Emmy	@entity37:Matthew Weiner	@entity11:Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce	@entity10:Moss	@entity9:Peggy	@entity4:Mad Men	@entity64:Time Inc.

president @entity11 is briefed on the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in @placeholder	@entity3	the @entity0 is offering its help , but making clear that the @entity3 government must take the lead in finding more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the @entity7 militant group @entity6 . officials told @entity9 the @entity11 administration is sharing intelligence with @entity3 authorities and could provide other assistance , but there is no planning to send @entity0 troops . with a @entity19 gathering set to begin wednesday in @entity20 , the @entity3 government came under mounting pressure to save the girls abducted in the country 's remote northeast and threatened with being sold into slavery . on a trip to @entity28 , secretary of state @entity26 said the @entity0 " will do everything possible to support the @entity3 government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice . " in @entity35 , @entity0 officials offered few specific details on @entity0 help being provided . " we are going to keep working with the @entity3 privately on that , " @entity39 spokeswoman @entity38 told reporters . " obviously they have come out very publicly and said that they are , you know , making every effort to find these girls . i just do n't think we are going to outline how we are helping them . what we are focused on is making sure they can find ( the girls ) and bring them home to their families . " no @entity0 troops @entity38 noted that @entity53 , the undersecretary of state for civilian security , democracy and human rights , would be traveling to @entity3 in coming days . asked if she anticipated @entity0 troops or other assets getting sent to @entity3 , @entity38 replied : " i do not . " @entity59 spokesman @entity58 said president @entity11 has been briefed on the situation a few times . @entity58 also listed a series of @entity0 programs and steps in @entity3 , most predating the latest kidnappings , intended to strengthen its criminal justice system , improve its ability to combat improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) and expand economic opportunity for women . " there are other things , i am sure ... but this is an outrage and a tragedy and we are doing what we can to assist the @entity3 government to support its efforts to find and free the young women who were abducted , " he said . according to two senior @entity0 officials , @entity3 authorities so far have not asked for specific help in any kind of possible joint rescue mission . one of the officials said the @entity3 privately indicated they want to handle the situation themselves , perhaps because they do n't want visible @entity0 forces in their country . " we are sharing intelligence that may be relevant to this situation , " said another @entity0 official with direct knowledge of the situation , speaking on condition of not being identified due to the sensitive nature of the information . " you are going to see a focus on this in all three channels of government : diplomatic , intelligence and military . " sharing intelligence the @entity0 could offer satellite imagery and electronic intelligence such as communications intercepts in the effort to rescue the kidnapped girls . another @entity0 official said the @entity0 military is not planning to send troops , but could consider helping @entity3 forces with any planning for a rescue mission , under existing military cooperation agreements . @entity117 has long been helping @entity3 forces improve their training and operations to counter @entity6 militants . last week , the @entity39 's annual report on global terrorism described @entity6 as a group that " espouses a violent @entity125 extremist ideology " and has received funding from @entity127 in the @entity128 . the @entity0 designated @entity6 a terrorist organization last november , said the report , which blamed the group for attacks in northern and northeastern @entity3 that have killed thousands of people since 2009 . among the most notorious attacks by @entity6 were a 2011 bombing at a @entity137 building in @entity20 that killed more than 20 people , and a wave of bombings in @entity141 , @entity3 , in 2012 that killed 180 people in one day , the @entity39 report said . the group also has freed prisoners and killed students and soldiers in other attacks , and kidnapped @entity148 citizens in neighboring @entity149 , according to the report . link to @entity127 affiliates @entity6 " receives the bulk of its funding from bank robberies and related criminal activities , including extortion and kidnapping for ransoms , " as well as the @entity127 in the @entity128 funding , the report added . according to @entity0 authorities , @entity6 has gotten training in weapons and communications from @entity166 as well as @entity167 . last week , attorney general @entity169 asked @entity0 intelligence agencies to prepare a report for him on the latest schoolgirl kidnappings in @entity3 , an @entity0 law enforcement official told @entity9 . the attorney general also requested an assessment of @entity6 that could help the @entity174 seek indictments or curtail funding sources for the group . the name @entity6 means " @entity180 education is sin , " and a video made public monday showed a man claiming to be @entity6 leader @entity184 saying the kidnapped girls should get married instead of going to school . " i abducted your girls . i will sell them in the market , by @entity195 , " the man says in the video first obtained by @entity192 . selling humans " there is a market for selling humans . @entity195 says i should sell . he commands me to sell . i will sell women . i sell women , " he continues , according to a @entity9 translation from the local @entity204 language . according to accounts , armed members of @entity6 overwhelmed security guards at a school in northeastern @entity209 , pulled the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks . the convoy then disappeared into a forest bordering @entity149 . the total number kidnapped was 276 , according to @entity3 authorities . at least 53 escaped , leaving 223 missing , police said . @entity3 president @entity218 said sunday that his government would free the girls . in @entity35 , a group of @entity0 senators from both parties has introduced a resolution condemning the kidnappings and calling for the @entity0 to help the @entity3 government improve school security and go after @entity6 . the resolution stops short of calling for sending @entity0 troops , instead urging " timely civilian assistance " from the @entity0 and allied @entity28 nations to help rescue the abducted girls .

@entity4 seizes on @placeholder ruling to attack @entity7 for raising taxes	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- taxes took center stage in renewed @entity4 attacks on the @entity7 administration 's sweeping health care legislation thursday after the @entity8 rebuffed attempts to derail it based on its constitutionality . using the court 's finding that the centerpiece of the law -- the individual mandate -- amounted to a legal exercise of congressional tax power became @entity20 for the @entity4 . " that 's not what the president said when he introduced the bill , but what the court said was that it 's ok because it 's a tax , " @entity22 rep. @entity21 , @entity23 , told @entity0 . " the debate that we 're happy to have is that our friends on the other side of the aisle [ not only ] want to tax what you do , they want to tax even what you do n't do . " ruling , tax fears play into campaign narrative for both sides and @entity44 @entity43 sen. @entity43 said , " millions of @entity22 may now have a @entity46 problem as a result of the ruling . " but @entity49 , a leading chronicler of the battle over health care , says that should n't be a surprise . the requirement that all adults have health coverage is the linchpin of the @entity59 , the health care legislation president @entity7 signed in 2010 after an epic brawl in @entity61 . that rule survived its last legal challenge thursday when the @entity8 ruled it was constitutional under the legislative branch 's power to impose taxes . @entity7 had denied the mandate was a tax during a 2009 interview with @entity70 , comparing it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance . " nobody considers that a tax increase . people say to themselves , ' that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car , that i 'm not covering all the costs . ' " what health reform could cost you at least four million people are expected to pay a tax penalty when the rule takes full effect in 2016 , bringing in about $ 54 billion to help offset the $ 1.7 trillion , 10 - year cost of the act , according to the nonpartisan @entity89 . but it 's only one of several revenue - raising provisions that help pay for the costs of the act , commonly dubbed " @entity59 . " " this was the @entity101 tax bill , " said @entity49 , a @entity96 political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle . in addition to the mandate , there is a higher @entity106 tax rate on taxpayers making more than $ 200,000 a year or $ 250,000 for married couples , and it added a tax on investment income to fund the federal health program for seniors . opinion : @entity8 's ruling a ' @entity115 ' " it 's one of those invisible things , and it 's very important , " @entity49 said . there 's also an excise tax on so - called " @entity123 " health plans , which had been hotly debated at the time ; a higher threshold on medical deductions ; and a 10 % excise tax on indoor tanning services . but while @entity4 have long opposed higher taxes , @entity49 said they concentrated their fire on the mandate instead . " rather than getting into a convoluted conversation about taxes that were pretty obscure to most people , they latched onto the individual mandate , " he said . " now that the @entity8 has up held the mandate , it 's really kind of taken the wind out of their sails . " @entity49 said most @entity22 will be covered by employee health plans , a head of household 's employer or by existing government programs such as @entity106 , @entity143 or veterans ' benefits . of the roughly 6 % of the population remaining , a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate either because of poverty , religious belief or other reasons , he said . by the numbers : health insurance @entity8 on health care law : how they voted , what they wrote photos : who is @entity161 ? @entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .	@entity22:Americans	@entity23:R-Georgia	@entity20:Plan B	@entity21:Tom Price	@entity115:Frankenstein 's Monster	@entity89:Congressional Budget Office	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Obama	@entity4:GOP	@entity8:Supreme Court	@entity59:Obamacare	@entity70:ABC	@entity101:Democratic	@entity106:Medicare	@entity96:University of Minnesota	@entity123:Cadillac	@entity162:Matt Smith	@entity161:John Roberts	@entity143:Medicaid	@entity44:Florida	@entity46:IRS	@entity43:Marco Rubio	@entity49:Jacobs	@entity61:Congress
the two spoke in october at the @entity62 conference in @placeholder , @entity64	@entity63	( @entity0 ) -- it does n't sound like it should be that hard . the challenge : design an aircraft that , powered only by a human , can reach 3 meters ( 9.84 feet ) in altitude and hover for at least 60 seconds . and yet that dare , first issued in 1980 , stymied the world 's best flight engineers . dozens of teams tried . only a handful managed to get their " human helicopter " off the ground . none won the elusive $ 250,000 @entity15 , established by the @entity16 for the first team to accomplish the feat. until this year . thirty - three years after the @entity15 was established , a @entity20 team led by @entity21 and @entity22 claimed it in june with a 64 - second flight in an indoor athletic arena outside @entity25 . while @entity22 tracked their progress from the field below , @entity21 powered their delicate aircraft by pedaling a bicycle - like apparatus that twirled four enormous rotors . 11 @entity34 projects that raised $ 1m or more their achievement was the second flight milestone for @entity21 and @entity22 , who are becoming pioneers in the small but emerging field of human - powered aviation . three years ago the pair built perhaps the first flapping - wing aircraft , powered by a human , to sustain flight . all of which raises a logical question : why do these things ? what 's the point of designing aircraft that hardly anybody will ever fly ? " there 's not ... practicality to a lot of what we do , " admitted @entity22 . " you wo n't be flying your human - powered flapping - wing airplane or your human - powered helicopter to work . " but all of our projects challenge people 's conventional way of thinking , " he told @entity0 at the recent @entity62 conference in @entity63 , @entity64 , where he and @entity21 were cheered for their innovative approach to problem - solving . " we really want people to understand that impossible is nothing , " he added . " and just because someone says you ca n't do something , does n't mean you ( ca n't ) . with the application of passion and persistence and innovative , creative thinking , you can really take on any challenge . " photos : the @entity85 take flight modern - day @entity87 @entity89 sketched plans for the first human - powered , flapping - wing aircraft , known as an ornithopter , more than 500 years ago . since then , of course , a fixed - wing design has become the standard for airplanes . but that has n't stopped aerospace engineers from trying make a variety of ornithopters fly . @entity21 and @entity22 , graduates of the @entity103 , launched their ornithopter project in 2006 and began flight testing their aircraft , the @entity107 , three years later . the plane had a wingspan of 105 feet -- comparable to that of a @entity111 -- but weighed only 94 pounds . a car towed the plane into the air to get it started , while @entity21 sat in a small cockpit and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system that flapped the wings up and down . with every failed test flight -- which broke more than a few planes -- the two engineers learned a little more . " basically , with these aircraft , the mantra is , ' you do n't fly any higher than you 're willing to fall . ' and that tends to keep you fairly safe , " @entity21 said . " we 've had some crashes , but no real injuries . " unusual energy sources of the future finally , in august 2010 , in a suburban @entity25 field , @entity107 was able to sustain altitude and airspeed for 19.3 seconds while covering a distance of about 475 feet . @entity21 , @entity22 and their team believe the brief flight set a world record for an aircraft of its kind . then came the human - powered helicopter . the team built the aircraft , dubbed @entity147 , in three months , but it took another nine months of crash - filled flight testing before they hit their target . " whenever we had a big crash , it was devastating . it took so much of our time to piece @entity157 back together again . the whole helicopter is built sort of like a house of cards -- if one thing goes , the entire thing falls apart , " @entity22 said . " but every time we picked ourselves back up ( after a crash ) , we would know a little bit more than last time . " innovative shelter pods help the homeless through winter a land speed record in 2012 , @entity21 and @entity22 established @entity167 , a company dedicated to seeking sustainable enginering and design solutions to technological challenges by using human - powered vehicles as a teaching platform . now the two young engineers have their sights on another big goal : setting a land speed record for the fastest human - powered bicycle . in september , they went to @entity179 , @entity180 , for the @entity181 , where teams compete on flat desert roads to race aerodynamic bicycles as fast as cars . pedaled by @entity21 , their entry @entity188 -- a recumbent bike encased in a sleek carbon - fiber shell -- reached speeds of 77 mph on flat ground . " the fact that a human engine -- about the equivalent power of an electric motor the size of your fist -- can power a bicycle at the same speed as that of a car , which has a hundred times or more the power , is really the innovative and inspiring thing that we think people should understand , " @entity22 said . malls of the future @entity21 and @entity22 plan to return to @entity179 next year with a faster bike and take aim at the world speed record of 83.8 mph , set this fall by a @entity215 team . unlike the ornithopter and the helicopter , a human - powered , high - speed bike might actually have a future as a practical mode of personal transportation . but even if it does n't , @entity21 and @entity22 will keep pushing against the boundaries of what humans can achieve . the two young @entity20 believe their biggest contribution to flight and speed engineering may be to inspire others to tackle what seems insurmountable . " it 's very easy to say something 's impossible , " @entity21 said . " it 's much more difficult to change your assumptions , and change your context , to make something possible .

" at @entity11 the " battle of testosterone " will be very much in evidence when golf 's oldest major tees off on thursday and no - one watching the prestigious tournament will be particularly troubled by this primeval male instinct . but when the @entity13 is awarded to @entity11 -- one of three clubs along with @entity70 's and @entity71 on the @entity13 rotation which still operate men - only membership policies -- there is always intense criticism . @entity22 's first minister @entity76 has publicly pronounced his disapproval of the male - only policy by effectively boycotting the event . there is a view that holding a global tournament at a club which does not accept female members vindicates @entity86 values of patriarchy and keeps women in their place . but @entity90 does not necessarily agree -- instead she argues that male - only or female - only policies represent an expression of freedom , not constraint . " if what people are trying to say is that it is putting women down because they are n't allowed to join , i do n't think that 's the issue , " @entity90 said . " if men want to have their own club by all means have their own club , if women want to similarly . " if some men choose to play golf only with men that is absolutely fine . no - one is forcing anyone to go to an all - male club . " when @entity18 opened there was just one comment right at the beginning when a journalist said this was anti-feminist . " i think the point that they were trying to make is that women have striven for hundreds of years to have equality and someone is going backwards by having a women 's only club but i just could n't understand that argument . " for me , this is really liberating and really being independent of thought , saying no , we want our space because there are lots of issues we want to take up . " golf economics nestled at the back of the19th @entity132 of @entity133 is a parkland golf course , home to the @entity136 -- which claims to be the oldest female - only golf club in the world and the only one in @entity22 . the club was established in 1891 as a separate entity from the nearby men 's club and is now run solely by women as a picturesque place for a game of nine holes . men can play on the ladies ' course but only women can become members . " it 's a nice welcoming environment for ladies getting into golf , " club captain @entity152 told @entity0 . " we have beautiful views up to the north . " but with a dwindling number of local ladies that play golf , @entity159 concedes that it might be difficult to survive as a single - gender club . " a lot of our members are quite elderly , " @entity159 explained . " it 's the way that things are now . young women are working and working longer . that 's a bit of a downside . " most clubs are just a ladies section in a mixed club so it does mean there are considerable extra responsibilities such as staff , ground maintenance , starters and two greenkeepers . " financially it 's becoming more difficult as time goes on as we do n't have the numbers . the older ladies here will talk about when they used to come up to pay to play on the course in the summer holidays . " people used to be desperate to play and queue up but we 're not in that favorable position now . " we are finding it harder to make ends meet and the longevity of the club probably is not too rosy . " just up the road at the @entity133 men 's club -- where a weekday round costs $ 120 -- the scenario could not be more different . " there is no comparison with our wealth and the wealth that is in the men 's club , " @entity159 added . " they still have a waiting list for membership . they are in a very fortunate position financially . " the ladies ' club might just be sustainable if we have a closer relationship with the men 's club . " in fact , @entity159 argues that closer relationships between men and women in the game of golf -- and beyond -- could be the solution to the furore over the female - ban at @entity11 . " we may all have to give in to the point where all clubs are mixed , " she said . " it 's the way things are going in society and in sports . " i do n't see that sports clubs have any reason to be any different . it 's just equality in all things . " in time , what we 're doing just now will look pretty archaic to future generations when they see that certain people were excluded from certain golf clubs . " historic hangover @entity242 , chief executive of the @entity243 , which organizes the @entity13 , argues that the single - sex policy of @entity11 -- and others -- is a historic hangover . " single sex clubs are still something of a feature in @entity22 , " @entity242 told @entity0 . " it 's a historical thing actually because women came to the game of golf when men were already established . " it 's something that is reported as an issue far more than the actuality of it . we have a situation where about 1 % of clubs in the @entity20 are single sex - it 's a very small number . " @entity263 has moved on from the stereotypes of 50 years ago . it is chalk and cheese and we 'll just have to wait and see what happens in the year ahead . " in @entity272 in the south of @entity271 there is already a positive example of a single - gender club that has happily merged into mixed living . the @entity276 -- which can count the late queen mother as its club captain in the 1932 -- was established in 1902 as a place for women to play the game . it took more than a century for men to be admitted as members -- but club secretary @entity285 says the advantages of mixed membership are self evident . good mixers " there are ladies out there who do not want to join a ladies - only club , " @entity285 told @entity0 . " then there are other people who might feel intimidated by a male - dominated environment . here those people might feel less intimidated . " society is mixed so there is no reason for this club not to be . the best friends i 've made , i 've made playing golf . " i play golf here with my wife very happily and afterwards we have a damn good sunday lunch in the clubhouse . " whether it is tee for two or tea for two , the concept is one that @entity90 is also happy to endorse , even within the walls of female oasis @entity40 . " invariably in the evening , our members invite male partners in for drinks or an event or lectures , " @entity90 explained . " a lot of women love the fact that they have their own space during the day but it 's nice to have a mix of things . " it 's fine to invite the opposite sex in as guests -- it 's quite civilized as men and women do sit @entity331 -- but if the core of the club is also about single - sex , that 's fine too . " and if golf 's global organizers wanted to make a stand for equality they could always hold the men 's @entity13 at a ladies - only golf club . would n't that equal things out ? " @entity13 , held at a ladies club ? " @entity159 ponders incredulously . " it will never happen .

@placeholder wants @entity6 to say he has a jobs program that will raise the miminum wage	@entity181	( @entity0 ) -- forget @entity1 . there 's a new @entity4 application that provides hours of entertainment . released last week , @entity6 allows you to type in any phrase you want and the president 's voice will repeat it back to you . i played around with the app and could n't help but have some ego - stroking fun : " @entity14 , what an honor to meet you . i love your work . " no matter what you think of @entity6 's performance lately , you ca n't help but enjoy the president 's thoughtful baritone speaking directly to you and saying exactly what you want to hear . with so many pundits and politicians weighing in on what @entity6 should be saying about how to get our country back on track , this should be a popular application . even though the president ca n't seem to find his fighting words of 2008 , you can visit the @entity33 for a free download that will deliver you back to the days when @entity6 fought for @entity35 . if i could have the president say anything , i 'd have him say what a growing chorus of commentators have been urging for months now , something like , " our no. 1 priority is jobs , and i have a bold , detailed plan to rebuild our schools and infrastructure , revive manufacturing and spur our nation 's green industrial revolution . " let 's hope @entity6 will lay out this big vision for job creation in his @entity53 speech , going further than his small bore approach of late . and while i 'm putting words in his mouth , i 'd also have @entity6 say , " it 's time to raise the minimum wage . " it may sound surprising , but it 's exactly what our economy needs . on the campaign trail , @entity6 called for raising the minimum wage to $ 9.50 by 2011 ; now is the time deliver on that pledge . raising the minimum wage would not only help working families , it also would help power the economic recovery . as the economy has sputtered , wages have stagnated , and even folks with jobs are having trouble meeting their families ' basic needs . accounting for inflation , weekly wages have actually fallen by 1.3 percent in the past eight months , and the @entity80 reported that consumer spending , which makes up 70 percent of the economy , dropped in june for the first time in nearly two years -- both deeply worrying economic indicators . raising the minimum wage puts a little more money in pockets of the lowest - paid workers , who have little choice but to spend that additional income immediately , helping restore the consumer spending that businesses need to grow . preliminary estimates suggest that restoring the minimum wage to $ 10 per hour by 2014 could generate as many as 160,000 new jobs . and not only does raising the wage floor help workers making minimum wage , it also boosts pay scales across the whole lower end of our economy . unfortunately , low - wage work is becoming the livelihood of an ever - growing number of workers . a new analysis by the @entity108 finds that while the majority of jobs lost during and after the recession were in mid-wage occupations , roughly three - quarters of jobs added since job growth resumed are low - wage . and while the bastion of low - paid workers is growing , their wages are declining : workers in lower - wage occupations ( with median wages under $ 13.52 ) have seen a 2.3 percent decline in real wages since the recession began . while wages and salaries are now the lowest share of gdp since 1955 , corporate profits are the largest share of gdp since 1950 . according to research by @entity133 at @entity134 , wages and salaries accounted for just 1 percent of economic growth in the first 18 months after the recession ended , while corporate profits accounted for an unprecedented 88 percent of economic growth . put quite simply , working people have been getting the shaft . not only would a new push to raise the minimum wage help @entity144 's economy and working families -- it would help @entity6 regain populist momentum . raising the minimum wage is particularly popular with the public , consistently winning support from more than two - thirds of the public . opponents are likely to be put on the defensive , struggling to explain why they oppose a modest raise for @entity35 as @entity155 enjoys record profits . they will also resurrect the tired old canard that raising the minimum wage leads to job loss , but that theory was first shot to pieces in the 1990s by @entity163 , @entity6 's nominee to head the @entity164 , when he and economist @entity165 published a groundbreaking study finding that raising the minimum wage boosts incomes of low - paid workers without reducing employment . nearly two decades of rigorous academic research has confirmed these findings . with so many @entity144 struggling , we need the president to raise his voice and find some fighting words . it 's time for president @entity6 to say -- once again -- that now is the time to raise the minimum wage . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .	@entity144:Americans	@entity163:Alan Krueger	@entity33:iTunes store	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Main Street	@entity6:Obama	@entity164:Council of Economic Advisers	@entity4:iPhone	@entity181:Thompson	@entity165:David Card	@entity1:Angry Birds	@entity80:Commerce Department	@entity53:post-Labor Day	@entity14:Anne	@entity133:Andrew Sum	@entity108:National Employment Law Project	@entity134:Northeastern University	@entity155:Wall Street
" @placeholder " earned an estimated $ 29.3 million	@entity4	@entity0 wins again ! @entity5 's " @entity4 , " a technologically enhanced re-release of the 1994 animated classic , tore up the competition at the box office this weekend , earning an estimated $ 29.3 million -- more than the other three newcomers combined . in " @entity4 's " original theatrical run , it roared up a stunning $ 312.9 million total , becoming the highest - grossing animated film in box office history at that time . the film earned another $ 15.7 million during a 2002 @entity15 re-release , and now another $ 29.3 million during the first weekend of its two - week run . all told , @entity17 and company have grossed $ 357.8 million in theaters domestically over the last two decades . and then there 's the home market , where @entity5 is hoping buyers will seek out " @entity4 " on @entity23 when it debuts on oct. 4 . according to @entity24 , " @entity4 " has amassed $ 1.5 billion in home market revenue from video sales and rentals , and after the profitable publicity of this weekend , that number should be moving up shortly . " the @entity41 " converted " @entity4 " into @entity30 for a very low cost ( a rep for the studio said " the low single digits " ) , so even if the film completely bombs on dvd -- which it wo n't -- it 's already proving to be a big success . an impressive 92 percent of " @entity4 's " gross came from @entity30 screens , and it earned a terrific $ 12,575 per theater average by playing to a very wide range of moviegoers . people under the age of 25 made up 59 percent of the audience , as families ( who made up 74 percent of the audience ) took their kids to see the film . still , many couples and young people without children saw the film simply for nostalgic reasons . women slightly edged out men in rewatching the popular musical -- females made up 56 percent of the crowd . but enough about lions -- let 's get to the rest of the chart ! last weekend 's champ , " contagion , " came in second place , declining just 35 percent to $ 14.5 million and lifting its total to $ 44.2 million . the well - reviewed illness thriller remained a top choice for adult audiences on a weekend when " @entity77 , " " drive , " and " @entity78 " were all targeting them as well . if the @entity81 picture can maintain soft week - to - week drops , it will have no trouble earning back its $ 60 million budget . @entity86 's artsy thriller " drive " raced into third place with $ 11 million . the r - rated @entity90 production , directed by @entity91 , played mostly to an older crowd , as 75 percent of the audience was 25 or older . unfortunately , not everyone who saw the film liked it — despite strong critical reviews , audiences issued " drive " a harsh " c -- " @entity102 grade , which does not bode well for its box - office longevity . hopefully this is not a sign of things to come to @entity108 collaborations . the film earned a fair $ 3,818 per theater average . in fourth place was @entity5 's stalwart august release " the help , " which continued to work up solid numbers in its sixth weekend . the @entity117 adaptation fell by 28 percent to $ 6.4 million , and it has now earned $ 147.4 million against its $ 25 million budget . if only the films in fifth and sixth place were so lucky ... " @entity77 " debuted in fifth place with a very weak $ 5 million . the @entity122 remake ( of @entity124 's 1971 film with @entity125 ) , which played mostly to males ( 60 percent ) and older audiences ( 61 percent at least 25 years - old ) has already exhibited major frontloadedness , earning $ 2 million on friday but only 2.5 times that over the full frame . with a " c " cinemascore grade , " @entity77 " will be lucky to break $ 10 million total . next up was @entity134 's rom - com " @entity78 , " which i can only imagine is a two - hour clip of @entity137 wondering how she ( obviously , @entity138 ) , actually does it ( makes money at the box office ) . the @entity142 production , produced for about $ 20 - 25 million , earned just $ 4.5 million over the friday - to - sunday period , failing even to live up to @entity137 's 2009 box - office bomb " @entity145 ? , " which debuted to $ 6.6 million . the film was viewed by 74 percent females , and it received a " b -- " @entity102 grade . other notable box - office happenings this weekend : " @entity151 " crossed the $ 170 million plateau , " @entity153 " surpassed $ 80 million total , and " @entity155 : @entity159 " earned another $ 1.2 million out of only 230 theaters , lifting its 10 - day total to a remarkable $ 3.6 million . 1 . @entity4 -- $ 29.3 mil 2 . contagion -- $ 14.5 mil 3 . drive -- $ 11.0 mil 4 . the help -- $ 6.4 mil 5 . @entity77 -- $ 5.0 mil 6 . i do n't know who she does it -- $ 4.5 mil 7 . the debt -- $ 2.9 mil 8 . warrior -- $ 2.8 mil 9 . @entity151 -- $ 2.6 mil 10 . @entity169 -- $ 2.3 mil see the full story at @entity171 .	@entity23:Blu-ray 3D	@entity24:The-Numbers	@entity117:Kathryn Stockett	@entity81:Warner Brothers	@entity159:Laugh At My Pain	@entity138:Nala	@entity86:Ryan Gosling	@entity153:Crazy Stupid Love	@entity134:Sarah Jessica Parker	@entity137:Parker	@entity151:Rise of the Planet of the Apes	@entity155:Kevin Hart	@entity171:EW.com	@entity0:Nostalgia	@entity5:Disney	@entity4:The Lion King 3D	@entity78:I Do n't Know How She Does It	@entity77:Straw Dogs	@entity17:Simba	@entity30:3-D	@entity15:IMAX	@entity102:CinemaScore	@entity108:Gosling / Refn	@entity124:Sam Peckinpah	@entity125:Dustin Hoffman	@entity122:Sony	@entity91:Nicolas Winding Refn	@entity90:FilmDistrict	@entity145:Did You Hear About The Morgans	@entity142:Weinstein	@entity169:Colombiana	@entity41:Mouse House
rep. @placeholder reportedly told students suicide is due to a lack of support	@entity0	rep. @entity0 has never been known for mincing words , but his comments tuesday regarding suicide to an @entity4 took the " breath away " from his audience . school officials told local news that the @entity10 congressman was disrespectful and offensive in responding to sensitive questions from students and faculty at @entity15 on tuesday -- even when one question turned the conversation to suicide . @entity0 told the audience that a lack of support from friends and family can lead to suicides , @entity15 principal @entity19 told @entity28 affiliate @entity26 . those comments came just days after a @entity31 student committed suicide . " all of us first hand have been sitting with crying kids and we 've been talking to these families and we know how much these students are loved and supported and it just felt cruel to imply that there 's more the people who are left could have done , " @entity19 said . " the comments certainly took our breath away . " @entity0 is the only member of the @entity41 from @entity42 , which has the highest suicide rate in the country . and @entity19 told the @entity45 that a friend of the recent suicide victim shouted at @entity0 that the victim had both friends and support and that " it 's depression -- you know , a mental illness . " the congressman 's answer according to @entity0 : " ' well , what , do you just go to the doctor and get diagnosed with suicide ? ' " and @entity0 also reportedly told the school principal he thought the student who interjected was disrespectful . rep. @entity0 's spokesman @entity61 told @entity45 in an email that the congressman did not " mean to upset anyone with his well - intentioned message . " " in light of the tragic events affecting the @entity15 community , he should have taken a much more sensitive approach , " @entity61 said in the email . but @entity0 did n't just offend students and families mourning the death of one of their classmates . @entity0 also fielded a question on same - sex marriage . according to @entity19 , @entity0 said " you ca n't have marriage with two men . what do you get with two bulls ? " @entity0 's appearance at the high school was also reportedly peppered with profanity . it 's not the first time @entity0 has sparked controversy by opening his mouth , referring to immigrants who worked on his famiily ranch as a kid as " wetbacks .

@entity29 has echoed a complaint that @entity3 is a stooge of the @placeholder	@entity50	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- after emerging from the rubble of @entity7 's @entity6 palace late in august , @entity3 seized control as the military commander of @entity0 . an islamist who had taken little public part in the spring uprising against @entity7 , he claimed his soldiers had won the symbolic battle for the palace , the heart of the @entity1 strongman 's regime . by taking control of @entity0 , @entity3 gained authority over a third of the country 's population and a major slice of its wealth . it was a power play that other opposition fighters bitterly resented . @entity29 , one of several rival commanders , claims his fighters endured far tougher and more significant battles than the siege of @entity7 's palace , not least the struggle to win control of @entity0 's main international airport that lasted several days . in an interview with @entity2 he downplayed @entity3 's success and threatened confrontation , as internal divisions threaten to pull apart the coalition that brought @entity7 down . " who is @entity44 and who appointed him ? " @entity29 asks . " we do n't know him . we are the leaders , we are the revolutionists , we know everything . " @entity29 echoes a much wider complaint that @entity3 is actually a stooge of the @entity50 . " we know that @entity44 was in a school and @entity50 sends him money to buy weapons , " he said . in @entity0 today it 's a commonly held belief that @entity3 's @entity55 is getting direct funding from @entity50 . these concerns come amid reports that a @entity60 delegation traveled to @entity50 last week to raise the issue . @entity50 has been a principal player in pushing the revolution forward as part of the @entity60 alliance . now there 's growing unease in the @entity1 capital that fractures among the groups controlling the country could have roots in divisions among the international coalition that overthrew @entity7 . @entity3 , also known by his @entity74 , @entity75 , was the military leader of the @entity76 , @entity76 , and denies any nefarious ties to @entity50 . but @entity1 's rumor mill quickly turns suspicion into fact and he is finding it hard to shake the slur . his @entity76 began fighting @entity7 in the 1980s . after @entity7 successfully crushed the @entity76 , the group went underground and scattered . at its peak , the @entity76 had underground cells in more than 20 countries , including @entity86 , where it shared training camps with @entity89 . @entity3 had joined the new revolution with a ready - made army and a political religious ideology to boot . i know this because in 2009 i was trying to interview him when he was an inmate inside the notorious @entity96 jail in @entity0 . in his writings then , he was trying to lead the group away from violent jihad towards a more political ideology . the so - called recantation theories , a 400 - page manifesto he and several other fighting group leaders wrote from within the walls of the high security prison was the first ever direct jihadist challenge to @entity108 's nihilistic ideology . @entity108 and @entity3 had never been natural bedfellows , but now they were enemies . still , none of this cuts the mustard in @entity0 today ; he 's just another leader with an agenda . @entity7 himself predicted his detractors had little in common and would soon fight among themselves . sure enough , as weeks of street uprisings dragged out into months of @entity60 bombing , fractures appeared . @entity120 , @entity7 's old ally and military chief who deserted him for the rebels was murdered in suspicious circumstances . many feared it was the handiwork of the @entity126 cutting down a moderate who might have made deals with some of his former boss 's friends . today the fight is a war of words played out in the newly liberated conference halls of the capital . at the weekend , @entity138 ( @entity138 ) chairman @entity137 tried to reconcile the growing differences . after a contentious group meeting with all the commanders , the atmosphere became so heated that he was forced to meet the next day with individual factions seperately . on the capital 's streets , the power struggle has more sinister overtones . first , @entity3 , citing the @entity137 and the @entity138 's backing , called for all heavy weapons to be put under his command or moved out of the city . " we call on all the revolutionary brigades and small local councils to join this framework as acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the transitional council , " he said . it is statements like this that rankle with @entity29 . @entity29 claims it is his group , the @entity162 , that has the authority to have the weapons rounded up . legitimacy in the capital , he says , is garnered from the neighborhood councils established to funnel weapons to fighters before the final push to over throw @entity7 . but his challenge extends beyond @entity3 to the @entity138 and @entity137 , the man who many regard as the very glue holding the disparate groups together . " we gave this council the legitimacy and if we want we can withdraw the legitimacy from the transitional council ... . then we have no problem with withdrawing its legitimacy , " @entity29 said . the root of the problem is that many @entity1 's are loyal to family , tribe , village and town before nation . they 've fought often isolated in their towns , @entity192 in the western mountains , @entity194 under siege on the coast for 6 months and @entity197 , its own large fiefdom in the east . @entity0 's patchwork of neighborhood councils is but a minor mirror of that . @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 -- to name but a few -- saw many of the weapons smuggled in to the city over the summer . it 's given them muscle and the power to punch above their weight , as well as some freedom to choose sides . @entity3 claims many are loyal to him .

@entity10 and @placeholder deny embezzling money from @entity29 and @entity33	@entity11	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- defense lawyers for two sisters accused of embezzling money from celebrity chef @entity5 and her ex-husband @entity6 argued wednesday that they were caught in the middle of a personal battle . prosecution claims that @entity10 and @entity11 embezzled money have not been proved , their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments in a west @entity0 court . both defense lawyers questioned @entity5 's credibility as a witness and said their clients ' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue . the case has gripped @entity25 media , thanks to revelations of drug use by @entity29 and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to @entity33 , a millionaire art collector . both sisters deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the couple , saying their personal spending on @entity33 's company credit cards was authorized by @entity29 . @entity29 and @entity33 divorced this year after a very public argument at a @entity0 restaurant . @entity42 's defense lawyer , @entity41 , told the jury that @entity10 was the " soft underbelly " by which @entity33 was attacking @entity29 , adding that his client had been very close to the chef and her family . " my client has been caught in a collateral crossfire like a child in an acrimonious divorce , " he told the court . the jury must be sure that @entity29 had not authorized her spending " explicitly or implicitly " over the four years in question if they were to convict @entity10 , the lawyer said . @entity57 , representing @entity11 , said she had made no attempt to hide her spending , so it was impossible for @entity29 to say she was ignorant of it . she also stressed that @entity29 was not on trial . " this is not a day for you to say ' ooh , i like miss @entity5 , i like her cooking programs , ' " she told the jury . " this is a trial of my client . " @entity57 added that the prosecution had failed even to pin down the amount @entity11 is alleged to have embezzled . ' bolder and greedier ' however , @entity72 , giving the prosecution 's closing argument in the case , said that the sisters had abused their position " time and time again " and that they " grew bolder and greedier " as time went by . " just because @entity33 is a wealthy man , obviously it does n't mean he should be defrauded by the staff , " @entity72 said . " that seems to be what the defense are putting forward . " @entity72 said both sisters admitted they had used the company cards , given to them for household expenses , for personal expenditure . when they were first asked about that spending by @entity33 's accountant , they at no point argued then that it had been authorized , she said . they had sent a letter to @entity29 and @entity33 apologizing for the personal expenditure and had offered to pay it back , she said . the sisters knew @entity29 had used cocaine after the cancer diagnosis of her late first husband and used the revelation to cause a sensation at the trial , @entity72 said . she told the jury the only possible verdict in the case was guilty . ' a case with no winners ' allegations of repeated drug use by @entity29 have played a central part in the evidence presented to the court . the @entity11 sisters , while acknowledging that they had never seen @entity29 taking drugs , both said they had seen indications of frequent cocaine and cannabis use . @entity41 said the allegations about @entity29 's drug use were relevant because the issue had an impact on the chef 's credibility . the only real evidence about @entity10 's spending was from @entity29 , he said . " this is a case with no winners , " @entity41 said . " not mr. @entity6 , not ms. @entity5 and certainly not my client . " @entity57 suggested the court could not trust @entity29 's evidence because it was not in her interest for the truth about her drug use -- which was hidden from her then - husband -- to emerge . she said that if @entity29 had admitted authorizing the @entity11 sisters ' expenditure , @entity33 " would have been on her back . " @entity29 had to think of a way " to stop the dark secret coming out , " @entity57 said . " there was a massive attempt to limit the damage . " she added , " my client is somewhat piggy in the middle . " ' a life problem ' in her own testimony , @entity29 confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past . but she denied being a habitual user , saying , " i did not have a drug problem ; i had a life problem . " @entity6 had said in an e-mail that @entity29 had used drugs regularly , but in his testimony before the court last month , he backed off that claim . in the e-mail , which the defense shared with the court at a pretrial hearing , @entity6 wrote that the two assistants would probably " get off " because @entity29 was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and " allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked . " recounting @entity33 's testimony , @entity72 said he had never intended for that e-mail to be made public . he was being particularly nasty at a time he was upset after their separation and divorce , she said . like the @entity11 sisters , @entity6 told the court he had never seen @entity29 taking drugs , @entity72 said .	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:London	@entity6:Saatchi	@entity5:Nigella Lawson	@entity25:UK	@entity10:Elisabetta	@entity33:Saatchi	@entity187:Prosecution	@entity11:Francesca Grillo	@entity41:Metzer	@entity42:Elisabetta Grillo	@entity29:Lawson	@entity57:Arden	@entity72:Carpenter

" i 'm not worried about the situation , " @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview ahead of saturday 's @entity21 final between @entity22 and @entity23 in the @entity4 city . " the politicians they are in their role and the @entity7 they are in their role . i 'm in my role and that is not to do politics , it 's not to do religion and not to interfere in everything . " that means they can say what they want -- we continue to organize the @entity41 . if @entity4 is in final of the @entity41 i would be sure that madame @entity3 would come to the final . " such a scenario -- and it is very possible given @entity4 are one of the tournament favorites -- would represent something of a u-turn for @entity3 given earlier this month she told the @entity50 , the lower house of the @entity4 @entity51 , that in @entity7 and @entity55 " people are still suffering under dictatorship and repression . " no regrets while admitting @entity2 had taken a risk in giving @entity6 to @entity16 and @entity7 , @entity1 insisted he had no regrets about the @entity61 governing body 's decision to award the tournament to the two @entity61 neighbors . " four years ago when all the slides were red , red , red , red , red -- stadium , roads , accommodation was red , red , red , red it was not easy . ok we took the risk but i say it was a good risk . " as well as dealing with the political fall - out from @entity7 's strained relationship with the @entity72 , @entity2 is implementing a set of financial regulations -- @entity75 ( @entity75 ) - that are designed to compel most teams to live within their means . the @entity75 rules apply now but will come fully into force in 2014 . but this new stringent financial regime has raised the question as to whether @entity2 would prevent a big - spending team like @entity84 , which has incurred large debts after spending up to $ 1.5b on winning the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) for the first time this season , from competing in the @entity21 . " i 'm happy for them , " said @entity1 , as he congratulated @entity84 on their title success . " but they will know what we will do . and if they are in the @entity75 they will play our competition but we will look at them like we will look at everyone else . " we prepare everything with the clubs -- we gave them four years to prepare something for the future , " added @entity1 . " we will never go back . " technology opposed the former @entity105 and @entity106 midfielder and @entity108 captain , who led @entity108 when they won the @entity110 in 1984 , remains equally resolute in his opposition to @entity113 's likely introduction of goal - line technology in the summer . the @entity86 wants to introduce goal - line technology as early as next season if football 's rule - makers -- the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) -- sanction its use in july . " i 'm against the technology , " said @entity1 . " if you say ok to goal - line technology , then it is offside technology , then penalty area technology , and we stop the football . i want human people -- it 's easy . i understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice . " @entity113 president @entity135 has indicated he is in favor of goal - line technology and would like to see it in place for the @entity140 in @entity141 , but @entity1 has not given up all hope that the @entity143 may still change his mind . " i am football , he is political . " said @entity1 . " he changes his mind . he said last year in the @entity119 never technology , never . this year he changed , he 's says let 's go technology . i hope next year he will say no technology . " looking ahead to saturday 's showpiece event between @entity23 and @entity22 , @entity1 insisted that that best two teams had reached the final , despite the widely held view that their respective semifinal opponents -- @entity156 and @entity157 -- are @entity2 's strongest teams . " could be , but the result is there -- it 's @entity22 against @entity23 . i did n't see @entity156 be better than @entity23 and i did n't see @entity157 be better than @entity22 in these games , " said the @entity2 president . surprising season " everything was surprising -- the non-qualification of some of the @entity167 teams to the second round , the fact that @entity23 and @entity22 were not favorites for the semifinals and they beat @entity156 and @entity157 . it has been incredible year for the legend of the cup .

@placeholder , aka " @entity3 , " is out with a new book , " @entity8 "	@entity3	before sitting down with " @entity2 mom " @entity3 , i was fairly certain there was nothing i would find redeeming about her or her new book , " @entity8 , " with its message that women should spend 75 % of their time in college looking for a man . after all , her letter to the " @entity16 " last year , which went viral , outraged many women , myself included , with its message that a woman should find a husband on campus before she graduates . what ? have n't we come a long way , baby , from the days when a woman 's only focus was marriage and motherhood ? after my hourlong conversation and polite give and take with @entity30 , a 59 - year - old human resources consultant and executive coach , i found myself still not agreeing with much of what she thinks but understanding the reasoning behind her efforts to get the conversation going . i remember seeing a magazine piece shortly after i graduated college in the late 1980s that pictured a 40 - something business woman with a title something along the lines of " i forgot to have kids . " dating checklists : practical or nitpicky ? that image , and the harsh reality at that time for many highly successful professional women , stayed with me for years . i continued my career as a fairly hard - driving news reporter , but in the back of my mind , i knew that i wanted children and did n't want to wake up one day regretting that i never made motherhood a priority . in a small but highly controversial way , @entity30 may be doing something similar for young women in college who want to get married and have kids someday . " honey , keep this in mind . you can not wait forever to get married and have children , " she tells them , citing declining fertility rates for women in their 30s . while i understand @entity30 's desire to have young women feel more comfortable admitting whether they want motherhood in addition to ( or in the absence of ) a career , i wondered if her delivery , and her words , are doing more to set modern women back . single woman seeking part - time lover ? @entity30 , who is divorced and whose sons followed her to @entity2 ( one is still an undergraduate ) , did n't mince words during our conversation . an edited version of our talk is below : @entity89 : do you consider yourself a feminist ? @entity30 : of course , i am fully supportive of equal rights and equal opportunity for women , and i recognize that i am one of the earliest beneficiaries of the good works of the women 's movement . ... however , feminism has taken a turn to the dark side . feminists have become antagonistic . they 've become bullying of women who aspire to traditional roles , women who want anything for themselves different from what the feminists , the very strident feminists ' doctrine , is directing them towards . @entity89 : forget the feminist label . many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make , and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood , too . are people without kids happier ? @entity30 : in my experience , i certainly agree that modern women today do want marriage and motherhood . the problem is they 're afraid to say so because of the vitriol , because of this antagonist feminist doctrine that would have them believe that marriage and motherhood is somehow not cool . ... it 's so retro . it 's so backwards . it 's so 1950s . @entity89 : i do n't know if people would say it 's so retro . ... you want to be empowered to have the career choices you want to have as well as be a mother and be in a relationship if you want marriage and family , too . @entity30 : if you delay starting a family and finding a husband until your mid- 30s , a few things happen . one , from the perspective of your fertility , you 're out of luck or maybe you 're out of luck . ... the other component of this , so you 're 35 , who are you going to be looking at to marry ? i 'm going to say most women who are 35 are going to be looking for a man around the same age , or maybe a year or two older . so let 's take the man of 36 . he 's quite happy to actually be with a woman 10 years younger . @entity89 : you say women should spend 75 % of their time in college looking for a man versus 25 % on their career . how is that not setting women back professionally in terms of their future careers that you admit are important ? @entity30 : i do n't think it hurts them at all because you can make up lost time at work . work a little harder , it 's ok . you can make up that lost time if you are focused on your personal happiness , which i guarantee you will outlast your professional happiness . your career is going to come to an end eventually . @entity89 : had i married any of my boyfriends in college , i 'd be divorced . @entity30 : i 've heard this argument before , that in your early 20s , you do n't know who you are going to evolve into by the time you 're 30 . if you wait until you 're 30 to get married , you do n't know who you are going to evolve into by the time that you 're 40 , but i can guarantee you it 'll be somebody very different than you were when you were 30 . ... i think the smartest thing that a young woman or a young man can do is find a life partner who shares your values , who shares your love of learning , who shares your intellectual curiosity , who will applaud you , who will encourage you , and who you can grow with and evolve with through the decades . @entity89 : i 'm lucky . i got married at 36 . @entity30 : right under the wire . @entity89 : you talk about " @entity203 " and spending more time in college to find that right person , but you have to believe it 's also very important for women , at the same time , to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end ; 50 % of marriages end in divorce . @entity30 : i 'm saying by all means develop your career , develop your professional self because that 's critically important . ... women have to know that they are responsible for their own safety . they 're responsible for their own happiness . i am not saying a man is going to make you happy . i 'm not saying that a marriage will make you happy . i hope it does , but do n't expect that . do n't expect to only be happy because of your marriage . happiness comes from within clearly , and obviously nobody knows better than a divorced person how happy a marriage can make you ( or ) not . @entity89 : i cracked up when i read what you wrote : " be aware of marrying a dumb guy for good sex . the sex wo n't improve , and he 'll never get smarter . " @entity30 : there are two barnyard analogies that i cite regularly . the first is men will not buy the cow if the milk is free , and that 's the truth . if you give men sex without commitment , you have eliminated the incentive for them to commit . ... an equally important barnyard analogy has to do with just what you 're talking about : the bad guys , the crazy boys , just the men you know you should n't spend time with . i 'm telling women avoid wasting time with the pigs for the sake of a little sausage . @entity89 : ca n't stop laughing . @entity30 : it 's absolutely true . i understand that women have needs , but not with that . @entity89 : you basically say if you require major ( cosmetic ) bodywork , get it done in high school . that 's pretty outrageous . we want to encourage our girls to love themselves . the last thing we want to do is push them to have plastic surgery . @entity30 : i would never have plastic surgery , and i would n't recommend it for anybody except if you have a tragic flaw , something that enters the room before you do such that you are hounded by it , such that it so impacts your self - image . @entity89 : how do your sons feel about your newfound celebrity and your views ? @entity30 : there 's not a thing that i 've said that they have n't heard me say for decades . they are delighted that i found another platform by which to share my views with a broader audience , and they are absolutely delighted that i am having so much fun doing it . @entity89 : you have to have a pretty thick skin , i think , to put yourself out there with a very controversial position and not feel the blowback . @entity30 : it does n't bother me at all because i am so completely confident in what i 'm saying . ... there was nothing in this for me other than my absolute conviction that this is a message that our young women need because all they 're hearing is you have to focus on work , work , work . @entity89 : do you feel misunderstood by many women who are criticizing you and who say you are setting women back ? @entity30 : well , they clearly have n't read what i 've written . they 've controverted what i 've said for their own purposes , or they 're so caught up in trying to look politically correct that they 've gone in a different direction from where i 'm writing . i 'm not criticizing anybody . i 'm not suggesting that you not pursue a career . i 'm just saying if you know this is what you want , plan for it because it does n't just happen . @entity89 : many people think you are evil . @entity30 : i 'm not the one that 's evil . i 'm trying to encourage a conversation . i 'm trying to bring to the fore a dialogue that 's been suppressed . it 's the feminists that are looking to continue to suppress the conversation . that 's evil . what do you think of @entity30 's argument that women who want to get married should look for a husband in college ? @entity347 in below in the comments or tell @entity349 on @entity350 or @entity351 on @entity352 .	@entity3:Princeton Mom	@entity2:Princeton	@entity30:Patton	@entity8:Marry Smart	@entity89:Kelly	@entity349:Kelly Wallace	@entity203:Marrying Smart	@entity347:Chime	@entity351:CNN Living	@entity350:Twitter	@entity16:Daily Princetonian	@entity352:Facebook

" " if this reflects @entity1 as a whole , it is the highest rate in the larger region , a result of the loss of men of marrying age as a result of the conflict , " the survey said . @entity19 and its @entity1 partner group @entity53 , conducted the survey in five provinces -- @entity0 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 . questioners interviewed 1,700 respondents starting last summer . while the survey does n't represent the situation facing all @entity1 , it provides " a disturbing snapshot of many women 's lives and those of their children and other family members . " " a quarter of the women interviewed still do not have daily access to water , a third can not send their children to school and , since the war started , over half have been the victim of violence , " @entity36 said .

@placeholder said 9/11 attacks were justified reaction to @entity17 @entity18 policies	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- a professor who compared some victims of the @entity4 attack on the @entity5 to @entity6 was fired tuesday by the @entity8 's @entity7 . professor @entity9 wrote that some 9/11 victims were " little eichmanns . " @entity9 raised hackles with a 2002 essay that argued the september 11 , 2001 , attacks were a justified reaction to @entity17 policies in the @entity18 , and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 had " the courage of their convictions . " but the regents said @entity9 's firing was unrelated to the essay , which went largely unnoticed for three years . instead , it cited " deliberate and repeated research misconduct . " a university investigation had found cases of plagiarism and falsification in previous papers by @entity9 -- allegations that surfaced after his essay became widely known . " the board of regents affirms that its decisions in this matter have been made solely on the basis of the allegations of research misconduct against professor @entity9 and have not been influenced or motivated by extrinsic considerations , professor @entity9 's political and social views or a desire to punish professor @entity9 for expression of his political or social views , " the university announced . @entity8 interim chancellor @entity54 recommended @entity9 's dismissal in june 2006 after a university committee completed its investigation . @entity9 's essay drew little notice until a 1,800 - student college in @entity61 invited him to take part in a 2005 forum on prisons and native american rights . the invitation was rescinded after criticism from then - @entity21 gov. @entity68 , then - @entity70 gov. @entity69 and hundreds of relatives of those killed in the attacks created a media firestorm . the piece had called some of those who died in the @entity5 " little eichmanns " -- a reference to @entity83 , the @entity84 officer who was one of the chief architects of the @entity86 -- arguing they were " a technocratic corps at the very heart of @entity17 's global financial empire .

@entity3 officials are holding 15 suspects in the killing of four @placeholder	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 officials are considering what could happen to 15 alleged @entity6 pirates held on the @entity8 aircraft carrier following the killings of four @entity3 who were sailing around the world on a private yacht . @entity14 spokesman col. @entity13 referred questions on possible prosecution of the @entity6 to the @entity17 as well as to the @entity18 , which is heading the investigation off the coast of @entity6 focused on the 58 - foot - yacht quest that was seized by pirates last week . " they 'll be detained until the @entity17 makes a determination about possible prosecution , " @entity13 said . " the process is going on now to determine where they 'll be prosecuted . " @entity17 officials who will decide where and when the alleged pirates will be prosecuted were tight - lipped wednesday , but one senior law enforcement official acknowledged the transfer of the suspects to the @entity18 for a trial in the @entity3 will occur " soon . " two officials indicated the suspects would be tried in a @entity3 civilian court , but declined to say where . in previous cases involving @entity6 pirates and @entity3 vessels , the trials for suspects turned over from the @entity43 to the @entity18 were held in @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 . according to @entity3 officials , the four @entity3 -- ship owners @entity48 and @entity49 , along with @entity50 and @entity51 -- were found shot after @entity3 forces boarded the @entity54 early tuesday . @entity55 died from their wounds . the quest was being shadowed by four @entity3 warships after pirates seized it off the coast of @entity61 on friday . @entity3 forces responded after a rocket - propelled grenade was fired at a @entity43 ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on @entity54 , according to @entity43 vice adm. @entity66 . the killings signal escalating violence by @entity6 pirates who have increased torture and attacks on hostages in a bid to speed up the process of getting ransom money , said a spokesman for the @entity77 combating the piracy . what started several years ago as local piracy by @entity6 fishermen has been taken over by organized - crime elements that are well - armed and intent on cashing in on a lucrative operation , according to wing commander @entity85 of @entity86 . " it was a real surprise to us that they had done this . normally , that 's their income , " @entity85 said , calling the pirates ' killing of hostages " literally shooting the hen that lays the golden eggs . " @entity99 , a former @entity3 ambassador to @entity100 now with the @entity101 think tank , said the @entity6 piracy was evolving " into a grotesque form of something like a big business . " international naval forces , including participation by the @entity3 and the @entity77 , have managed to reduce piracy in the @entity109 off @entity6 , a key shipping route , @entity99 noted . now the pirates are operating in open waters farther away , making international monitoring and protection more difficult , @entity99 said . " all of this would indicate that ending or controlling @entity6 piracy is no longer , if it ever was , purely a naval operation , " he said . @entity99 called for a broader approach , including international law enforcement and judicial procedures , anti-corruption forces and international development agencies to work on land as well as on the water . " you can not just simply snap your fingers and solve this , " @entity99 said . " it is not a case of sending an aircraft carrier to the horn of @entity133 . it 's a real international conundrum . " earlier , @entity13 said it was too early to say if the killing of the four @entity3 would bring a change to @entity3 policy or tactics regarding the @entity6 pirates . @entity85 , however , noted the increasing use of violence by pirates against hostages indicated a change in their tactics . " these guys want money , they want it now , and they 're prepared to do whatever it takes to force the companies to pay up " right away , @entity85 said . " we 've seen a rise in violence toward hostages at a relatively kind of steady increase , " he said , noting the torture reports and now the killings . of reports of hostages being tortured on several vessels , @entity85 said : " it was n't kind of rough treatment ; it was pretty systematic torture . " @entity99 said shipping companies , their insurers , governments patrolling the waters off of @entity6 and others already are confronting the " huge " cost of piracy . now the increased threat to hostages raises the stakes even further , he said . " obviously it 's going to be a concern to any government that cares about its citizens , " @entity99 said , later adding : " the concern would be that if ransoms are n't paid , they 'll kill .

" i want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge , " @entity24 said tuesday afternoon . " it absolutely does not represent the beliefs or opinions of my office . i want to be very clear about that . " the senator said as soon as she found out about the e-mail , she consulted the @entity54 's human resources office , then followed their advice . " ms. @entity10 did get a verbal reprimand as well as a very strongly worded reprimand , written , that was put in her file that if this should ever occur again , that she would be terminated , " @entity24 said . watch sen. @entity24 discuss her response » " this is an employee who has had a stellar record , " @entity24 said . she added that @entity10 has worked in state government for more than 20 years , and has had a clean record .

" i am calling on sen. black to reject this racist smear and fire this staffer who , on state government time , on state government computers , using a state government e-mail account , launched this bigoted attack on our president , " @entity77 said . " keeping her on the staff would send the message that this type of behavior is condoned by the @entity39 . " " this e-mail is reprehensible , insults the office of the president , and is embarrassing to all @entity100 regardless of political party , " @entity77 said . @entity10 told @entity102 of the web site @entity32 is talking that she had received a letter of reprimand from her superiors but will remain on the job . @entity102 said @entity10 told him she felt " very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list " of people .

" @entity77 , in his web posting , said , " ms. @entity10 does not seem to understand what she did wrong . she has apologized for ' sending [ the e-mail ] to the wrong list of people . ' i believe that any list of people would have recognized this e-mail as offensive and hateful . " state rep. @entity124 , @entity125 , a member of the black and @entity2 caucuses , said @entity10 should be dismissed .

" several other black @entity2 lawmakers agreed @entity10 should quit . " the last thing we need in the state of @entity3 is to send out the impression and the image that we are still stuck in some backwater mentality and culture that feels it 's ok to depict the president of the @entity20 in that fashion , " state rep. @entity145 , @entity146 , told @entity0 . @entity77 added : " unfortunately , @entity10 's e-mail joins the list of shameful episodes by @entity160 , from the infamous ' @entity162 ' direct - mail piece that featured black crows with the heads of @entity7 and [ @entity165 ] rep. @entity166 , to the " @entity174 " song that former @entity169 chairman @entity168 sent to @entity171 members during his failed campaign for @entity171 chair .

@entity2 has new album , " @placeholder , " produced by @entity7	@entity15	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 is in a celebratory mood . and rightly so : she 's survived 50 years in show business . @entity2 says that her new @entity7 - produced album was meant to sound like a throwback to the folk era . the legendary singer , who rose to fame during the folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s , is marking the occasion with a new album called " @entity15 . " produced by @entity7 ( whom @entity2 likes to call " @entity17 " ) , it 's a collection of bluegrass - tinged songs reminiscent of her early repertoire . " we were looking for songs that feel like now but sound like back then , " she said . @entity7 penned one of the album 's standout tracks , " @entity27 is @entity27 , " which he describes as " recovery speak . " @entity2 also covers " @entity30 , " a song written by @entity32 and @entity33 for the 2003 film " @entity35 . " at 67 , @entity2 finds her voice may not have the sheer power it did in her 20s , but her political spirit is intact . she passionately expressed her support for @entity42 during the presidential campaign , the first time the self - described pacifist has taken sides in party politics . " i have n't heard an orator like that since @entity49 , " she said . @entity2 knew the rev. @entity49 and famously sang the protest song " we shall overcome " to a massive crowd at the @entity53 during @entity49 's 1963 march on @entity54 . @entity2 spoke to @entity1 about sustaining her voice and finding happiness in her 60s . the following is an edited version of that interview , which was conducted before tuesday 's election . @entity1 : what did @entity7 bring to the table with your new album ? @entity2 : oh , everything but the voice . @entity68 , some songs . his gruffness to my non-gruffness . he worked fast , really fast , and i like that . and he brought the musicians . i do n't know who to choose for musicians . we were a good match . @entity1 : is there a song on the album that speaks to you more than others ? @entity2 : i guess the ones i go back listening to are " @entity27 is @entity27 " and " @entity85 . " " @entity85 " sounds exactly like an old folk song . i would n't have guessed in a million years that it 's contemporary . @entity1 : how does it feel to be embarking on a new tour at such a politically charged time ? @entity2 : i 've never seen this country this politically charged . i realized something this morning . i was watching @entity42 on tv and i thought , " i really love this guy . " i love what he 's capable of , i love that he 's genuine . he 's a statesman , and he 's brilliant . people say do you think he can change @entity98 ? he already has . ... and i know most of the things he 'll have to do i would battle him to the death . he 's going to be commander in chief of the @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , and i 'm a pacifist [ laughs ] . @entity1 : so you would almost prefer that he did n't run for president , that his talents could be applied in other ways ? @entity2 : yeah . i 've thought that , yeah . part of me wishes very strongly that @entity42 would be outside the system and his hands would be less tied . @entity1 : in the ' 50s and ' 60s , you lived and breathed the causes you rallied behind . when you look at young musicians today , do you feel they 're attaching themselves to charities or causes because it 's hip , rather than meaningful ? @entity2 : i think it 's probably a combination of things . i think people are afraid of risk so they 'll [ only ] go so far . but i do n't think people have felt the urgency that we felt in the ' 60s . but it 's there . the urgency is there . there 's a need for community , but we do n't feel it . @entity1 : why is that ? @entity2 : that we do n't feel it ? because we live more and more separately . kids are walking down the street plugged in [ to personal electronics ] . the only place there 's community really is in the ghetto , where they need each other and they know it . we need each other , and we do n't know it . @entity1 : you look back at all the causes you 've rallied behind , and there have been so many . ... @entity2 : it makes me dizzy . @entity1 : [ @entity160 ] you feel emotionally wrung out ? @entity2 : no. it 's the opposite . what happens is it starts generating energy for myself . there 's some part of me that 's wiped out . i feel that sometimes . @entity1 : do you find you have to work harder to keep your voice in shape ? @entity2 : oh @entity27 , yeah . it was very humiliating to find out that i was like everybody else in the world and that i had to get coaching . and now it 's a real issue . i have to do [ vocal exercises ] every day , especially on tour . it 's pretty exhausting . @entity1 : would you say that life in your 60s is easier than life in your 20s and 30s ? @entity2 : oh @entity27 , yes . ... i was a highly neurotic kid , not particularly happy , which probably accounts for all those beautiful songs , those beautiful sad ballads . i found my home there . and as the years went by and as the therapy went on i was holding together . and then at around 50 , i decided to fall apart and find the pieces and put them back where they should 've been . and i did . and i did what i thought was impossible , which was really drag the stuff up , look at it , go through all that and then each time i did that ... it became a daily thing with the therapist ... to find out something huge . go through the terror , go through all of it and then by the end of the week something had changed a little bit . this went on for a number of years . so i am now in a stage nothing like where i was before then . there 's no stage fright now . just the joy of singing . @entity1 : you 're happy being single , are n't you ? @entity2 : yeah . after all i 've been through , i do n't want to risk [ pats her heart ] . i mean i feel so extraordinary , so much better . and you know if something walked into my life that feels right ... the question is , am i ready to see it or not ? i 'm sure it 's wandered by me a few times . but at some point maybe i 'll be ready to see that in which case it would be a good thing . ... [ in ] @entity230 there 's no real happiness without the struggle . but the struggle has to defeat you in a way [ before ] you get to be like the @entity236 . you know those monks all giggle ? all the time ! they 've got it figured out . because things are what they are on @entity244 , and you be as good as you can , and you die , it 's the next life . so what 's the big f * * * * * * deal ?	@entity27:God	@entity15:Day After Tomorrow	@entity85:Rose of Sharon	@entity256:Singer	@entity2:Baez	@entity230:Buddhism	@entity0:NEW YORK	@entity7:Steve Earle	@entity53:Lincoln Memorial	@entity54:Washington	@entity17:Mister Gruff	@entity30:Scarlet Tide	@entity33:T Bone Burnett	@entity32:Elvis Costello	@entity35:Cold Mountain	@entity42:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity244:Earth	@entity104:Army	@entity105:Navy	@entity106:Air Force	@entity98:America	@entity236:Dalai Lama	@entity160:Do	@entity68:Spirit	@entity49:King

" the cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in @entity53 . it broadly mocks @entity64 's efforts to revive the economy . again , @entity71 reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist , " he said , referencing a news release the civil rights activist sent out blasting the paper and demanding an apology . @entity27 , the cartoonist , said to @entity14 , " it 's absolutely friggin ridiculous . do you really think i 'm saying @entity15 should be shot ? i did n't see that in the cartoon . the chimpanzee was a major story in the @entity12 . every paper in @entity81 , except the @entity82 , covered the chimpanzee story . it 's just ridiculous . it 's about the economic stimulus bill . if you 're going to make that about anybody , it would be [ @entity90 , which it 's not . " watch @entity2 , other @entity14 panelists debate cartoon » to the editors who approved the cartoon , as well as the cartoonist , the piece was clearly all fun and laughs . but anyone with half a brain , especially someone knowing the history of african - americans being called monkeys and gorillas , would have said , " we need to rethink this . " first , mixing the two stories is ridiculous . yes , the chimpanzee incident and the passage of the stimulus bill have a lot of folks talking , but to put them in the same element just does n't make sense . watch civil rights groups criticize the cartoon » second , the cartoonist did n't hang a sign around the neck of the chimp , so he left it up to the reader to determine exactly who the cops were referring to . we all know that the stimulus bill was the first priority of the new president , so when reading the caption , it was easy to infer that the cartoonist was implying the president of the @entity8 . you know , the black guy . and that 's where the problem comes in . what could be seen as silly humor if president @entity141 were in the @entity142 has to be seen through the lens of @entity8 's racist past , as noted by the leaders of the @entity146 , who also are demanding an apology from the @entity12 . @entity149 : @entity150 very offended by cartoon " how do you think the jewish community would feel about the use of rats in any depiction of them ? how do you think the @entity161 community would feel about being generalized with mobsters ? " the organization said in a statement . " monkey slurs against @entity164 and african - americans go back to the days of early colonialism , when @entity166 , @entity168 and @entity169 conquerors used these types of drawings and descriptions to dehumanize black people so that their mistreatment and enslavement would not be viewed as wrong or sinful . the practice also took on more sinister roles later in history including during the slave trade here in the @entity8 and in @entity182 's @entity181 . " ignorant leaders of the @entity12 and others may think everything is fair game , and certainly criticizing the president of the @entity8 is just fine . yet while everyone seems to be caught up in the delusion of a post-racial @entity8 , we can not forget the reality of the racial @entity8 , where @entity164 - @entity8 were treated and portrayed as inferior and less than others . and just as some members of the media brotherhood were taken to task for their obvious sexism during the @entity198 primaries because of comments about then - sen. @entity200 , we had to be sensitive to the historical treatment of women . oh yes , the @entity12 will have its defenders , accusing african - americans and others of being hypersensitive . the @entity12 has already shown its hand by trying to make this all about @entity71 , since they know he 's the black bogeyman to white @entity8 . but they should understand that my e-mail box and @entity214 page are filled with comments from folks of different backgrounds stunned by the callousness of the @entity12 . ireport.com : is the cartoon racist ? i guess it 's fitting the cartoon ran today , because the best statement to sum up the issue can be taken from a black history month speech given today by our first black attorney general , @entity226 . " even as we fight a war against terrorism , deal with the reality of electing an @entity233 as our president for the first time and deal with the other significant issues of the day , the need to confront our racial past -- and our racial present , and to understand the history of @entity164 people in this country -- endures , " he said . " one can not truly understand @entity8 without understanding the historical experience of black people in this nation . simply put , to get to the heart of this country , one must examine its racial soul . " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .	@entity169:Portuguese	@entity27:Delonas	@entity81:New York	@entity82:New York Times	@entity150:iReporter	@entity214:Facebook	@entity2:Martin	@entity7:Black Man	@entity5:Brother	@entity198:Democratic	@entity8:America	@entity53:Connecticut	@entity71:Sharpton	@entity142:White House	@entity15:Obama	@entity14:CNN	@entity12:NY Post	@entity233:African-American	@entity18:Tom Daschle	@entity200:Hillary Clinton	@entity90:House Speaker Nancy ] Pelosi	@entity146:New York Association of Black Journalists	@entity161:Italian	@entity166:Anglo Saxon	@entity141:George W.

@placeholder had said he 's innocent , telling the judge , " the evidence speaks for itself "	@entity23	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the man who prosecutors said captained a team of masked men dressed as ninjas as they ambushed a @entity1 home has been found guilty on two counts of first - degree murder . a @entity12 jury determined thursday evening that @entity13 followed through on his plan and fatally shot @entity15 and @entity13 in the couple 's master bedroom , as one of their nine special - needs children looked on . he was also found guilty of armed home - invasion robbery . during the trial , @entity23 frequently conversed with his attorneys , shook his head and even smirked . he told judge @entity27 that he did n't need to call any witnesses or testify on his own behalf , because " the evidence speaks for itself . " and after the jury came out to ask a question during their four hours of deliberations , he said , " i 've already been tried and convicted by the media . " but @entity23 was stoic just before the verdict came in . meanwhile , members of the @entity37 family cried in the courtroom , with @entity15 's and @entity40 's daughter @entity39 hugging prosecutors . @entity23 nodded to the @entity37 family -- as he 'd done earlier thursday -- after he was fingerprinted and led away . the jury of 11 women and one man deliberated for four hours before reaching the verdict . in that time , they requested to see a 14 - minute surveillance video , culled from 16 cameras around the @entity37 house that were set up around the house to watch the nine special - needs children that the couple had adopted and were in the house of the time of the murder . one video showed a masked man -- who @entity58 , a member of the group , identified as @entity23 -- shooting @entity13 once in each leg . another video showed a scene from a girl 's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house . the girl gets up from bed as the masked men enter the house , then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby . the van was owned by @entity23 . a camera was not in the master bedroom . but @entity58 said that @entity23 led the @entity37 ' couple into the room . and expert witnesseses showed how @entity23 shot @entity13 once in the head and twice more as he lay face down on the floor , and then shot @entity13 through the head and chest . during closing arguments , assistant state attorney @entity85 painted an involved picture depicting @entity23 as the ringleader who hatched the plan , formed the team , outfitted six other men with guns and clothes , then led them as they barged into the @entity37 ' large home in @entity97 , @entity1 . he said @entity23 was motivated by " simple greed " -- pointing to testimony from the defendant 's wife that the family 's business , a karate school , had gone under and they had dwindling means to take care of their six children . @entity23 knew @entity37 , who gave $ 5,000 to a self - defense charity he started , and he knew he had money , @entity85 said . @entity23 provided the all - black clothing , boots and guns and briefed the attackers prior to the invasion , according to @entity85 . he said that @entity23 also did " all the talking [ and ] all the muscling " when the group entered the residence . " the puzzle pieces all come together , and they prove an ugly story , " said @entity85 . " there is no doubt that @entity122 is the man who had his finger ... on the trigger . " @entity125 , one of @entity23 's attorneys , criticized the state 's case as overly reliant on circumstantial evidence and two men , @entity131 and @entity58 , who confessed their involvement and named @entity23 as the leader of the band of masked men and the shooter . @entity137 said there was no mention anyone would be killed until he overheard @entity23 say he was " going to kill somebody " minutes before they went to the house . prosecutors called the testimony of the two -- who were age 16 and 19 , respectively , when the crime took place -- measured and reliable , and supported by the other evidence in the case . but both @entity137 and @entity58 , who have pleaded guilty to second - degree murder for their roles , admitted first lying to family and law enforcement before changing their stories . " they 're hanging their hat on the testimony of those admitted liars , " @entity125 said of the prosecution . dna tests on the 9 mm pistol and bullet casings that killed the @entity37 ' couple did not conclusively point to @entity23 , @entity125 pointed out . he said , too , that there was minimal effort to clean the alleged murder weapon . " we do n't have to prove who the killer was , " @entity125 said . " no matter how tragic this murder is , if you have one reasonable doubt , then you have a duty to return a verdict of not guilty . " @entity137 and @entity58 testified that @entity23 said they were after $ 13 million of money laundered from " the @entity182 mafia . " a small safe that was stolen and later found in the back yard of one of @entity23 's friends contained prescription medication , family documents and some jewelry . two sources familiar with the investigation told @entity2 that a second safe at the home contained at least $ 100,000 . in final comments , @entity85 reminded the jury of @entity23 's own words after he first spoke to police , when he reportedly said , " i 'm in deep , i 'll take the heat . " " the defense attorney labeled [ @entity23 ] @entity23 as being somewhat goofy , " said @entity85 . " folks , he 's not goofy . he 's a murderer -- a plain , cold - blooded murderer . " the penalty phase in @entity23 's trial starts friday morning , judge @entity27 said . in @entity205 's @entity204 and @entity206 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Gonzalez	@entity27:Geeker	@entity85:Molchan	@entity137:Florence	@entity131:Rakeem Florence	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Florida	@entity0:Pensacola	@entity58:Thornton	@entity15:Byrd	@entity13:Leonard Gonzalez Jr.	@entity12:Escambia County	@entity37:Billings	@entity39:Ashley Markham	@entity97:Beulah	@entity125:Gontarek	@entity122:Leonard Patrick Gonzalez	@entity206:Nancy Leung	@entity205:Session	@entity204:Jean Casarez	@entity182:Mexican	@entity40:Melanie
@entity1 said his hardest decision so far is sending more troops to @placeholder	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- president @entity1 said in an interview aired sunday that the hardest decision he 's made since taking office was to send more troops to @entity6 . in a " @entity8 " interview , president @entity1 said , " i fundamentally disagree with @entity9 . " also in the interview on @entity10 ' " @entity8 , " @entity1 defended his decision to shut down the @entity13 prison at @entity14 , @entity15 , and he countered criticism from former vice president @entity9 . " i fundamentally disagree with @entity9 -- not surprisingly , " @entity1 said . " i think that vice president @entity9 has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we ca n't reconcile our core values , our @entity22 , our belief that we do n't torture , with our national security interests . i think he 's drawing the wrong lesson from history . " @entity1 was responding to comments @entity9 made to @entity0 's " @entity28 " on march 15 , when he said the president is making the nation less safe by closing the @entity14 prison and ending interrogation practices that @entity34 administration critics consider torture for terror suspects . just a month into office , @entity1 ordered 17,000 troops to @entity6 , the original front in the " war on terrorism " sparked by the september 2001 attacks on @entity43 and @entity44 . " i think it 's the right thing to do . but it 's a weighty decision because we actually had to make the decision prior to the completion of the strategic review that we were conducting , " @entity1 said . coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of @entity53 , @entity1 said treasury secretary @entity55 's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation . @entity1 joked that even if @entity55 were to tender his resignation , the president would tell him , " sorry buddy , you 've still got the job . " @entity55 has come under fire over the $ 165 million in bonuses @entity53 paid its top executives after the insurance giant received more than $ 170 billion in federal bailout money . a loophole in the recently approved economic stimulus bill , included at the behest of the @entity69 , allowed @entity53 to pay the bonuses . " it 's going to take a little bit more time than we would like to make sure that we get this plan just right , " @entity1 said . the president also stressed that his administration wo n't endorse a @entity78 bill that would levy a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that receive bailout money . " as a general proposition , you do n't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals , " @entity1 said . " you want to pass laws that have some broad applicability ... you certainly do n't want to use the tax code to punish people .

relics found from battle between @entity7 , @placeholder in third century	@entity8	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- archaeologists have found more than 600 relics from a huge battle between a @entity7 army and @entity8 in the third century , long after historians believed @entity10 had given up control of northern @entity1 . some of the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines . " we have to write our history books new , because what we thought was that the activities of the @entity7 ended at nine or 10 ( years ) after @entity22 , " said @entity15 , science minister for the @entity1 state of @entity17 . " now we know that it must be 200 or 250 after that . " for weeks , archeologist @entity25 and her team have been searching this area with metal detectors , pulling hundreds of ancient @entity7 weapons out of the ground . they paint a picture of a highly organized , technologically superior @entity7 army beset by germanic tribes in a forest about 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of the modern city of @entity37 . the hillside battlefield was discovered by relic - hunters illegally searching for souvenirs of more recent wars near the town of @entity43 . one of them brought some of the items he found to @entity25 , who works for the local government . the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines . watch how the battlefield discovery could re-write history » " we believe the @entity1 ambushed the @entity7 here , but the legions quickly fired back with catapults and archers -- and then it came to a massive man - on - man onslaught , " @entity25 said . the items unearthed so far include an axe , still sharp after nearly 1,800 years ; horseshoes ; shovels ; spearheads ; and dozens of arrowheads for a @entity66 , a cross between a catapult and a crossbow -- the ancient equivalent of artillery . " with a very high speed , on a very long distance -- about 300 meters -- you can hit targets precisely , " said @entity72 , of @entity37 's archeological institute . researchers say the evidence suggests the tribesmen lured the @entity7 into the forest to keep them from making full use of those long - range weapons and draw them into hand - to - hand combat , outside of the formations the imperial troops had mastered . however , they believe the @entity7 ultimately prevailed . other relics include coins depicting the late second - century roman emperor @entity90 , depicted in the @entity92 - winning @entity93 epic " gladiator " -- a film that opens with a scene of battle against a barbarian horde that scientists say appears to be largely accurate . and @entity25 said her team may have only begun to scratch the surface of the forest .

@entity249 : @placeholder 's @entity107 must prove able to restrain @entity4 when necessary	@entity101	( @entity0 ) -- the brief but bloody @entity2 conflict between @entity3 and @entity4 marks a clear wake - up call to both sides , and their supporters , on the indispensable need to start serious talks beyond the new cease - fire . this development must be seized upon to convert the recent crisis into an opportunity after years of inaction . a desperate injection of diplomatic energy is required . the alternative is renouncing responsibility and initiative to continuous unpredictability , and becoming its hostage . in an increasingly volatile region experiencing historic transformation and shifting alliances , the potential for simultaneous conflict on multiple fronts remains real . are you affected by the conflict ? share photos and video , but stay safe . diminishing the threat , and its catastrophic consequences , through a credible process is critical to regional stability and international order . the cease - fire alone simply marks the end of another chapter in the decades - old vicious cycle of violence between @entity3 and @entity42 . ideally , a next phase of negotiations should focus on a permanent end of hostilities . although its duration would be unknown , it is best to commence sooner rather than later . the regional status quo is simply unsustainable in the long - term . time is of the essence . a continuing game of brinksmanship risks miscalculation and another descent into the abyss at any given moment . after all , there is no military solution to the @entity3 - @entity42 conundrum . tallying the results of the recent conflict leaves adequate room for each side to claim points and some form of victory . however , neither could benefit from further escalation . for @entity3 , its @entity73 anti-missile defense system proved increasingly effective . its surgical strikes in @entity2 demonstrated greater accuracy . although no match for @entity3 's superior firepower , @entity4 's rockets reached alarmingly deeper into @entity3 territory . this provided a psychological boost to morale despite relentless @entity3 attacks and considerable physical damage . post-conflict reconstruction is nothing new : @entity4 will emerge politically strengthened at home and abroad and it will continue to overshadow @entity89 , which controls the @entity90 . the credibility of @entity42 president @entity92 is further undermined , even as he actively pursues non-member observer status for @entity42 at the @entity94 . the presence of intermediaries in @entity97 to negotiate the cease - fire reaffirms the centrality of @entity101 's role to any peace process . clearly , without @entity101 , no solutions are possible . for now , the cease - fire also marks the most important foreign policy test and achievement yet for new @entity101 president @entity107 . since @entity109 's ouster and its departure from @entity111 , @entity4 remains increasingly dependent upon @entity101 ideologically , politically , diplomatically and economically . throughout the week - long conflict , @entity107 skilfully influenced @entity4 . furthermore , sending @entity101 's prime minister to @entity2 at the very start of the crisis proved symbolically important , although practically ineffective . through the cease - fire , @entity107 has raised his standing at home and abroad . a process of establishing himself as a reliable regional broker has begun . however , responsible continuity and critical follow up is required . statements alone will not suffice . in concrete terms , he must prove able to restrain @entity4 when necessary and guide it on a constructive path toward peace . sustained diplomatic support from the @entity130 and @entity131 , and particularly financial assistance from @entity133 , will further strengthen @entity107 's hand . the increased leverage from positive crisis management must be used effectively by @entity107 at home . while he is developing a pragmatic accommodation with the military , serious concerns still linger for political opponents and minorities of his broader agenda . @entity107 must reach out beyond his political base and take a more inclusive approach . the crisis also underscored the need to strike a balance between public expectations , particularly in @entity151 ranks , and what is realistically achievable in the diplomatic realm . while in opposition during the @entity109 era , @entity154 scored easy points with public opinion when condemning government inaction during @entity3 - @entity42 violence . now the reality of power demands greater rhetorical responsibility and restraint from islamists in government . the current cease - fire also offers president @entity107 the opportunity for renewed , and closer , engagement with the @entity171 , particularly after president @entity173 's election victory and @entity107 's initial blunders following the killing of @entity171 's ambassador to @entity177 . with the @entity171 election over , the burden is also on president @entity173 to assume a more proactive role in fostering a productive peace process , in collaboration with allies and regional powers . @entity173 's first attempt immediately following his 2009 inauguration ended in humiliation at the hands of @entity3 prime minister @entity190 . although once bitten , @entity173 can not be twice shy . @entity171 national interests and international order can not afford it . with a drastically transforming @entity194 and in search for a foreign policy legacy , @entity173 must seize the historic opportunity for a new start . there is no room for reluctance or excessive caution . troubles with @entity204 and @entity111 can not be obstacles to a @entity42 state . furthermore , the growing perception of exclusive @entity171 interest in east @entity209 and neglect and indifference to the @entity194 is very destabilizing . it creates an increasingly dangerous power vacuum and encourages nefarious forces to fill it . @entity173 's penchant for re-start buttons should not lose focus on the @entity194 , and particularly @entity101 . approximately two months away from election , the cease - fire was the best possible outcome for @entity3 's @entity190 . he emerges politically stronger and brandishes his leadership credentials as the guarantor of @entity3 's security . averting a ground invasion was crucial . he exits the crisis with ample support in the @entity90 and avoided greater international isolation . however , the regional game has dramatically changed for all players . @entity190 no longer enjoys @entity109 's passive acquiescence in @entity101 or a reliably predictable enemy like president @entity233 in @entity111 . new realities require new approaches . failure to adapt will have considerable consequences for @entity190 and @entity3 . ultimately , a resolution to the @entity3 - @entity42 issue is not a panacea to the ills plaguing the broader @entity194 . however , it would provide indispensable momentum and unleash new dynamics in confronting other outstanding grievances around the region and beyond . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .	@entity111:Syria	@entity89:Fatah	@entity151:Islamist	@entity131:Turkey	@entity130:Arab League	@entity133:Qatar	@entity154:Islamists	@entity3:Israeli	@entity2:Gaza	@entity173:Obama	@entity0:CNN	@entity177:Libya	@entity4:Hamas	@entity194:Middle East	@entity190:Netanyahu	@entity90:West	@entity73:Iron Dome	@entity171:American	@entity233:Bashar al-Assad	@entity101:Egypt	@entity209:Asia	@entity107:Morsy	@entity97:Cairo	@entity109:Mubarak	@entity94:United Nations	@entity92:Mahmoud Abbas	@entity249:Vicenzino	@entity204:Iran	@entity42:Palestinian
writer 's goal : crash as many @placeholder , @entity13 parties as he can and blog about them	@entity38	@entity0 makes his way along @entity3 's secured streets , struggling to put on his tie and manage his monogrammed backpack at the same time . the 27 - year - old is on a mission : he 's looking for a party . not just any party . he works with the @entity10 , a nonpartisan , nonprofit group that advocates for greater government transparency . his goal at the @entity13 , as it was at the @entity15 ' confab in @entity16 : to crash as many parties as he can , then blog about them . since 2008 , his organization 's @entity19 website has been tracking exclusive , behind - the - scenes events where politicians and special interests meet , often out of the spotlight . the groups hosting these events , @entity25 says , hope to influence the outcome of the november elections -- as well as lawmakers ' votes in @entity32 and state capitols . by his count , there were at least 400 parties planned during the @entity13 and 200 during the @entity38 . " all the big players are at the conventions at once , " he says , " so it is sort of like being in the @entity44 party circuit on steroids . " tonight @entity25 decides to stop by @entity47 's " @entity46 " party first . the organization has been under recent attack from republicans in @entity32 who have repeatedly tried to shut off federal funding for the organization 's family planning efforts . the @entity56 , the group 's political arm and official host of the party , has spent nearly $ 2 million during this year 's election cycle -- most of it on negative ads against @entity15 , according to the @entity63 . while groups like @entity56 spend millions to elect @entity68 , groups like @entity66 work to put @entity15 in power . @entity25 has an issue with the laws that regulate these types of groups , because they 're not required to reveal the names of the donors who ultimately pay for those ads. " there is a real transparency issue here , " @entity25 says . @entity25 says he tried but failed to get into the @entity66 party in @entity16 . here in @entity3 he does n't have a ticket , but he sees a friend outside the @entity47 party who helps . he says he can usually talk his way into events . at his friend 's urging , security waves @entity25 and his @entity10 colleague @entity89 through . they even let them use the velvet - lined vip line to bypass the crowd . inside , smartly dressed older women sit in a line on comfortable couches , checking their email on smartphones . a man wearing an @entity104 ball cap orders a drink called " @entity106 " for his girlfriend . he 's having the " @entity108 . " a woman clutching one of the " we love @entity113 " banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances " @entity116 . " the giveaways here are simple and , in some cases , intended to provoke a laugh . condoms inside hot pink matchbook covers lay on low tables around the dance floor . the front of the package says " @entity127 in this election . " it 's an advertisement for @entity47 's women are watching website . " this party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base , " @entity25 says , as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows . " it 's not a party where you will rub shoulders with governors , and people are n't necessarily sowing the seeds for laws that will be written next year here like we 've seen at some of the super-elite parties , but it still is important , " @entity25 says . he pulls out a small @entity155 pad and takes notes as he talks to someone by the bar . the loud disco music suddenly fades away , and the emcee tells the excited crowd that two special guests have arrived . the floor goes wild as actress @entity164 stands in front of a hot pink " @entity46 " banner with @entity168 minority leader @entity167 at her side . " the @entity68 have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them , and @entity167 is a rock star among the @entity13 base , " @entity25 says . " @entity174 " during the conventions @entity167 talks about the @entity68 ' support for women 's issues -- among the convention themes earlier that evening -- then encourages the crowd to support the president . after @entity167 wraps up her speech , she does a little dance as the ' 70s hit " celebration " plays her loudly off the stage . she poses for photos with @entity47 leaders and other vips . people start to dance again . @entity190 , a political science professor at @entity191 who was in @entity3 to observe the convention , says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues . they are also mutually beneficial to the people who attend . " some will show up to these parties for nice swag or good food or to show their support for a particular political message , sure , " @entity190 said . " but it 's also aimed at the fledging county commission candidate who shows up at the convention . " the fact that @entity167 is there gives them a chance to take a picture with her and then tweet it out or put it on their @entity213 page . it gives them a certain type of credibility . it makes them look important , and they 'll remember an organization that made this happen . " @entity25 says there were several splashy events at the @entity38 . though fewer in number than at the @entity13 , the parties were equally high profile . at the @entity234 , scantily clad women dressed as mermaids floated in a tank as guests at the @entity233 party ordered drinks from multiple bars . in " a salute to the @entity168 and @entity239 , " attendees could shag balls and take batting practice at @entity242 for a charitable donation . a $ 15,000 donation got people into a private reception with former @entity234 gov. @entity247 , courtesy of the foundation for @entity234 's @entity250 . it 's midnight back in @entity3 before @entity25 and @entity252 head out past streams of other party - hoppers and make their way to a swank hotel near the convention center . the lobby has a different feel than the @entity47 party . well - dressed guests sit at a tiny table by the bar with a couple bottles of expensive @entity266 champagne . sen. @entity267 stands in the corner having a hushed but animated conversation with two equally tall men . and more people carrying " we love @entity113 " signs , now somewhat crushed , make their way toward the elevator . on the hotel 's second floor is " come together : a @entity278 " honoring the @entity279 . @entity25 does n't have an invitation here either , but he blends into the crowd to make his way into the fancy ballroom . the event invitations advertise the party 's sponsors . @entity25 says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor . @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 were among the hosts . @entity190 says some people may be uncomfortable with the role corporations play behind the scenes at such events , but she thinks they are necessary . " taking corporate funding for them is a double - edged sword since you do need someone to pay for it , " she says . " you do n't want to use public funds for a party . " that type of corporate sponsorship may suggest they have more influence than others with politicians , and some may take issue with it , but groups do n't have the money to do this on their own and they want to attract the right people to their events . " people wo n't show up if the party is boring . " men with lapel pins identifying them as state legislators or congressmen make their way into the party . @entity252 points out others wearing special pins she says are given to big @entity104 donors . @entity25 ignores the live band playing @entity338 's " @entity337 " and forgoes the red , white and blue macaroons . instead , he talks to people and takes notes . " this is more a top - flight party than @entity47 's , as the guest list is more exclusive and the food , drink and space itself is some of the most expensive i 've seen , " @entity25 explains later . he speaks with a county commissioner running for @entity32 and her husband , a lawyer at @entity349 -- another of the evening 's sponsors . the party , he says , " is about building relationships with people in business and the government . " @entity356 is a political ethics expert whose nonpartisan nonprofit , @entity358 , has teamed up with @entity25 's organization in the party monitoring enterprise at the convention . he worries these parties play an outsized role at conventions . " these conventions are supposed to be merely ... events to rally for these candidates , " @entity356 says . " but the lobbyists and special interest groups are indulging in a real habit of turning these conventions instead into lobby - fests . " @entity190 has a different perspective . " the conventions are really professional conferences , " she said , " and like most trade associations , networking is a big part of what you are doing here . " " yes , the delegates are here to nominate their candidate , but behind the scenes you have a lot of local candidates trying to make connections , meet potential fundraisers and backers . that may be more important to them than the activities you see on tv . it 's hard to develop a profile for yourself and a reputation if you do n't know anyone . " it 's past 1 a.m. when @entity25 leaves the party and heads off to another . he hears the actor and hip - hop artist @entity403 is performing at a party within driving distance . he 'd prefer not to stay out too late if possible ; he 's learned that a certain @entity406 is hosting a brunch at an undisclosed location in the morning . it 's supposed to be at a mansion , but he does n't know which one . at least not yet . puppet protesters pull no punches	@entity25:Steiner	@entity406:Super PAC	@entity403:Common	@entity250:Future	@entity116:The Electric Slide	@entity252:Bartolomeo	@entity338:James Brown	@entity113:Michelle	@entity358:Public Citizen	@entity278:Late Night Celebration	@entity279:National Black Caucus of State Legislators	@entity89:Liz Bartolomeo	@entity356:Holman	@entity337:Sex Machine	@entity155:Moleskine	@entity3:Charlotte	@entity233:Distilled Spirits Council	@entity0:Keenan Steiner	@entity174:Homocon	@entity234:Florida	@entity213:Facebook	@entity239:Senate Energy and Commerce Committees	@entity191:Emory University	@entity190:Gillespie	@entity56:Planned Parenthood Action Fund	@entity294:Waste Management	@entity295:Amerigroup	@entity296:Maximus	@entity297:VS2	@entity16:Tampa	@entity15:Republicans	@entity32:Congress	@entity13:DNC	@entity10:Sunlight Foundation	@entity38:RNC	@entity19:Political Party Time	@entity247:Jeb Bush	@entity104:Obama	@entity242:Tropicana Field	@entity106:Safe Sex Champagne	@entity349:McGuireWoods	@entity108:Obamatini	@entity127:Protect Yourself From Romney & Ryan	@entity267:John Kerry	@entity266:Veuve Clicquot	@entity167:Pelosi	@entity164:Ashley Judd	@entity168:House	@entity44:Washington	@entity46:Sex , Politics	@entity47:Planned Parenthood	@entity68:Democrats	@entity66:Americans for Prosperity	@entity63:Center for Responsive Politics

@placeholder is guiding a team building a bio-drone that can self - destruct and leave no trace if it crashes	@entity7	a bio-drone that dissolves after use leaving no trace it ever existed may sound like the stuff of a @entity6 film , but @entity7 and a team of researchers are actually building one . made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers and cloned paper wasp spit , the drone might resemble a propeller - powered egg carton , but its designers say it has the ability to fly into environmentally sensitive areas and leave almost no trace . @entity21 , the @entity7 developer guiding students from @entity24 - @entity23 working on the project , says the drone could be made to disappear simply by ditching it into a stream or puddle . she said her interest in unmanned aerial vehicles was sparked by work on environmentally sensitive areas in her @entity35 group at @entity7 . " periodically , uavs get lost -- for example on coral reefs or in other sensitive habitats , " she said in an interview with the project team . " as i started to hear about this , i thought , ' well , would n't it be useful if the @entity38 was biodegradable , so if it crashed somewhere that was sensitive , it would n't matter if it dissolved . " the mushroom - like substance known as mycelium , which makes up the chassis of the drone , is being hailed as the new plastic -- a plastic that has the advantage of degrading quickly . the team grew cellulose " leather " to coat the fungal body of the flying craft and then covered the sheets with proteins sourced from the saliva of paper wasps -- a water resistant material that the insects use to cover their nests . the circuits are printed from silver nanoparticle ink in an effort to make the machine as biodegradable as possible . despite a heavy preponderance of biological parts , the team said the project had its limits . " there are definitely parts that ca n't be replaced by biology , " said @entity24 's @entity70 . at its first short flight at the @entity76 competition in @entity77 , the team used a standard battery , motor and propellers to fly the drone . nevertheless , the team is working on making other parts biodegradable and is studying how to build its sensors from modified e. coli bacteria , the bacteria most commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals . the team said that ultimately the drone could be sent into areas where it might not be expected to return such as wildfires or nuclear accidents , sending data and never coming back . while the parts degrade naturally , the team also experimented with enzymes that would help the drone self - destruct , breaking it down further on impact . creating a drone that does not infect the environment has been another challenge for the team . " if you have living organisms acting as biosensors and the plane crashes , there certainly could be problems as the plane interacts with the environment , " @entity100 said . " hopefully people could think of this in advance , and design such that this never becomes a problem . " for example , on crashing , the cells might die . or the cells could be attenuated . there are all sorts of other processes to keep them from contaminating the environment . but that , to me , is the largest concern with a biological @entity38 - having living things on the uav .

fans came down pro or con ; many are concerned about @placeholder ' " @entity21 " ties	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- how times have changed . more than 30 years ago , @entity2 was announced as the director of " @entity4 , " the first sequel to " @entity6 . " @entity2 was a curious choice -- a director of documentaries , star vehicles and tv episodes -- but in the days before the @entity12 , the announcement raised hardly a fuss . on the other hand , last week @entity14 -- a seemingly unimpeachable choice , with his producing , directing and writing experiences on " @entity18 , " " @entity19 , " " @entity20 " and the rebooted " @entity21 " -- was announced as the director of the forthcoming " @entity24 " and the world went nuts . " another franchise for him to ruin , " a reader named " hey " wrote on @entity0 's @entity28 blog . " lost sucked , cloverfield sucked and now the new star wars movies are going to suck worse than the last 3 , " added screen name " horrible pick . " whew . can you imagine what kind of reaction @entity2 would have gotten ? " there would have been blood in the water , " says @entity41 , a pop - culture blogger who puts out a weekly podcast called @entity45 ! but that 's the world we live in now , says @entity48 , a self - described " fan - scholar " who teaches at @entity50 in @entity51 . " what i find so interesting is , when you talk about the online , 24 - hour news cycle , you have these knee - jerk responses . it 's panic , " she says . " it shows the power and pervasiveness of fan culture . " @entity41 understands the concern . " in the annals of geek history , there 's always been the argument : which one is better , ' @entity6 ' or ' @entity21 ' ? and until this point , we 've never had a director sit down and do both of them , " he says . " this is the first time , where we will literally have somebody who 's played both sides of the field , and i think a lot of nerds and geeks are a little bit terrified of that . " after 100 episodes , ' @entity19 ' cast bids farewell @entity82 2.0 since getting the job -- after initial reports he was n't interested -- @entity14 has at least said all the right things . " to be a part of the next chapter of the ' @entity6 ' saga ... is an absolute honor , " @entity14 said in a statement released by @entity87 , which owns @entity82 ' production company @entity88 . " i may be even more grateful to @entity82 now than i was as a kid . " moreover , @entity82 has given his blessing . " i 've consistently been impressed with @entity14 as a filmmaker and storyteller , " @entity82 said . " he 's an ideal choice to direct the new ' @entity6 ' film , and the legacy could n't be in better hands . " certainly @entity14 would seem a logical selection . he 's kind of a " @entity82 2.0 , " with his producing , directing and writing experience . " hate him or love him , here 's a guy who 's worked in multiple genres across multiple media and has his own production company -- which is way more established than @entity82 was when ' @entity6 ' came out , " says @entity109 , a film professor at the @entity110 . it 's good to be @entity14 @entity14 says the original 1977 film left a lasting impression on him . " as a kid i was always a fan of special effects , " he told @entity114 in november . " watching movies i was constantly trying to figure out how they did it , whatever the effect was . ' @entity6 ' was the first movie that blew my mind in that way . " he added , " it galvanized for me ; not for what was exciting about how movies were made , but rather for what movies were capable of . " " @entity6 , " of course , has been capable of quite a lot . the first film invented the modern sci - fi blockbuster , observes @entity109 , and helped redefine @entity133 's movie - going habits . and over the years , the " @entity6 " universe has spawned books , television shows , video games , parodies and -- above all -- an array of merchandise that has given the fans themselves control over the story . it 's the reason there 's such anger when @entity82 , whose empire rests on " @entity6 ' " foundation , decides to assert his authorship over the scriptures -- whether it 's maintaining that @entity150 was n't a cold - blooded murderer ( " @entity150 shot first ! " goes a common refrain among fans , noting that the smuggler played by @entity161 actually shot the bounty hunter @entity162 unchallenged ) or creates a character such as @entity153 , the goofy , child - friendly @entity154 who was called a " @entity157 " by film critic @entity156 . in response to the annoyance with @entity166 , one fan created a @entity168 version that 's come to be known as " @entity169 . " @entity170 says she believes the conflict arises from the " old - media " @entity82 clashing with a savvy , @entity174 fan base . " @entity82 had an analog approach -- ' it 's mine , i can do whatever i want , ' " she says . " it 's almost borderline hostile . " the fans , on the other hand , have already taken " @entity6 " places @entity82 never imagined , and they were n't shy about expressing their dismay with the second trilogy of films , all of which were written and directed by @entity82 . there 's something " organic " about " @entity6 , " says @entity170 , and @entity82 tampered with that feeling when he made the newer films -- particularly thanks to his sometimes ham - fisted screenwriting . " the ( second trilogy ) also feels synthetic in terms of plot , " says @entity170 , " and most fans blame lucas the screenwriter for that . " bridging worlds the fans are n't the only ones . the general consensus on the first film 's script , also written by @entity82 , was best summed up by @entity161 , who famously told the writer - director , " @entity82 , you can type this s * * * , but you sure as hell ca n't say it . " the scripts improved for the second and third films , " @entity4 " and " @entity216 , " thanks to the participation of writers @entity214 and @entity215 . @entity41 believes " @entity24 , " which will feature a script by " @entity218 " and " @entity219 " screenwriter @entity220 , will make the new movie a must - see for fans as much as @entity14 ' involvement will . " [ @entity220 ] likes to develop characters , and that 's something that @entity14 is also well - known for doing , " he says . " if you look at the prequels , which a lot of fans malign , it 's because of that special attention that was n't given to ( the characters ) . " the new movie also gives the franchise a chance to reach a new generation -- something that was undoubtedly on @entity87 's mind when the studio purchased @entity88 last year for $ 4 billion . @entity41 foresees more synergy with @entity87 's theme parks ; @entity109 sees an opportunity to make the post- " @entity6 " generation excited about the franchise , perhaps for the first time . ' @entity244 delayed @entity109 has noticed that his current students , who were born in the early ' 90s , no longer find " @entity6 " a touchstone . " for them , there 's less specialness because the ripple effect of ' @entity6 ' had already taken hold , " he says . for these under - 25s , the new film is " about extending the life of the brand , because it does n't have a life right now . " and @entity14 , the master of the reboot -- besides " @entity21 , " he also directed " mission : @entity261 " -- may be just the guy to do it . at the very least , says @entity41 , he and @entity220 can provide a counterweight to @entity82 and give " @entity24 " a different attitude , with more fun and depth than the second trilogy had . after all , that 's what @entity2 and @entity214 did with " @entity269 , " which is widely considered the best of the six " @entity6 " films . " as much as i love the idea of @entity82 and all of his crazy concepts , he is at his best when someone else is realizing his vision for him , " he says . " @entity269 " has that imprint , he says . so do the novelizations , comic books and video games . regardless of what the future brings , @entity170 is trying to relax . the news about @entity14 and @entity220 has helped , but she 's been burned before . " i 'm always going to keep my guard up , ever since the prequels , " she says . perhaps the @entity269 is listening this time .	@entity20:Super 8	@entity21:Star Trek	@entity24:Star Wars VII	@entity28:Marquee	@entity87:Disney	@entity153:Jar Jar Binks	@entity82:George Lucas	@entity114:Entertainment Weekly	@entity170:Scott	@entity110:University of Michigan	@entity88:Lucasfilm	@entity150:Han	@entity157:Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit	@entity156:Joe Morgenstern	@entity133:America	@entity154:Gungan	@entity214:Kasdan	@entity215:Leigh Brackett	@entity216:Return of the Jedi	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Star Wars	@entity4:Empire Strikes Back	@entity218:Little Miss Sunshine	@entity219:Toy Story 3	@entity51:Los Angeles	@entity50:Occidental College	@entity14:Abrams	@entity12:Internet	@entity2:Kershner	@entity19:Fringe	@entity18:Lost	@entity244:Star Wars ' Episodes II and III in 3-D	@entity269:Empire	@entity109:Herbert	@entity261:Impossible 3	@entity174:post-Internet	@entity162:Greedo	@entity220:Arndt	@entity161:Harrison Ford	@entity166:Binks	@entity168:Jar Jar-less	@entity169:The Phantom Edit	@entity45:Shauncastic	@entity41:Rosado	@entity48:Suzanne Scott
@placeholder : " i do believe in modesty and you should n't be showing off yourself "	@entity10	editor 's note : this is part of a series of reports @entity5 is featuring from an upcoming , six - hour television event , " @entity7 , " hosted by @entity5 chief international correspondent @entity8 . @entity9 of @entity10 says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty . ( @entity5 ) -- last year at @entity14 , @entity15 , a @entity16 living in @entity17 , went to pick up some things at a local @entity19 . seeing her distinctive traditional @entity16 head covering called a " hijab , " a man in the store , addressing her directly , sang " the @entity28 " using insulting lyrics about terrorism and @entity27 . she was stunned . " do i look like a terrorist to you ? " @entity15 said she asked the man . according to @entity33 , the man replied , " what else does a terrorist look like ? " such stories are not altogether uncommon for @entity37 . according to a recent poll by the @entity40 , 53 percent of @entity16 living in @entity38 said it has become more difficult to be a muslim in the @entity38 since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . fifty - one percent said they are " very worried " or " somewhat worried " that women wearing the hijab are treated poorly , according to the poll . a simple headscarf generally used by women to hide the hair from view , the hijab has become so controversial among some that several countries have banned or considered banning @entity16 women from wearing them in public places . in light of this contentiousness , why do @entity16 women choose to wear the hijab ? watch the making of @entity5 's tv special " @entity7 " » @entity9 lives in @entity10 and says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty . " i want to shift the attention from my outer self to my inner self when i deal with someone , i do n't want them to look at me in a way that would n't suit me , " she told @entity5 in an upcoming documentary called " @entity7 . " @entity70 is fluent in @entity71 and @entity72 ; studied in @entity73 ; plays @entity75 music on her guitar ; and spent time working for a women 's rights organization . she wears the hijab -- and says it 's not just for religious reasons . " my own conclusion was it is debatable whether it is a religious obligation or not , but i chose to keep it on because i do believe in modesty and you should n't be showing off yourself , " @entity81 said . the quran calls for women to be modest in their dress but interpretation of the edict varies widely , according to religious experts who spoke with @entity5 . an author who has written widely on @entity94 told @entity5 the @entity87 does not require women to wear the hijab . " there 's nothing in the @entity87 about all women having to be veiled or secluded in a certain part of the house . that came in later [ after @entity104 's time ] , " said religious historian and author @entity100 . for @entity33 , the hijab is a religious duty . " it 's @entity109 's wish , " she said . " it 's a requirement by @entity109 . he wants us to cover . he wants us to be modest , " @entity15 said . but as important as the hijab is to her , @entity33 's decision to cover her hair was n't one she made easily . " it was very dramatic for me . and i remember , even now thinking about it , it really does make my heart beat a little bit faster , " she said , " i was making a decision i knew was permanent . you put on hijab , you do n't take it off . " through her childhood growing up in @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity33 prayed with her devout @entity16 parents , but says she was just " going through the motions . " it was n't until college that she decided to wear a hijab consistently . influenced by her more devout friends , @entity33 decided being a good @entity16 meant covering her head . " my sole purpose is to be here for the sake of @entity147 , and i 'm doing something that he specifically says that you should be doing . " @entity15 said there were practical factors in her decision as well . " i 'm sick of guys catcalling . it was just driving me crazy . i felt like a piece of meat . " but @entity15 says she traded in catcalling for a different kind of negative attention . people " look at me as if i am threatening and i do not feel like i am threatening looking . i do n't feel i should instill fear in anybody 's heart , but i do feel like i get dirty looks , " she said . still , @entity33 says her faith sustains her and that wearing the hijab is an important part of that faith . " i 'm not here to live my life and do whatever i want . i 'm here to worship @entity109 , " @entity15 said . " i do n't think that everybody has that , and i think that i 'm lucky for it .

0 victory that left @entity6 in the relegation zone . @entity9 's team bounced back from last weekend 's goalless draw at @entity11 to put the onus on title rivals @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 . @entity15 travel to @entity14 on sunday , while @entity16 face a potentially tricky clash with @entity19 in the club 's first match since @entity23 striker @entity22 -- who is sidelined with injury -- made a surprise turnaround and decided to sign a new five - year contract after threatening to leave . @entity1 faced a @entity28 team who had not won since the opening day of the season , but made hard work of the victory after taking the lead in the 23rd minute . @entity35 helped @entity36 -- his fellow goalscorer in the midweek @entity38 win over @entity39 -- set up @entity41 winger @entity40 for the opener . the visitors belied their lowly league position and squandered several chances to equalize , coming closest when halftime substitute @entity47 's header was cleared off the line by @entity49 . @entity47 was booed when he came on the pitch by the home fans , who have still not forgiven him for the collision that left @entity1 goalkeeper @entity54 with a fractured skull four years ago . @entity56 replaced @entity40 with 18 minutes to play , and the @entity57 forward made it 2 - 0 on 81 when he finished off a series of passes involving him , @entity49 and @entity61 , who returned from injury to lead the attack . @entity64 moved up to third place with a 1 - 1 home draw against @entity67 in saturday 's early kick - off , after @entity70 's first - half strike equaled @entity72 ' goal for the visitors . defender @entity72 put @entity75 ' men ahead at @entity76 in the 17th minute with a deftly - struck left - foot free - kick that sailed into the top right - hand corner from the edge of the area , but the advantage proved to be short - lived . @entity64 , who made three changes to the side who lost 4 - 3 to @entity86 in the @entity38 in midweek , equalized three minutes later . capitalizing on a defensive mix - up between @entity67 goalkeeper @entity88 and @entity89 from a deep cross , @entity70 celebrated his return from @entity93 suspension to slot home his fourth of the season on 19 minutes when the ball fell at his feet just yards from the goal line . @entity67 looked to have greater energy as the game progressed though @entity102 , who had managed well as @entity67 's only forward , was replaced with @entity41 striker @entity104 after sustaining an injury . the move prompted @entity64 manager @entity107 to shuffle his pack and introduce the presence of striker @entity110 in place of speedy winger @entity112 , as both sides gambled for the win . promoted @entity115 joined @entity64 on 15 points with a 2 - 1 victory at home to @entity119 , moving up to fourth place ahead of @entity15 and @entity16 . @entity122 's team , had to come from behind after @entity123 could only push @entity125 's ninth - minute effort onto the post -- and the ball bounced back off the former @entity23 goalkeeper and into the net . but @entity131 midfielder @entity130 leveled eight minutes later after collecting @entity133 's throughball and beating keeper @entity134 . striker @entity135 made it 2 - 1 five minutes before halftime with a cool finish after winger @entity139 cut the ball back from the byline . @entity119 boss @entity142 brought on former @entity23 striker @entity143 for his first appearance since january , but his team could not equalize and have now not won away since the opening day in august . @entity147 moved up to seventh place after beating @entity11 1 - 0 to end a run of five successive draws , as @entity152 's first - half own - goal proved the difference between the teams . the @entity156 defender could only divert @entity159 midfielder @entity158 's 25th - minute cross into his own net , and @entity11 earlier saw winger @entity161 hit the post and striker @entity163 completely miskicked in front of goal in the second half . @entity147 have scored just 11 times in nine league matches -- seven from @entity23 striker @entity169 , two from record signing @entity170 , and two own - goals . @entity173 joined @entity147 on 12 points with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity176 , who moved above @entity119 into 14th place . @entity176 took the lead just before the hour mark through @entity182 striker @entity181 , but @entity184 forward @entity183 leveled in the 66th minute . @entity185 moved up to 12th place with a 2 - 0 win over @entity188 , who also have 10 points along with @entity67 , @entity19 and @entity176 . defender @entity191 scored @entity185 's first home goal since august 21 in the 36th minute , nodding in from close range after @entity194 headed against the crossbar . the giant @entity197 striker scored his second goal in successive matches 10 minutes after the halftime break when @entity188 could not clear @entity191 's cross . @entity202 won 2 - 1 at bottom club @entity203 in the late match to move above @entity11 on goal difference , with young striker @entity206 netting a 68th - minute winner for his fifth league goal this season . @entity203 went ahead in the 12th minute through striker @entity210 's first of the campaign , but visiting captain @entity212 leveled 10 minutes later .	@entity22:Wayne Rooney	@entity23:England	@entity169:Darren Bent	@entity28:Wolves	@entity135:Marc-Antoine Fortune	@entity115:West Brom	@entity158:Steed Malbranque	@entity139:Jerome Thomas	@entity112:Aaron Lennon	@entity86:Inter Milan	@entity110:Roman Pavlyuchenko	@entity88:Tim Howard	@entity89:Phil Neville	@entity131:Congo	@entity130:Youssouf Mulumbu	@entity119:Fulham	@entity170:Asamoah Gyan	@entity1:Chelsea	@entity0:CNN	@entity210:Carlton Cole	@entity6:Wolverhampton	@entity212:Kevin Nolan	@entity176:Wigan	@entity197:Serbia	@entity93:European	@entity9:Carlo Ancelotti	@entity194:Nikola Zigic	@entity191:Ridgewell	@entity156:Republic of Ireland	@entity41:France	@entity57:Ivory Coast	@entity133:Chris Brunt	@entity54:Petr Cech	@entity75:David Moyes	@entity76:White Hart Lane	@entity70:Van der Vaart	@entity56:Salomon Kalou	@entity16:Manchester United	@entity15:Arsenal	@entity14:Manchester City	@entity35:Nicolas Anelka	@entity11:Villa	@entity36:Yuri Zhirkov	@entity39:Spartak Moscow	@entity38:Champions League	@entity147:Sunderland	@entity173:Bolton	@entity19:Stoke	@entity102:Yakubu	@entity152:Richard Dunne	@entity104:Louis Saha	@entity123:Scott Carson	@entity107:Harry Redknapp	@entity203:West Ham	@entity202:Newcastle	@entity125:Zoltan Gera	@entity122:Roberto Di Matteo	@entity206:Andy Carroll	@entity188:Blackpool	@entity163:Emile Heskey	@entity161:Stewart Downing	@entity4:English Premier League	@entity142:Mark Hughes	@entity143:Andy Johnson	@entity181:Hugo Rodallega	@entity182:Colombia	@entity183:Johan Elmander	@entity184:Sweden	@entity185:Birmingham	@entity47:Hunt	@entity40:Malouda	@entity134:Mark Schwarzer	@entity159:French	@entity67:Everton	@entity64:Tottenham	@entity72:Baines	@entity49:Essien	@entity61:Didier Drogba

@entity4 defended the execution in a statement issued by the @placeholder embassy in @entity20	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity2 government condemned @entity4 's execution of a @entity2 national tuesday on drug smuggling charges . " i ... am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted , " prime minister @entity6 said . " i am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken . " @entity11 was convicted of carrying up to 4 kilograms ( 8.8 pounds ) of heroin at the @entity13 in september 2007 . according to @entity4 law , 50 grams ( 1.76 ounces ) is the threshold for the death penalty . @entity4 defended the execution in a statement issued by the @entity19 in @entity20 . " drug trafficking is a grave crime worldwide , " the statement said . " the concerns of the @entity2 side have been duly noted and taken into consideration by the @entity4 judicial authorities in the legal process , and mr. @entity11 's rights and interests under @entity4 law are properly respected and guaranteed . " the 53 - year - old is the first @entity32 executed in @entity4 in 50 years , according to the @entity2 legal group @entity33 . the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity2 , @entity35 , was summoned to the @entity34 in the hours following @entity11 's execution , the @entity34 told @entity0 . the ambassador was set to meet @entity38 , minister of state . " i had a difficult conversation with the @entity4 ambassador today , " @entity38 said in a statement following the meeting . " i made clear that the execution of mr. @entity11 was totally unacceptable and that @entity4 had failed in its basic human rights responsibilities in this case , in particular that @entity4 's court had not considered the representations made about mr. @entity11 's mental condition . " " we are deeply saddened , stunned and disappointed at the news of the execution of our beloved cousin , @entity56 , " @entity49 and @entity50 said in a statement issued on behalf of the family . " this was carried out this morning despite repeated requests for clemency and a proper appraisal of @entity56 's mental state . " his family and the @entity2 government had asked @entity4 leaders for clemency . his supporters argued that @entity11 was mentally ill , and that @entity4 officials did not take his mental condition into account when trying him . @entity11 's advocates say he suffered from a bipolar disorder and that he was tricked into carrying heroin into @entity4 with promises of a career as a pop singer . " the @entity76 condemns in the strongest terms the execution of @entity11 , " the @entity76 presidency said in a statement . " it deeply regrets the fact that @entity4 has not heeded the repeated calls by the @entity76 and one of its member states for the death sentence passed against mr. @entity11 to be commuted . " the @entity76 remains opposed to capital punishment , the statement said . @entity6 raised @entity11 's case with @entity4 premier @entity89 during the international climate summit in @entity91 earlier this month . @entity2 foreign secretary @entity92 echoed @entity6 's concerns about the execution . " the @entity2 is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances , " @entity92 said . " however , i also deeply regret the fact that our specific concerns about the individual in this case were not taken into consideration . ... these included mental health issues , and inadequate professional interpretation during the trial . " @entity108 , legal director with @entity33 , condemned the execution . " the death of @entity11 is a sad indictment of today 's world , and particularly of @entity4 's legal system , " she said . " @entity56 was a gentle man who suffered from a tormenting illness ... and was betrayed and deliberately killed by one of the most powerful nations on @entity117 . " before the execution , @entity118 , the @entity120 special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions , said it would be a " major step backwards for @entity4 " to execute a mentally ill man . " both @entity4 and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty , " @entity118 said in a statement released by @entity33 . @entity4 expressed hope that the case would not affect the relationship between the two nations . " we value the @entity4 - @entity2 relationship , " said @entity136 , a @entity137 spokeswoman . " so we hope the @entity2 authority can treat this matter rationally and not let it create new barrier between the two countries . i have emphasized that this is an independent criminal case . it has nothing to do with anything else .

@placeholder prosecutors receive police file in case regarding @entity4 captain @entity3	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's @entity1 is considering whether to charge @entity4 international footballer @entity3 with racist abuse after receiving a full police file on the @entity8 captain . @entity10 's @entity9 confirmed this week that @entity3 was questioned under caution last friday over claims that he abused @entity13 of @entity14 during a match in october . the 30 - year - old has strongly denied the accusation , but faces investigations by both the police and the @entity20 . he has continued to play for both club and country , including this month 's friendly win against @entity24 when he retained the captain 's armband . " we now have a full file on @entity3 and that is now under consideration , " a spokesman for the @entity1 confirmed to @entity0 on thursday . @entity3 's case is one of two that have rocked @entity35 football in recent months , and came shortly before @entity37 president @entity36 told @entity0 that there is no problem with on - pitch racism . @entity43 's @entity42 striker @entity41 has been charged by the @entity20 over allegedly racist remarks he made to @entity48 's @entity47 - born @entity46 international @entity45 during a @entity50 match on october 15 . @entity43 announced that @entity41 would plead his innocence .	@entity20:FA	@entity24:Sweden	@entity13:Anton Ferdinand	@entity3:John Terry	@entity2:UK	@entity1:Crown Prosecution Service	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:England	@entity9:Metropolitan Police	@entity8:Chelsea	@entity10:London	@entity50:Premier League	@entity14:QPR	@entity35:English	@entity37:FIFA	@entity36:Sepp Blatter	@entity45:Patrice Evra	@entity46:France	@entity47:Senegal	@entity41:Suarez	@entity42:Uruguayan	@entity43:Liverpool	@entity48:Manchester United
@entity170 says @placeholder has been inconsistent on the immigration issue	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- responding angrily to a campaign ad from @entity5 accusing him of being anti-immigrant , @entity3 insisted during last week 's @entity7 debate at the @entity8 in @entity9 that he has no problem with immigrants . perhaps not . but the dishonest and cynical way in which the former governor of @entity14 has dealt with the immigration issue on the campaign trail shows that he has a problem being consistent . in @entity20 , @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity3 attacked @entity22 gov. @entity21 and former house speaker @entity5 for immigration proposals that @entity3 said amounted to " amnesty " for illegal immigrants . but last week , in @entity1 , where @entity27 account for 22.5 percent of the population , we caught a glimpse of a kinder and gentler @entity3 . he told the @entity30 , a center - right group , that he would create a " temporary worker permit " for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity33 . however , @entity3 said , when the permit expires , workers would n't be forced to leave the @entity33 . instead , they would decide their next move themselves depending on their job prospects . his hope is that , at this point , many illegal immigrants would simply " self - deport . " good luck with that . like former @entity44 sen. @entity43 used to say : " there is nothing more permanent than a temporary worker . " people fall in love . they get married . they have children . and it becomes harder to remove them , even if we wanted to . besides , it 's not clear that @entity3 wants to remove anyone . the idea of voluntary deportation is absurd . i bet none of this is going over very well with the voters in the first three primary states who cast their lots for @entity3 , thinking he was going to be tough on illegal immigration only to find out that he does n't even have the stomach to forcibly deport undocumented immigrants . maybe @entity3 should ask president @entity69 for pointers . the @entity69 administration has deported more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants and offers no apologies . meanwhile , in a telenovela unique to the @entity1 primary , a group of @entity75 who supports @entity3 called on @entity79 to yank a commercial labeling the frontrunner " anti-immigrant . " a similar request came from @entity1 sen. @entity84 , who while not endorsing @entity3 , defended him against the charge that he was anti-immigrant . who does @entity84 think he is ? his own history with the immigration issue is spotty at best . in 2011 , @entity84 joined rep. @entity89 of @entity22 in his efforts to require businesses to participate in a government - run " e-verify " program which is supposed to tell them if a social security number is authentic . @entity84 also supports the @entity98 immigration law -- and presumably others like it around the country -- which forces local and state law officials to enforce federal immigration statutes . in addition , he opposes the @entity105 , which would give legal status to illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military because he considers it " part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty . " last week , in a good speech to the @entity30 , @entity84 acknowledged that many @entity7 -- including himself -- have been slow to condemn anti-immigrant rhetoric from other @entity7 . still , i do n't care what @entity84 says . @entity3 has , in this campaign , advanced a tone that is " anti-immigrant . " it was @entity3 who -- bringing back a tactic he used in 2008 against @entity98 sen. @entity123 -- painted @entity21 as soft on illegal immigration . @entity3 attacked @entity21 for signing a bill in the @entity22 that allowed undocumented students to attend state colleges and universities and pay in - state tuition rates . the narrative that @entity3 pushed was simple : " illegal immigrants are takers . they take advantage of in - state tuition rates . they take spots in university campuses that should go to @entity33 citizens . they take , take , and take some more . " never did @entity3 mention all that illegal immigrants contribute to society -- by paying taxes , increasing productivity , creating competition , and doing jobs that @entity33 wo n't do . later , with @entity21 vanquished into the single digits , @entity3 used the same line of attack against @entity79 , accusing him of advocating a kind of amnesty for illegal immigrants after @entity79 said that he wanted to provide undocumented workers with a " red card " that allowed them to work legally in the country . @entity3 accused @entity79 of letting illegal immigrants take jobs from @entity33 workers . now as he competes this week for @entity27 votes in @entity1 -- and , on feb 4 , in @entity158 , where @entity75 account for 26.5 percent of the population -- @entity3 must be hoping that @entity75 have bad memories . we do n't . we never forget a slight . and , in that respect , @entity3 has given us plenty to remember . follow @entity164 on @entity165 join the conversation on @entity167 the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity170	@entity22:Lone Star State	@entity20:Iowa	@entity21:Perry	@entity27:Hispanic	@entity158:Nevada	@entity84:Rubio	@entity89:Lamar Smith	@entity3:Romney	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Florida	@entity0:Miami	@entity7:Republicans	@entity5:Newt Gingrich	@entity9:Jacksonville	@entity8:University of North Florida	@entity79:Gingrich	@entity75:Latinos	@entity30:Hispanic Leadership Network	@entity33:American	@entity14:Massachusetts	@entity170:Navarrette	@entity69:Obama	@entity19:South Carolina	@entity18:New Hampshire	@entity105:DREAM Act	@entity98:Arizona	@entity123:John McCain	@entity167:Facebook	@entity164:CNN Opinion	@entity165:Twitter	@entity44:Wyoming	@entity43:Al Simpson
@placeholder finance minister : ' i do n't see ' any further eurozone bailouts	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 finance minister @entity1 says the eurozone 's problems are not solved , but " we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago . " asked whether he foresaw any further bailouts coming , he replied : " no , no i do n't see . " in a rare interview , conducted in @entity8 , he said : " if chancellor @entity9 ( is ) reelected i am confident that we will continue to work for a stronger @entity11 -- that 's our general position . we do n't want a @entity2 @entity11 but we want a strong @entity11 and that means every member state including @entity2 has to increase its competitiveness , " @entity1 said . " a stronger @entity11 means that everyone has to do its duty and not to ask for more money by others -- that 's the wrong way to get a strong @entity11 , that 's the wrong incentive . " his comments come ahead of the september 22 election , as @entity9 faces a @entity2 electorate weary of @entity11 's largest economy helping to bail out troubled eurozone nations , whose debt woes have threatened the stability of the currency . @entity32 , along with three other eurozone countries -- @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 -- remain dependent on rescue loans from the @entity38 and @entity39 ( @entity39 ) . the 17 - nation eurozone has emerged from its longest ever recession , growing 0.3 % in the second quarter after 18 months of contraction . unemployment rates remain high , but worries that the debt crisis could spread to larger economies such as @entity46 and @entity47 -- which both saw borrowing costs climb dangerously high last year -- have abated . " you can see if you look at the rates for sovereign debts they are stable . markets have confidence in the stability of the eurozone as a whole . and economies are recovering in the whole of the eurozone and the average deficit has been halved in all member states of the eurozone in the last three years . " @entity1 acknowledged that @entity32 will need further assistance , but said there will be no further " hair cuts " -- such as 100 billion euros in losses @entity32 debt holders were forced to incur last year -- for @entity32 or any other eurozone nation . @entity1 : enthusiastic and on campaign trail @entity0 's @entity71 and @entity72 contributed this this report	@entity2:German	@entity1:Schaeuble	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Ireland	@entity34:Portugal	@entity11:Europe	@entity36:Cyprus	@entity39:IMF	@entity38:EU	@entity9:Angela Merkel	@entity8:English	@entity46:Spain	@entity32:Greece	@entity47:Italy	@entity71:Nina dos Santos	@entity72:Irene Chapple

" and even before the @entity13 talks ' extension was announced , @entity6 secretary of state @entity30 and @entity7 foreign minister @entity31 signaled their intent to meet again : on september 24 in @entity35 on the sidelines of the @entity37 . the prospect of yet another round of negotiations in the next few weeks pointed to a potentially bigger endgame for the @entity6 and @entity7 in the hastily arranged meeting they began on thursday in the @entity45 city . that 's not to say all of the many outstanding issues -- on @entity5 's chemical weapons and much more -- have been resolved . senior @entity6 administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified the main sticking point was what consequences @entity17 and his government should face . these officials have no expectations @entity7 would agree to any @entity37 resolution that included authorization for possible military force against @entity5 . the @entity6 , therefore , will not insist it be included . that runs counter to @entity26 's call for the international community to take action , including a potential military strike , for what the @entity6 and allies call a chemical weapons attack by @entity17 's forces last month outside @entity5 's capital that they say killed more than 1,400 people . @entity26 has threatened to act alone , if necessary , and his administration credits that threat with @entity7 's surprise proposal last week to have @entity5 turn over its chemical weapons arsenal to international control . outside of the @entity78 , however , administration officials insisted they would not take the military threat off the table . a senior defense official said there has been " no change " in the military 's planning or readiness levels and commanders have not been instructed to change their " posture " in any way . chemical weapons report expected monday the @entity78 -- and especially its @entity91 , including permanent members the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 -- could play a key role in the international community 's response to @entity5 . and a report by its inspectors looking into an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity102 could be pivotal in guiding where countries come down on the issue . @entity37 secretary - general @entity107 is expected to present the report to the @entity91 at 11 a.m. monday , three diplomatic sources said . @entity107 said friday that he believes it " will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used . " the big questions are by whom and , if that 's settled , what the world should do about it . @entity118 and other @entity5 officials have vehemently denied their forces were responsible , despite assertions by @entity26 and others to the contrary . @entity7 has stood by its longtime ally @entity5 , challenging the validity of the @entity6 claims . at the same time , and as the threat of @entity6 - led strikes loomed , @entity15 raised its proposal on @entity5 's chemical weapons stockpiles and working through the @entity37 -- this after , time and again , blocking @entity37 action involving @entity5 . @entity118 quickly agreed , leading to the talks between @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity13 that began thursday . @entity5 also told the @entity78 on thursday that it has sent the paperwork for joining the @entity135 , which bans such armaments . the @entity5 submission was being reviewed by @entity37 lawyers . if deemed sufficient , secretary - general ban ki - moon would register it and @entity5 would officially be a member state in the convention . @entity37 envoy : @entity6 - @entity7 talks ' extremely important ' at first , the @entity13 talks were about @entity7 's proposal monday for @entity5 to give up control of its chemical weapons , which the @entity6 had demanded in order for @entity26 to drop plans to launch military strikes . @entity5 crisis : keeping up with key developments now the stakes have gotten higher , with @entity30 telling reporters that progress in the broader peace process will largely depend on whether the current @entity13 negotiations on @entity5 's chemical weapons succeed . a communique from last year 's @entity5 peace talks attended by all parties called for a ceasefire and establishing a fully inclusive transitional government to write a new constitution . that went nowhere , however . in fact , the @entity37 estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 2011 , in addition to more than 2 million becoming refugees and over 4 million being displaced within @entity5 . @entity170 , the joint @entity37 - @entity171 envoy on @entity5 , expressed fresh hopes friday that a peaceful , political solution to end the war could be reached . @entity30 and @entity31 's talks were a big reason for his optimism , with @entity170 calling them " extremely important " -- not regarding chemical weapons , but for the peace process generally . ' a criminal act ' to keep up pressure on @entity17 , @entity26 on friday described last month 's chemical weapons attack a " criminal " act . @entity107 weighed in as well , saying the @entity5 leader " has committed many crimes against humanity , and therefore i am sure there will be surely a process of accountability when everything is over . " @entity6 officials say the mere existence of talks with @entity7 on the matter is progress , noting that such a prospect would not have been considered just a week ago due to @entity15 's repeated efforts to block @entity37 action against @entity5 . @entity5 civil war : 5 things to pay attention to today speaking to reporters friday after he and @entity31 met with @entity170 , @entity30 called the talks about @entity5 's chemical weapons " constructive . " " we are working hard to find common ground to be able to make that happen . and we discussed some of the homework that we both need to do , " @entity30 said . @entity31 said @entity7 had promoted a peaceful solution to @entity5 's civil war , adding that the communique agreed to in last year 's first round of peace talks involving all the parties had been " basically abandoned . " on chemical weapons , @entity31 said international officials had to work together " to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly , professionally , as soon as practical . " opinion : is diplomacy the harder solution in @entity5 ? getting chemical weapons fraught with challenges even if all parties agree , weapons experts say the already major challenge of putting @entity5 's chemical stockpile under international control would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , amid an active civil war . @entity5 this week acknowledged that it possesses chemical weapons and wants to join the global convention that bans them . @entity0 's @entity235 reports that the convention would become legally binding on @entity5 30 days after it formally joins , meaning @entity17 's government would have to permit inspections at that time . after another 30 days -- which would be 60 days from when it formally joined the convention -- @entity5 would have to declare its chemical weapons stockpiles . on thursday , @entity17 noted that joining the convention would give @entity5 the standard 30 days from compliance to declare its stockpiles , but @entity30 responded by expressing concern about that long a time period , saying " we believe there is nothing standard about this process . " at the @entity22 on friday , spokeswoman @entity248 said that " verifying , accounting for securing and destroying a large stockpile of chemical weapons takes time , " adding that " it 's very difficult to do , particularly in an active war zone . " " if we keep forward momentum , if we believe there 's a credible and verifiable plan on the table to do just that , we 'll keep moving forward with that process , because resolving this issue diplomatically is certainly preferable to resolving it or to dealing with it with military action , " @entity248 said . in @entity263 , @entity6 soldiers guard against @entity5 missile threat political hurdles @entity26 had tried to put together a @entity267 coalition to attack @entity5 , but the @entity95 @entity268 voted against taking part , denying him a normally reliable ally . other allies said they wanted @entity37 authorization in the form of a @entity91 resolution before they would join a coalition . the president then asked @entity277 to authorize a military response in @entity5 but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the @entity7 proposal monday provided a diplomatic opening . in a speech to the nation tuesday night , @entity26 made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on @entity5 , challenging @entity277 and the @entity6 public to look at video footage of victims of the chemical attack . @entity7 president @entity291 responded with an op - ed posted wednesday night on the @entity294 ' website , saying " there is every reason to believe " @entity5 troops were n't responsible , while challenging @entity295 and the idea of " @entity6 exceptionalism . " his remarks provoked a strong reaction in the @entity6 , with some @entity6 politicians deeming them insulting and sickening . but rather than step back , @entity291 spokesman @entity304 fired back by claiming @entity295 was " unaccustomed ( to ) competition " in global matters and has " grown too used to patting everyone on the back patronizingly . " other questions loom in @entity295 . one has to do with the @entity5 opposition , some of whom are already receiving @entity6 - funded weapons and ammunition , according to a @entity6 official . yet there 's some questions about the mix of moderates and @entity321 extremists among the rebels , including some who are affiliated with @entity324 . then there 's the issue of @entity5 's chemical weapons themselves , and whether it 's possible to track all of them down . some @entity6 intelligence analysts believe it 's known where most of @entity5 's stockpile is stored , according to two @entity6 officials familiar with internal discussions . but others say the @entity6 might not be able to verify the location of up to 50 % of them . 7 - year - old 's story shows pain , worry of @entity5 refugees @entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 and @entity355 contributed to this report .	@entity22:State Department	@entity17:al-Assad	@entity26:Obama	@entity107:Ban	@entity355:Jim Acosta	@entity354:Ben Brumfield	@entity135:Chemical Weapons Convention	@entity277:Congress	@entity351:Elise Labott	@entity350:Jethro Mullen	@entity353:Jamie Crawford	@entity118:Al-Assad	@entity171:Arab League	@entity170:Brahimi	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Russian	@entity6:U.S.	@entity5:Syria	@entity235:Nick Paton Walsh	@entity93:China	@entity91:Security Council	@entity78:United Nations	@entity294:New York Times	@entity295:Washington	@entity352:Chris Lawrence	@entity291:Putin	@entity31:Lavrov	@entity30:Kerry	@entity15:Moscow	@entity35:New York	@entity37:U.N.	@entity346:Greg Botelho	@entity102:Damascus	@entity267:NATO	@entity268:Parliament	@entity348:Hamdi Alkhshali	@entity349:Samira Said	@entity13:Geneva	@entity347:Saad Abedine	@entity344:Jim Sciutto	@entity345:Athena Jones	@entity95:British	@entity263:Turkey	@entity248:Harf	@entity324:al Qaeda	@entity321:Islamist	@entity304:Dmitry Peskov	@entity45:Swiss	@entity94:France
@entity2 : @entity27 and @placeholder shootings raise questions about motive	@entity189	editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity3 and professor of law , policy and society at @entity7 in @entity8 . @entity9 has written 16 books , including " @entity11 : understanding @entity12 and @entity13 " and is writing a book on school violence and security . @entity2 says perpetrators of mass shootings usually do not suddenly go berserk . ( @entity19 ) -- massacre / suicide has become an all too familiar sight on the electronic pages of this and other news sites . but tuesday 's rampage in @entity26 , @entity27 -- with a body count reaching to the double digits -- forces us to struggle mightily in search of plausible explanations and effective solutions . what could have prompted 28 - year - old @entity35 to shoot to death his mother , grandmother , uncle , cousin and six others -- some of whom appear just to have been in the worst place at the worst time -- before turning the gun on himself ? mayor @entity47 summarized the collective bewilderment in @entity26 in the immediate aftermath of the bloodshed . " i do n't think anybody has any idea of what the motive is , " he said . in just over a few moments of horror , this rural community of a couple thousand residents that had n't had a single homicide in well over a decade , based on @entity59 crime reports , now had a multitude of questions about the will to kill . " apparently something just snapped , " speculated @entity65 , mayor of @entity66 , @entity27 , the community just outside @entity26 where @entity68 ended his own life after a police chase . because @entity68 chose suicide , the complete truth to his motivation may never be known . but from what can be learned from countless similar episodes in @entity78 and abroad , the crime may not be so unfathomable after all contrary to the widely held belief of " snap judgment , " perpetrators of mass murder -- and family annihilation in particular -- generally do not suddenly go berserk . if he was like most others who have walked in his shoes , @entity68 would have contemplated his actions for some period of time , surely more than the few moments it took to load his assault rifle . with a list of enemies and a large arsenal , his planning would probably have reflected calm deliberation and cool determination . in decades of research in collaboration with my @entity7 colleague @entity101 , certain common characteristics of mass killers emerge time and time again . first , the perpetrators tend to have experienced a long history of frustration and failure , resulting in a diminished ability to cope with life 's disappointments . second , they typically externalize blame , frequently complaining that others did n't give them a decent chance . without this , their destructiveness would instead be directed inward . in addition , these killers generally lack emotional support from friends or family . they are loners as well as losers . lacking this support system and reality check , they come to perceive some precipitating event as being absolutely catastrophic . this most often involves some kind of major disappointment : the loss of a job , the breakup of a relationship or financial ruin , surely a major issue in today 's economy . finally , they need access to a weapon powerful and rapid enough to satisfy their intense need for revenge . without much hope for a brighter tomorrow , these assailants often decide that life is not worth living ; rather than just taking their own life in quiet solitude , they are eager for payback . it becomes their all - consuming mission to avenge , with a death penalty , against those who caused them to suffer -- in reality or perhaps only in their paranoid interpretation of events . experiencing disappointment and failure so profound as to extinguish their desire to survive , most mass killers deliberately and methodically execute those closest to them , those they hold responsible for their troubles . there is little surprise , therefore , that mass murder overwhelmingly involves family members or co-workers , not total strangers . although there certainly are many well - known episodes of random slaughter of complete strangers , these are more the exception than the rule . in the wake of extraordinary shooting sprees like the @entity27 tragedy , calls for tighter gun control typically surface as a possible policy response for prevention . yet the mass shooting just hours later and thousands of miles away in rural @entity189 , where gun limits are stricter than in the @entity78 , reminds us that any debate must confront questions broader than just guns , even if the use of a high - powered firearm tends to increase the victim toll . regrettably , there are no simple fixes nor any means for reliably identifying mass killers before they act , despite the consistent profile . there are tens of thousands of @entity78 who would fit the mold , yet , fortunately , very few of them decide literally to take matters and guns into their own hands the best we can do , in terms of public policy and hometown approach , is to reach out to those around us who appear to be struggling emotionally or financially and offer friendship , compassion and understanding . at the end of the day , our efforts may not eliminate the risk of mass murder or necessarily deter the next @entity35 from turning his community into a personal battle zone , but at least we can enhance the well - being of countless citizens in the process of trying . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .	@entity3:Lipman Family Professor of Criminal Justice	@entity2:Fox	@entity13:Mass Murder	@entity7:Northeastern University	@entity12:Serial	@entity11:Extreme Killing	@entity189:Germany	@entity9:Fox	@entity8:Boston	@entity19:CNN	@entity101:Jack Levin	@entity47:Clay King	@entity35:Michael McLendon	@entity78:Americans	@entity68:McLendon	@entity66:Geneva	@entity26:Samson	@entity59:FBI	@entity65:Wynnton Melton	@entity27:Alabama
@entity18 projects @entity97 has won the @placeholder primary in @entity98 's 2nd @entity100	@entity7	it was billed as the day 's marquee primary battle , but in the end it was an easy night for @entity4 . the five - term senator from @entity6 -- who 's the top @entity7 in the chamber -- defeated tea party - backed challenger @entity9 in tuesday 's primary . in tuesday 's other high - profile race , two @entity7 candidates in @entity13 will face a july runoff for the @entity16 , @entity18 projects . according to numbers compiled by @entity21 , @entity19 led @entity9 60 % -36 % with 97 % of precincts reporting . @entity9 conceded , telling supporters that he had spoken with @entity19 . that conversation was confirmed by aides to the incumbent . in his concession speech , @entity9 did n't back @entity19 , but he said he has no intention " of supporting the @entity31 platform over the @entity7 platform . " but @entity9 appeared critical of @entity19 and the groups that supported him , saying " the attacks that we have been on the receiving end of have made our opposition smaller people . it has cheapened their accomplishments and it has weakened the foundation of their platform . " @entity19 praised @entity9 and made a pitch for reconciliation . " @entity9 brought a lot of passion and tenacity to this race and he made me a stronger candidate . a tough race is behind , it 's time to unite . to my opponent 's supporters , i hope you 'll join me in the months ahead and know that your fight is my fight , " @entity19 said . how @entity19 crushed the tea party @entity6 was one of six states holding primaries on tuesday and again , anti-establishment candidates faced long odds in high - profile @entity7 showdowns . in @entity13 , @entity18 projects @entity66 will win the @entity31 @entity16 primary , taking another step toward following in the footsteps of her father , @entity70 . on the @entity7 side , businessman @entity72 led the pack with 30 % of the vote -- well below the 50 % a candidate must get in order to avoid a runoff , according to numbers complied by @entity21 . @entity72 will face off against rep. @entity80 , who came in second with just under 27 % of the vote . the winner of the july runoff will go on to face @entity70 in november to fill the seat of retiring @entity7 sen. @entity86 . in @entity89 , @entity18 projects sen. @entity88 has won the @entity31 primary , and pediatric neurosurgeon @entity91 is the projected winner of the @entity7 @entity16 primary . the two will face off in the general election in november . and in @entity98 , @entity18 projects rep. @entity97 has won the @entity7 primary in the state 's 2nd @entity100 , turning back a challenge from tea party candidate @entity103 . 5 key primaries to watch tuesday while his primary battle ended up easier than originally expected , @entity19 now faces a much tougher test against @entity6 secretary of state @entity108 . @entity18 projected that @entity108 would win her primary . a rising @entity31 star , she faced no real opposition in her primary and already has had big names -- such as former president @entity113 -- team up with her on the campaign trail . speaking to supporters who held up signs that read " @entity119 needs @entity108 " and " @entity6 needs @entity4 , " the @entity16 majority leader tied his @entity31 challenger to president @entity119 and to senate majority leader @entity121 . " my opponent is in this race because @entity119 and @entity121 want her to be in this race , " said @entity19 , adding that " a vote for my opponent is a vote for @entity127 and the president who sold it to us on a mountain of lies . " @entity108 , who spoke at her victory celebration just minutes after @entity19 's speech ended , quickly fired back . " i 'm here to tell you tonight , my fellow @entity136 , i am not an empty dress , i am not a rubber stamp and i am not a cheerleader . i am a strong , @entity6 woman who is an independent thinker who , when i 'm @entity6 's next senator , the decisions i make will be what 's best for the people of the @entity6 , not partisan interests , " @entity108 declared . and she highlighted where she does n't see eye - to - eye with @entity119 . " i do n't agree with the president 's war on coal . i think it 's wrong for @entity6 , " @entity108 said . @entity108 connected to big donors , big hitters @entity9 , a businessman from @entity154 , announced his primary challenge last summer , and quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential @entity159 - based anti-establishment groups . the race between the two men quickly turned ugly , and expensive , as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks . anti-establishment @entity7 felt that @entity19 represented everything wrong in @entity159 and thought he could be knocked off . the @entity168 fund dished out $ 1 million in support of @entity9 and against @entity19 . but the group recently became very quiet , with @entity19 's formidable lead in the public opinion polls . large campaign war chest but @entity19 had a large campaign war chest , as well as the backing from two @entity6 - based super pacs , and such powerful national groups as the @entity179 @entity178 and the @entity180 . and @entity19 ended his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from @entity6 's other @entity7 senator , @entity184 , the one - time upstart who beat @entity19 's pick in the 2010 @entity7 @entity16 primary in @entity6 . but the two quickly mended fences , and @entity184 , who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians , backed @entity19 last year before @entity9 got into the race . @entity184 congratulated @entity19 in a tweet . the narrator in one of @entity19 's two closing statewide tv commercials says , " on tuesday , join with @entity184 and vote for @entity4 . " and the spot includes a clip of @entity184 saying last year that @entity6 " ought to be proud of having senator @entity19 . " earlier this year @entity19 predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right , saying , " i think we are going to crush them everywhere . " @entity19 told the @entity203 that when it came to tea party challenges , " i do n't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country . " his prediction might come true , as @entity19 's defeat of @entity9 was the latest in a string of victories for incumbent and more moderate @entity7 over candidates backed by tea party activists and other grassroots and anti-establishment groups . soon after the race in @entity6 was called for @entity19 , two of the groups backing @entity9 closed ranks behind the @entity16 minority leader . " now it 's time for @entity7 to unite for victory in november , " said a statement from the @entity223 . and the @entity226 released a statement saying , " we congratulate @entity19 on winning the primary . we ask all republicans to come together to defeat extremist @entity230 liberal @entity108 this fall . " now it 's on to november 's midterm elections , where @entity31 -- who hold a 55 - 45 majority in the chamber ( including two independents who caucus with the party -- are defending 21 of the 36 seats in play , with half of those @entity31 - held seats in red or purple states . key races to watch the only states where the @entity31 currently hope to play offense are @entity6 and @entity13 . if the @entity7 flips six @entity31 held seats , they 'll will win control of the chamber , and @entity19 will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader . @entity19 made a pitch for that promotion in his victory speech , saying " we can take the reins of power away from @entity121 and make this president accountable . make me the majority leader and @entity6 will lead @entity179 . " a big question right now is whether @entity9 and his supporters will rally around @entity19 , or if they sit it out come november . in 2010 , after @entity184 topped @entity19 - backed candidate @entity266 , the minority leader was quick to bring all sides together at a unity rally . the battle ahead the faceoff in @entity6 should continue to be heated , and expensive . when all 's said and done , the race could become the most expensive @entity16 campaign in history , breaking the $ 82 million record set in the 2012 @entity16 battle in @entity277 . @entity108 , 35 , is using classic campaign strategy against the 72 - year - old longtime incumbent : it 's time for change . " we 've had 30 years of failed leadership under @entity4 ; we can not afford six more , " @entity108 declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in @entity154 on monday . to counter that , @entity19 is using a standard strategy for a longtime incumbent . he is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn @entity136 about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in @entity159 representing them instead of a potential @entity16 majority leader . " my opponent , i certainly agree , is a new face , but a new face for what ? new face for the status quo . same majority leader , same agenda , no change at all . a new face for no change at all , " @entity19 argues on the stump . but @entity108 ' full - throated assault on @entity19 goes beyond a call for change . she is using @entity19 's @entity7 leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in @entity159 . like republicans all over the country , @entity19 is trying hard to make this election a referendum on president @entity119 , who lost @entity6 big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now . " do we want to go in a different direction , or do we want @entity121 to continue to be the majority leader ? do we want a vote for @entity119 in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries ? that 's what 's really at stake in the fall election , " @entity19 told @entity18 monday . and the @entity334 outside group @entity333 said they would spend nearly $ 600,000 starting wednesday to run a television commercial that ties @entity108 to the president . the problem for @entity19 is that he too has a high unfavorable ratings back home , and @entity31 here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall . the most recent polling indicates the two candidates are all tied up in the november showdown .	@entity21:The Associated Press	@entity80:Jack Kingston	@entity333:Kentuckians for Strong Leadership	@entity159:Washington	@entity113:Bill Clinton	@entity86:Saxby Chambliss	@entity277:Massachusetts	@entity88:Merkley	@entity89:Oregon	@entity136:Kentuckians	@entity353:Kingston	@entity334:pro-McConnell	@entity97:Mike Simpson	@entity230:Hollywood	@entity7:GOP	@entity6:Kentucky	@entity4:Mitch McConnell	@entity179:America	@entity178:Chamber of Commerce	@entity9:Bevin	@entity119:Barack Obama	@entity154:Louisville	@entity70:Nunn	@entity72:Perdue	@entity31:Democrats	@entity16:Senate	@entity13:Georgia	@entity19:McConnell	@entity18:CNN	@entity100:Congressional District	@entity103:Bryan Smith	@entity98:Idaho	@entity108:Grimes	@entity127:Obamacare	@entity266:Trey Grayson	@entity91:Wehby	@entity121:Harry Reid	@entity223:Senate Conservatives Fund	@entity226:Madison Project	@entity180:National Rifle Association	@entity168:Senate Conservatives	@entity184:Paul	@entity203:New York Times	@entity66:Michelle Nunn

" @entity89 's employee @entity88 said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister tore through the building . " the three of us were kind of trapped in there , holding the door shut , praying to @entity102 that we do n't die and that everybody else was safe , " @entity88 told @entity0 affiliate @entity94 , adding , " it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch . " @entity104 and his partner rode the twister out in their truck in the parking lot . " it started hailing and then it quit hailing and then all of a sudden the wind hit and it just went dark and here went everything , " @entity104 told @entity94 . " trucks went to rocking ... and next thing we know the whole roof and everything was gone .

" @entity55 " and a bendable @placeholder also made the top 10	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- mutant horrors , singers and kissing strangers had a big year on @entity4 . all of the above joined soccer stars , a bending @entity6 , a beer commercial and a dose of street activism on the video site 's list of the most popular posts of 2014 . @entity13 , a @entity14 actor , director and web prankster , scored the top spot with " @entity17 , " which had scared up more than 113 million views since he posted it in september . in it , @entity20 films people in everyday situations into which he unleashes his otherwise cute dog , @entity26 , wearing a costume that gives the pooch eight giant , creepy spider legs . . it was n't without a dose of controversy .

" they shed all these layers in front of our eyes and in front of the cameras and that sweetness and kindness resonated with people .

@entity2 websites hacked after @placeholder 's shutdown are mostly ok friday , source says	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 authorities overreacted in shutting down the online file - sharing site @entity6 and seeking criminal charges against its executives , the company 's @entity2 lawyer said friday . " we believe that the allegations are without merit and @entity6 is going to vigorously defend against the case , " attorney @entity10 said . federal authorities shut the site down thursday , the same day they announced indictments against seven people connected to the site , accusing them of operating an " international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works . " four of those charged were arrested friday in @entity24 at the request of @entity2 authorities . the site , which traffic - tracking service @entity26 ranked as the world 's 72nd most visited website before it was taken down , allowed users to share and download files , many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission , according to authorities . @entity10 said the case demonstrates a " copyright extremist mentality " on the part of @entity2 authorities and raises significant due process and consumer protection issues . he said it was inappropriate for @entity2 authorities to seize the company 's servers and domain names , not to mention $ 50 million in assets , without a court hearing . he also said the seizure means consumers who had stored legitimately acquired materials on sites owned by @entity6 can no longer access them . the seizure " has essentially created a chilling effect on consumers using @entity56 cloud storage going forward , " @entity10 said . federal prosecutors allege @entity6 's founders " conducted their illegal operation using a business model expressly designed to promote uploading of the most popular copyrighted works . " the site 's popular @entity6 subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its copious selection of pirated content , including recent movies and episodes of hit tv shows . " the conspirators allegedly paid users whom they specifically knew uploaded infringing content and publicized their links to users throughout the world , " prosecutors said in a statement . they also took steps to mask the presence of illegal content on the site , prosecutors said . the company also discouraged users from using the site for legitimate personal storage by automatically deleting files that were n't regularly downloaded , prosecutors said . authorities said the operation had generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships . those indicted are citizens of @entity24 , @entity98 , @entity99 and the @entity100 . no @entity2 citizens were named . however , @entity6 has servers in @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105 , which prompted the @entity104 - based investigation . the investigation involved 20 search warrants in eight countries , authorities said . officials seized 18 domain names from the company and its servers based in the @entity2 , the @entity100 and @entity114 . @entity6 's sudden shutdown thursday got the attention of hackers , who quickly assembled a widespread operation to take down the @entity120 and @entity122 websites , as well as those for the @entity124 , the @entity125 and several other sites . the internet activism and hacking collective @entity129 took credit for the denial - of - service attacks , which do n't damage computer systems but keep sites from operating properly by overloading them with spurious requests . that can slow a site down or keep its servers from responding to legitimate requests . " it 's a violation of freedom of speech , " one @entity129 member told @entity0 of the @entity6 shutdown . " it 's part of a bigger picture that 's taking place ... which is a very big slide toward internet censorship on a gigantic scale . " most of the sites were back up by friday morning , but the website for @entity24 police , which @entity129 also targeted , appeared to be down early saturday . the @entity120 and @entity122 sites targeted thursday were operating normally on friday , a law enforcement official told @entity0 . investigators are " looking at forensics to see where ( the attack ) came from , " the official said . no data breaches occurred on @entity2 government sites , the law enforcement official told @entity0 . the four @entity6 officials arrested in @entity24 -- @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 -- appeared friday at an initial court hearing . @entity162 , the @entity6 founder and owner , spoke briefly , interrupting an attorney who sought to stop reporters from photographing the men , according to the @entity172 newspaper . " we do n't mind ... if people want to take photographs of us or cover this event because we 've got nothing to hide , " the newspaper quoted him as saying . it was unclear when extradition proceedings would begin . the four were arrested after a complicated raid that involved 76 police officers who arrived at a @entity24 mansion by helicopter and had to repeatedly defeat electronic locks in pursuing @entity162 , @entity24 's @entity186 reported , citing detective inspector @entity187 . officers had to cut their way into a safe room , where they found @entity162 near a sawed - off shotgun , the broadcaster reported . " it was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door , " @entity186 quoted @entity187 as saying . the raid , seizure and shutdown comes in the same week as a widespread @entity56 protest over controversial anti-piracy bills in the @entity199 and @entity200 that would make it easier for @entity2 authorities to target foreign piracy sites , of which prosecutors allege @entity6 was one . the bills are known as the @entity206 , or @entity206 , and the @entity207 , or @entity207 . the bills are aimed at cracking down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content . but the legislation has created a divide between tech giants , who say the language is too broad , and large media companies , who say they are losing millions each year to rampant online piracy . @entity223 , the parent company of @entity0 , is among the industry supporters of the legislation . on friday , after numerous legislators pulled their support for the legislation in the wake of the protests , @entity227 and @entity200 leaders announced they would delay action on the legislation to address concerns raised by activists . @entity10 said the shutdown calls into question whether legislation like @entity206 or @entity207 is truly needed . " this demonstrates the government is certainly able to act without any additional legislation , " he said . @entity0 's @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report	@entity163:Finn Batato	@entity26:Alexa	@entity24:New Zealand	@entity129:Anonymous	@entity114:Canada	@entity125:Recording Industry Association of America	@entity2:U.S.	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Megaupload	@entity199:U.S. House	@entity122:FBI	@entity56:Internet	@entity10:Ira Rothken	@entity100:Netherlands	@entity172:New Zealand Herald	@entity245:Amber Lyon	@entity103:Ashburn	@entity104:Virginia	@entity105:Washington	@entity99:Slovakia	@entity98:Germany	@entity124:Motion Picture Association of America	@entity200:Senate	@entity207:PIPA	@entity206:SOPA	@entity263:Hacking	@entity248:David Goldman	@entity162:Dotcom	@entity247:Carol Cratty	@entity223:Time Warner	@entity164:Mathias Ortmann	@entity227:House	@entity165:Bram van der Kolk	@entity246:Steve Turnham	@entity186:TV One	@entity187:Wormald	@entity120:Justice Department	@entity244:Terry Frieden	@entity243:Laurie Segall
when @placeholder is completed , it 's expected to be world 's third - tallest building	@entity5	@entity0 has needled out @entity1 for the title of @entity4 's tallest building . @entity5 in @entity0 will be the @entity4 ' tallest building when completed , beating out @entity1 's @entity6 , according to an announcement tuesday by the @entity8 . the main issue was whether a 408 - foot needle atop the @entity5 would be counted in the total height of the tower . the council 's height committee met on november 8 in @entity1 to rule on the height of the new skyscraper . on tuesday , the council announced that the needle , which was completed in may , was in fact a " spire " -- a " vertical element that completes the architectural expression of the building and is intended as permanent . " @entity5 's height to its architectural top is 1,776 feet ( 541.3 meters ) , according to the ruling . the @entity6 's architectural height is 1,451 feet ( 442.1 meters ) . confused ? it 's a bit technical . 25 great skyscrapers : icons of construction the council , an independent organization that certifies the official height of skyscrapers and acknowledges record - setting buildings , counts spires and structural elements in its height calculations . but it does n't count antennas , signage or flagpoles , which are considered " functional - technical equipment subject to change . " " it 's about the authorship of the architect in some ways , and the permanence of the piece to reinforce the role of design , " said council spokesman @entity46 . as the building was originally designed , the needle atop the tower was to be enclosed in a radome , an architectural structure made of fiberglass and steel . but the proposed radome -- short for radar dome -- would not be able to be serviced or maintained , so the cladding plan was nixed . coming soon : @entity67 's first ' invisible ' tower project chief architect @entity68 and the rest of the @entity5 team convinced the council 's height committee that the spire was , itself , architectural . the designers noted that the top of the new building 's steel parapet is located at 1,368 feet , the height of the original @entity79 1 . the spire reaches from that parapet to the new building 's height of 1,776 feet . " i feel completely satisfied that this building achieved what it set out to do , " @entity68 said . " we used the council 's rules and designed around them . it 's an important statement for all of us to make . " " with respect to the events of 9/11 and what this building commemorates with 1776 and democracy and freedom ... we were very happy to find that the building fit our criteria to be 1,776 feet tall , " said @entity89 , the council 's chairman . because @entity5 is n't yet finished and has n't received its certificate of occupancy , it can not be ranked as a " completed building , " but " its height is no longer in dispute , " the council said in a tuesday press release . upon completion , which is expected in early 2014 , the @entity0 skyscraper is expected to rank as the world 's third - tallest building , after the @entity109 in @entity110 and the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 .	@entity67:World	@entity1:Chicago	@entity0:New York	@entity6:Willis Tower	@entity5:1WTC	@entity4:United States	@entity8:Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat	@entity117:Tall Buildings	@entity46:Daniel Safarik	@entity79:World Trade Center Tower	@entity112:Mecca	@entity68:Childs	@entity110:Dubai	@entity89:Timothy Johnson	@entity113:Saudi Arabia	@entity111:Makkah Royal Clock Tower	@entity109:Burj Khalifa
the @placeholder made his return in a doubles victory on tuesday	@entity31	( @entity0 ) -- former world no. 1 @entity1 was back in singles action for the first time in seven months wednesday , making a winning return on the clay courts he has dominated so emphatically in recent years . having not played a singles match since his shock defeat to @entity9 in the second round of @entity11 last year due to a left knee injury , a little rustiness was perhaps to be expected . but , after losing the first two games of his match with @entity17 @entity16 , the 11 - time grand slam champion recovered to record a morale - boosting 6 - 3 6 - 2 victory in the second round of the @entity22 in @entity23 " i 'm happy to play a singles match after so long , " the 26 - year - old told the @entity26 @entity26 's website . " i need days and time to get my game back , but so far the feeling on court is great . " the @entity31 , who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings during his long absence , made his much - anticipated return in a doubles match tuesday . @entity1 partnered up with @entity17 's @entity36 to beat the @entity38 pairing of @entity39 and @entity40 . " for now the most important thing is to spend as much time as possible on court , " added @entity1 . " this victory allows me to play at least two more matches , singles and doubles . " to practice is one thing but to play is totally different . in a real match you ca n't control your body as you do in practice . " @entity1 's focus will be firmly on the @entity55 , the year 's second grand slam which begins in may in @entity57 . the @entity59 native has ruled the @entity55 event in recent years , winning seven of the last eight events . his hopes of marking his comeback by claiming the title in @entity66 were boosted by the defeat of @entity68 . the defending champion and second seed was shocked 7 - 6 6 - 4 by the 93rd ranked @entity72 of @entity73 , who recorded just his second career win over a top 20 player .	@entity17:Argentine	@entity16:Federico Delbonis	@entity1:Rafael Nadal	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:World Tour	@entity55:Roland Garros	@entity11:Wimbledon	@entity23:Vina del Mar.	@entity39:Frantisek Cermak	@entity38:Czech	@entity9:Lukas Rosol	@entity36:Juan Monaco	@entity22:Chile Open	@entity40:Lukas Dlouhy	@entity68:World No.15 Monaco	@entity66:Chile	@entity57:Paris	@entity59:Mallorca	@entity31:Spaniard	@entity73:France	@entity72:Guillaume Rufin
equestrian among sports facing fight to preserve @placeholder status	@entity9	@entity2 , @entity3 ( @entity4 ) -- " see what i 'll miss ? " princess @entity5 has been ambushed . the 40 - year - old leader of one of the @entity9 ' biggest sports finds herself fending off @entity11 paradressage rider @entity10 . @entity10 wears around his neck the three gold medals he has won at the @entity14 in @entity2 , @entity15 . as he leans in , medals dangling above the seated @entity5 's left shoulder , he announces : " now ma'am , i know you were quite good at showjumping and you might not have enough golds , so i thought i 'd let you have a feel of my gongs . " this is what the princess will miss when , in december , she reaches the end of her two terms leading the @entity28 , which governs world horse sport . one of very few women to occupy such a prominent position within the @entity9 movement , @entity5 is the subject of a warm , impromptu tribute from @entity10 . " she 's brought inclusion from many countries that thought equestrianism was kind of elitist , " says the 10 - time @entity36 champion . " she 's kept us in the @entity9 by making sure @entity41 was such a success , and she 's modernized it . we 're not riders , we 're athletes . " her royal highness princess @entity5 carried her country 's flag at the @entity48 , where she competed as a showjumper at the age of 26 . four years later she married sheik @entity51 , an equestrian endurance racing enthusiast . by 2006 , he had become the prime minister of the @entity54 and she had been elected to lead the @entity28 . since then , much of her role has been to ensure equestrian keeps its place at sport 's top table . like wrestling , equestrianism claims roots extending back to the original @entity9 contested by the ancient @entity63 . hence , when wrestling had a scare last year -- being temporarily voted off the program for @entity67 2020 , before reinstatement at a later @entity69 ( @entity69 ) meeting -- there may have been grounds for concern at the @entity28 . " i believe there were very specific issues around the decision for wrestling , " says @entity5 . " but i believe no international federation can consider that their place goes without saying . " very much the reason i came to the @entity28 , to try to modernize , was not the fact that my sport had got worse or gone backwards -- but other international federations had moved a lot faster than us . " that spirit of competition , that commercially cluttered landscape really does exist . the international federations compete for their place at the @entity14 just as much as the athletes do , and you have to guarantee that you really do have top sport . " @entity5 points to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) as evidence that the @entity28 is doing its job . the latest edition of the quadrennial event boasted more than a thousand horses and riders , from 74 countries . the @entity28 claims more than half a billion people saw at least some action from the eight competing disciplines . " we 've never had a larger event than this , " she says . " the growth that 's happened over the past four years has made a marked difference . " there is a larger percentage of non-purist spectators in the stands and we are able to export our sport to a new public . our digital numbers have rocketed . our athletes are not just performing for the family any more , they are performing for the world . " all of that will be taken to the table by @entity5 's successor -- six candidates have come forward -- the next time the @entity69 calls on its constituent sports to fight for their future . @entity5 believes the @entity69 is most likely to look at removing one discipline from a large sport in order to accommodate a new , smaller sport in @entity67 and beyond . she thinks the @entity28 's battle lies in protecting its three @entity9 disciplines of dressage , showjumping and eventing . not that the @entity9 disciplines have always dominated @entity5 's eight years at the @entity28 's helm . endurance racing , a lower - profile form of equestrian sport immensely popular in the @entity138 , has provided the biggest threat to her presidency . the sport , in which horses can race a hundred miles in a day , has been troubled by a succession of doping scandals and concerns over animal welfare given the immense distance involved . @entity5 's position was called into question when her husband -- an endurance racing champion , an influential horse breeder and also the ruler of @entity154 -- received a six - month doping ban in 2009 . she has since been accused of failing to vigorously pursue perceived shortcomings in the discipline 's approach to the wellbeing of horses . @entity5 , who handed oversight of endurance sport to colleagues over the conflict of interest involving her husband , says the issues are now being " managed very well " by the @entity28 . " the sport has mainly come under criticism -- or the @entity28 has -- because it has n't moved fast enough , " she admits . " but on the other side of that , there are processes and procedures put in place for a good reason . " you ca n't have a knee - jerk reaction . you have to go through a period of dialogue and examine the situation from every side . they have been strong enough to do that and i think they 've done everything they can to protect the horses , and the integrity of the sport . " for her part , @entity5 says she wishes she had " had a lighter hand in some situations " in the earlier days of her time in charge . and as regards her unusual position as a leading woman in world sport , she believes examining gender equity only in the highest echelons of power means searching in the wrong place . " i think a lot is done to help women get to these positions but for me , what is missing is the avenue to come up through the grassroots , " she says . " for me it was easy . i had my career as an athlete , i rode in an @entity9 , then i had interaction with the national federations . i understood how it worked , and i went through a pathway . " what 's missing is that opportunity for women at grassroots level in other sports . while you had the opportunities at the top , there is still very much a vacuum in between . " i think in many ways it 's harmful that we have this permanent crusade , that we ' have to have women . ' it makes it sound like you got the job because you 're a woman , rather than being able to do the job properly . " there 's a big difference between a person who merits doing the job and happens to be a woman , and one who gets the job just because she is . " the @entity28 's vote to replace @entity5 in three months ' time will determine the sport 's course for at least the next four years . with organizations associated with the @entity138 accounting for a number of equestrianism 's major backers , brought in through @entity5 and her connections , there is uncertainty as to how the financial future will pan out if and when her influence wanes . she , however , has already promised herself more time for two other interests in her life . in a statement turning down the chance to stand for a third term , the mother - of - two listed first her family and then humanitarian work , in @entity261 , as her new priorities . " i felt the president should only have an eight - year term and i still feel that is important , " says @entity5 , who had at one time announced her intent to seek a third term -- a move some considered " undemocratic " despite a majority of national federations backing the necessary rule changes . " as president , you have to do a 12 - hour day , it 's a full - time job , and it 's only really possible to do that for eight years until you do run out of ideas , " she says . " the sport is bigger than any international federation ever will be . sometimes , you get the feeling the world revolves around you . i 've always known that if we stop , the sport never will . it 's worth knowing that .

@entity6 @placeholder discovered the fossil known as " the world 's oldest child "	@entity5	it was another december afternoon back in 2000 , spent like hundreds of others combing the rocky hills of the @entity4 region , when @entity6 scientist @entity5 heard one of his assistants nearby calling him . " he said ' oh , doctor i see something there , ' " recalls @entity5 , who 'd been excavating the hot and dry landscape for over a year , helped only by a small inexperienced crew of locals . " and i went there and i see the cheek bone part ... sticking out of the rock . i turned it upside down and my jaw literally dropped . " instantly , @entity5 realized this was an extraordinary discovery that could make scientific history . " right away i could tell this is a child of a human ancestor , " says the paleoanthropologist . " you have this child in a block of sandstone , with the baby teeth still visible , very vertical forehead , small canine , " he adds . " but it 's so rare and so unbelievable that i just could n't accept that was the case , that what i saw was the skeleton . " read this : civil war survivor creates bionic limbs yet @entity5 did not want to make news of his discovery public until he had a more complete picture of what he 'd unearthed . so he kept it quiet as he meticulously prepared and analyzed the fossil . " the skeleton was encaved in a block of sandstone matrix , which is very densely compact , very inured sand , so that i had to go remove the sand grain by grain , " says @entity5 . " so i took my time , and people advised me to employ technicians , and technicians can do that job , but i said ' no , it 's going to take as long as it takes but i 'm not going to delegate this work of the exploration of this unique child to anyone else but me . ' " @entity5 then spent years in the lab painstakingly picking away the sand grain by grain . by using a super microscope , he was able to see details in the teeth embedded in the skull that revealed to him the skeleton 's age and the sex . he now knew the fossil was that of a three - year - old girl who had died 3.3 million years ago . finally , after more than six long years , @entity5 was ready to present to the world " @entity77 , " the fossil known as " the world 's oldest child . " " when the time came to go to the press conference , " remembers @entity5 , " it was like a woman is pregnant and she is holding that baby for nine months and when the baby comes out , what happens is -- in spite of the pain , in spite of the long , tedious process of carrying the baby -- you see her smiling , you see her beautiful wonderful face trying to share the baby with her husband or the doctor . " so i shared my baby with the audience but the different thing is that i was sharing a child that belonged not only to me but to humanity , to seven billion individuals . " read this : @entity109 midwife , @entity110 ? that press conference in 2006 turned @entity5 , who was just 31 when he 'd discovered @entity77 , into a hero in the world of science . over the next few years , his work took him all over the world , winning him international admiration for his achievements . today @entity5 is the director of anthropology at the @entity120 , a multifaceted scientific institution and museum where he combines his scientific research with his passion for public education . " when i got involved in this type of research i decided to not only read what has already been discovered but also to make my own discoveries and i can proudly say that i have achieved that with the discovery of @entity77 and many other fossils , " he says . " those finds are finds that change textbooks , literally , so i am happy but i 'm not satisfied -- i will be satisfied only if i could instill the same type of psychology , the same type of excitement , the same type of passion to the next generations of @entity109 .

" the insurgency has been turned back in much " of @entity8 , @placeholder says	@entity31	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a @entity5 - based terrorist group that is actively attacking @entity3 troops across the border in @entity8 is an " arm " of the @entity5 intelligence agency , the top @entity3 military officer told @entity11 on thursday . the blunt accusation from the chairman of the @entity14 , adm. @entity13 , reflected the growing impatience of @entity3 officials with @entity5 's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that @entity5 is actively supporting the insurgents . but the recent high profile attacks by insurgents in @entity8 represent a shift in strategy by the @entity26 , who have ceded control of territory in much of the country , the @entity3 secretary of defense said thursday . " the insurgency has been turned back in much of the country , including its heartland in the south , and @entity38 are increasingly strong and capable , " secretary of defense @entity31 said in a @entity33 hearing . the attacks , including last week 's attempt to strike at the @entity42 headquarters and the @entity43 in @entity44 and this week 's assassination of former @entity8 president @entity46 , who was leading efforts for reconciliation talks , have raised questions about the ability of @entity8 security forces to maintain control . but @entity31 , testifying to the committee along with @entity13 , said the @entity26 strikes are a sign of weakness . " we judge this change in tactics to be a result of a shift in momentum in our favor and a sign of weakness in the insurgency , " @entity31 said . he said many challenges remain . " we must be more effective in stopping these attacks and limiting the ability of insurgents to create perceptions of decreasing security , " he told the committee in his opening statement . the chairman of the committee , sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , said the ability of the @entity80 , a @entity5 militant group accused of being responsible for last week 's @entity44 attack and numerous others in which @entity3 and @entity42 troops have died , to launch attacks over the border from @entity5 is unacceptable . @entity75 expressed frustration with the @entity5 government , which has yet to use its troops to crack down on the insurgents and has not publicly condemned the attacks in @entity8 , either . @entity13 , appearing for the last time in front of the committee before his retirement at the end of the month , spoke candidly about concerns about the threat posed by the @entity80 . @entity5 is " exporting " violence to @entity8 , he said . " the @entity80 , for one , acts as a veritable arm of @entity5 's intelligence , " @entity13 said . he said @entity5 's @entity101 supported the @entity80 insurgents who planned and executed the attack on the @entity43 and other strikes in @entity8 . in doing so , @entity13 said , the agency is jeopardizing @entity5 's relations with the @entity3 and @entity8 . but he added that the solution is not to give up on @entity5 and said a flawed relationship is better than no relationship . @entity13 has spent a significant amount of time during his chairmanship building relations with the @entity5 . " some say i have wasted my time , " @entity13 said , but he disagrees , saying the situation would be far worse if not for @entity3 - @entity5 relations . in recent meetings between @entity3 and @entity5 officials , including @entity13 with the top @entity5 military officer and cia director @entity121 with @entity5 's top intelligence officer , the @entity3 has pushed @entity5 to crack down on the @entity80 , @entity31 said . given the public nature of thursday 's hearing , @entity31 would not discuss what further steps the @entity3 is willing to take to stop the attacks , but a @entity3 official said this week that the @entity128 has increased drone strikes against the insurgent network within @entity5 . in @entity5 , a spokesman for the @entity132 denied that @entity101 supports the @entity80 insurgent group , brushing aside the @entity3 categorization of the connection as " perceptions . " in a press briefing held in @entity139 on thursday , spokesman @entity137 said @entity5 is not helping the @entity80 . replying to a question on whether @entity5 is involved in a proxy war in @entity8 , @entity137 said , " i would say a categoric no. " foreign minister @entity142 said friday that the accusations coming out of @entity0 are unacceptable to @entity5 . " you will lose an ally , " @entity142 said on @entity144 . " you can not afford to alienate @entity5 . you can not afford to alienate the @entity5 people . " members of @entity11 have raised the idea of cutting back on the billions of dollars in aid given to @entity5 . sen. @entity153 , @entity154 , said the @entity155 has placed conditions on counterterrorism aid , including that the secretary of state must certify that @entity5 is cooperating in @entity3 efforts against the @entity80 and other terrorist groups . @entity31 differs with the @entity161 on whether that is a fair condition , but said he does support the message it will send . " anything that makes clear to them that we can not tolerate their providing this kind of safe haven to the @entity80 , and that they have to take action , any signal we can send to them i think would be important to do , " he said . the top @entity178 on the committee , sen. @entity175 , @entity176 , called for slowing down the withdrawal of troops from @entity8 to maintain the advantage of the surge of troops added last year . @entity13 said there is " increased risk " in pushing ahead with the withdrawal of 10,000 troops by next summer , as announced by president @entity189 . " while the risk is up , i think it is manageable , " and military success can still be sustained , he said . @entity175 pressed @entity31 on whether the @entity46 assassination shows the @entity26 has no interest in reconciliation . " it does raise concerns . it raises suspicions . nevertheless , i think , obviously , we have to continue to try to pursue the opportunities that are out there . but we ought to do it with our eyes open , " @entity31 said . " the best signal we can send to the @entity26 is that we 're going to continue to fight them and that we 're going to continue to be there , and that we 're not going anywhere . and if we can send them that clear signal , i think that , more than anything , would influence their willingness to develop reconciliation . " the top commander in @entity8 , gen. @entity215 , believes @entity26 fighters in @entity8 are upset and frustrated , @entity13 said . with " their leadership parked in @entity5 , " @entity215 sees " the fighters on the field in @entity8 are more and more disgruntled . their morale is down , " @entity13 explained . regarding @entity222 , @entity31 said the @entity3 continues to negotiate over any presence of @entity3 troops in that country after 2011 . currently , all @entity3 troops will be withdrawing from the country , in accordance with the existing agreement with @entity222 . " no final decisions have been made , " @entity31 said . @entity222 has expressed a desire to maintain @entity3 trainers and other aid going forward , he noted , to help them deal with security threats . " i want to be clear that any future security relationship with @entity222 will be fundamentally different from the one that we have had since 2003 . the @entity3 wants a normal , productive relationship and close strategic partnership with a sovereign @entity222 government going forward , " @entity31 said . " this kind of security assistance would be a means of furthering our strategic partnership with @entity222 that looks to the kind of future role that can best address @entity222 security needs . " @entity175 urged that the @entity3 not abandon @entity222 and " not withdraw from @entity222 as irresponsibly " as the @entity189 administration accused the the @entity252 government of being when the war was started . @entity31 and @entity13 also warned about cutting too much from the defense budget . if @entity11 can not come to an agreement on further spending cuts , an additional $ 500 million in defense spending would be cut . @entity13 said too harsh a cut would have a " good chance of breaking " the military . " we are not going to solve the debt problem on the back of the @entity264 , " he warned . @entity31 was equally emphatic in arguing against further cuts beyond the $ 350 billion the @entity264 has already committed to over the next 10 years . " if we pulled that trigger would we be shooting ourselves in the foot , " asked sen. @entity266 , @entity268 - @entity267 . " we 'd be shooting ourselves in the head , " @entity31 said .	@entity26:Taliban	@entity80:Haqqani network	@entity252:Bush	@entity139:Islamabad	@entity153:Susan Collins	@entity137:Junjua	@entity155:Senate Appropriations Committee	@entity132:Foreign Ministry	@entity3:United States	@entity215:Allen	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity175:McCain	@entity5:Pakistan	@entity176:R-Arizona	@entity178:Republican	@entity8:Afghanistan	@entity75:Levin	@entity76:D-Michigan	@entity31:Panetta	@entity33:Senate Armed Service Committee	@entity14:Joint Chiefs of Staff	@entity13:Mullen	@entity11:Congress	@entity38:Afghan National Security Forces	@entity101:ISI	@entity161:State Department	@entity268:R	@entity128:CIA	@entity264:Pentagon	@entity267:South Carolina	@entity266:Lindsey Graham	@entity121:David Petraeus	@entity144:GEO TV	@entity189:Obama	@entity222:Iraq	@entity142:Khar	@entity44:Kabul	@entity46:Rabbani	@entity42:NATO	@entity43:U.S. Embassy	@entity154:R-Maine

though kicked out of @entity18 , @placeholder does a great deal of business in @entity9	@entity6	editor 's note : @entity3 executive producer @entity2 is the author of " @entity4 : @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 . " private contractor @entity6 flies military personnel in @entity9 and helps train @entity9 border police . the company formerly known as @entity6 , now called @entity6 much to its chagrin , has been at the center of the contractor debate for years . from the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in @entity17 , @entity18 , in 2004 , to a shooting involving a team of its men in a @entity23 neighborhood in which at least 14 @entity18 civilians were killed in 2007 , the company has drawn unwanted headlines . @entity6 owner @entity5 downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment . he changed the company 's name after the @entity18 government banned it from doing business there . but those who thought contractors were going away under president @entity35 's administration could n't be more wrong . according to the @entity37 , there are some 68,000 contractors in @entity9 today and more than 132,000 in @entity18 . but those numbers are n't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they do n't include those working for other government agencies such as the @entity45 . many of those tens of thousands are third - country nationals , meaning they were hired from a third country to go to @entity18 . many earn between $ 400 and $ 700 a month ; while @entity50 , particularly those performing dangerous security duties , can earn as much in a day . despite being kicked out of @entity18 , @entity6 still does a healthy business in @entity9 , flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train @entity9 border police charged with making the country 's massive , porous borders more secure . it 's one of the many jobs that the @entity50 military just is n't staffed to tackle on its own . in fact , the @entity50 military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors . there are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors . and that 's the problem . the @entity50 has come to rely on them so heavily , in such a short period of time , that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately . even among the eight - member team that makes up the @entity81 , a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in @entity18 and @entity9 , the question of whether the @entity50 needs the contractors is n't even an issue . the issue , rather , is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in @entity18 . in its interim report released this month , the @entity81 found that " neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years ' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts . " the report also said , " the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions . the decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed - security and life - support tasks for military units . " one of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern - day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur . that has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the @entity121 , as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas . @entity128 , head of the @entity129 , an industry - friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies , spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards . " we have the power to kick people out of the association , " @entity128 said , but that 's about where it ends . they ca n't prosecute anyone . but to say that there has been no progress on the legal front would n't be fair . legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the @entity150 , but with everything in this business , there was a hang - up with that , too . the legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the @entity37 , but there are even more contractors working in support of the @entity45 and other @entity50 agencies . the special inspector general for @entity18 , @entity163 produced a report in february titled @entity165 : the @entity166 . he then testified before @entity168 that " the @entity50 government was unprepared and ill - equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in @entity18 in 2003 . for the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve . " he also told members of @entity168 that the @entity50 relies too heavily on the hired help , testifying that " outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations . " something that retired lt. gen. @entity182 would undoubtedly agree with . @entity182 , who led the @entity50 military operation in the early days of the @entity18 war , has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate . he 's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees . guess what . contractors were involved in that scandal , too . as for @entity6 , scandal , or the suspicion of it , played a significant role in its downturn . plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations , the company now called @entity6 is a shell of what @entity6 was five years ago . most of @entity5 's top executives are gone , budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots , as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces . is @entity6 's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry ? hardly . as @entity129 's @entity128 puts it , they 're here to stay , its about time we made it work . " i think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we 're going to be working with the private sector . nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs , guarding gates , that kind of thing .

work by @entity16 - winning cartoonist shows jack - booted figure , @placeholder star with fangs	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- two leading @entity2 watchdog groups are denouncing a prominent cartoonist 's illustration about @entity6 's offensive in @entity7 , saying it uses anti-semitic imagery . the cartoon was published wednesday in newspapers and on the @entity11 . the @entity12 , which has been fighting anti-semitism since it was founded in 1913 , called the syndicated cartoon by @entity16 - winning @entity15 " hideously anti-semitic . " the @entity17 , which , among other things , fights anti-semitism and educates people about the @entity21 , said " the cartoon mimics the venomous anti-semitic propaganda of the @entity24 and @entity26 eras . " published wednesday in newspapers and on the @entity11 , the cartoon shows the small figure of a woman , labeled @entity7 , carrying a child . she is being pursued by a headless , jackbooted figure wielding a sword , marching in an apparent goose - step and pushing a fanged @entity2 star on a wheel . the @entity12 said the cartoon used " @entity24 - like imagery " and a " hateful evocation of the @entity41 . " @entity42 , the @entity12 's national director , said the cartoon 's " outlandish and offensive use of the @entity41 in combination with @entity24 - like imagery is hideously anti-semitic . " " it employs @entity24 imagery by portraying @entity6 as a jack - booted , goose - stepping headless apparition , " @entity42 said . " the implication is of an @entity6 policy without a head or a heart . @entity6 's defensive military operation to protect the lives of its men , women and children who are being continuously bombarded by @entity60 rocket attacks has been turned on its head to show the victims as heartless , headless aggressors . " the @entity17 , which also issued its statement wednesday , said it urged @entity66 web site and other web sites to remove the cartoon . " there is nothing about @entity15 's cartoon not meant to denigrate and demonize the jewish state , from the headless goose - stepping soldier to the horrific depiction of the @entity41 about to devour a cowering innocent @entity7 woman holding a baby , " rabbi @entity69 , the group 's dean , and rabbi @entity72 , the group 's associate dean , said in a joint statement . " the imagery in this cartoon mimics the venomous anti-semitic propaganda of the @entity24 and @entity26 eras . it is cartoons like this that inspired millions of people to hate in the 1930 's and help set the stage for the @entity24 genocide , " the statement said . a spokeswoman for @entity96 , which distributes @entity15 's work , issued a statement defending him , saying he , " like all editorial cartoonists , uses his art to comment on important issues of the day widely reported in the worldwide media -- in this case , the conflict over @entity7 . that his cartoons sometimes spark intense debate is a testament to his talent . " @entity96 said no media outlet had informed the syndicate that it removed the cartoon , but " @entity116 's clients are not contractually bound to inform us . " a @entity66 spokeswoman said , " we did not run the cartoon in the newspaper , nor do we plan to do so . " she said @entity121 has , by contract with uclick.com , an " @entity116 " button on the cartoons page . " yesterday , those who clicked on it saw the cartoon you mentioned , which is now relegated to the @entity116 archive , " she said . imagery and rhetoric comparing @entity6 to @entity133 have been deployed by @entity6 's persistent critics , who decry the jewish state 's treatment of @entity137 as oppressive and brutal . @entity6 and its supporters defend the state as humane and say it has properly defended itself against attacks . there has been sharp criticism of @entity6 's offensive against @entity60 militants in @entity7 who launched rockets into southern @entity6 towns . @entity147 said wednesday the @entity6 military 's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the offensive " was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes , " a claim denied by @entity6 . @entity6 has said that @entity60 militants situated themselves among civilians during the offensive . @entity15 , who won the @entity16 in 1967 , has been a dominant figure in the editorial cartoon world . his work has been distributed since 1980 by @entity96 , which calls the @entity162 native one of the " sharpest , most daring practitioners " among editorial cartoonists . he has received many honors , and his cartoons have been exhibited across the world . " in 1998 , the @entity168 commemorated the acquisition of 60 of his works with a special exhibition at the @entity168 's @entity173 , " according to an @entity15 biography on the @entity96 web site . this is n't the first time @entity15 's cartoons have drawn criticism . the @entity183 in 2005 " wrote to the @entity179 and @entity96 to communicate concern over racist depictions of @entity182 , " according to the group 's web site , and the @entity186 criticized offensive stereotypes in cartoons in 1999 , 2001 and 2007 . debates over offensive editorial cartoons are not uncommon . @entity191 , dean of faculty at the @entity193 , a journalism school in @entity194 , @entity195 , was asked to comment on the reaction to the cartoon , whether the cartoon was improper , and at what point in the editorial process an editor can say a product has gone too far . he said he understands the positions the @entity2 groups and @entity6 policy critics bring to the table . he said he believes @entity15 is saying that " @entity6 is behaving toward the @entity137 the way the @entity133 behaved toward the @entity2 " and that he is stating an opinion shared by many in the @entity210 and the world . " i believe that like the caricatures they are , editorial cartoons by their nature exaggerate their messages , so i do n't think @entity15 is suggesting a one - to - one comparison . so i get the message , instead , that @entity6 is acting brutally toward the @entity137 . " he also believes the @entity12 and the @entity17 " are saying that the cartoon is at least doing unintentional harm ( if not more calculated harm ) . " " i see their point . there are symbols -- and the @entity24 extermination of the @entity2 is surely one of them -- that can only truly be analogized to their equals . unadulterated evil compared with unadulterated evil . @entity6 's ongoing battles with its @entity182 neighbors may be many things , but it is not @entity235 . " as for the question of how news organizations should handle and discuss such a cartoon , @entity191 said that " @entity15 clearly has the right to provoke or offend . the question for him is : do you truly wish to conflate a complex , historic conflict with one of the most evil acts in history ? and for the newspapers that carry the cartoon -- and their behavior here is equally open to critique -- do you wish to perpetuate such a comparison ?

a 12 - 0 vote by jury is required to execute @placeholder by lethal injection	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 and her legal team began fighting for her life tuesday when a new jury heard opening arguments on whether she should receive a life or death sentence for her murder conviction . it 's been a long legal journey for @entity13 , 34 , whom a jury found guilty last year of first - degree murder in the gruesome killing of ex-boyfriend @entity1 , 30 . this week 's court proceeding in @entity19 is a retrial of the penalty phase . in 2013 , the same jury that convicted her became deadlocked later on whether she should be executed for the 2008 murder of @entity25 , who was stabbed 29 times , shot in the face and had his neck slit from ear to ear . the impasse came when the jury voted 8 - 4 in favor of the death penalty for @entity13 , a source with knowledge of the jury 's vote said at the time . " the tale of this relationship is one of infinite sadness , " @entity13 's lawyer , @entity41 , told the jury @entity42 . " the story of this relationship is one of tragedy , friendship , spirituality , lust , passion , forbidden sex , abuse and violence . " @entity41 said @entity13 went through an abusive childhood and developed a personality disorder early in life but had never committed a crime before the killing . she also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of @entity25 , he said . she is very remorseful and is punishing herself , he said . the only appropriate sentence is life in prison , @entity41 concluded . the prosecutor in the case , @entity73 , cast doubt on @entity13 's feelings toward @entity25 , saying " she loved him so much that after she slaughtered him she showed up at his memorial service . " @entity73 described the brutality of the slaying , telling the jury that @entity13 stabbed @entity25 first in the chest while he was nude in the shower , then continued to stab him in the back when he was already bleeding and leaning over the bathroom sink . after making his opening argument , @entity73 called police officers as the first witnesses . they showed the jury photos of the bloody scene in the bathroom . a death penalty requires a unanimous vote by the 12 jurors , and during the penalty retrial , a similar 12 - 0 vote will be required if @entity13 is to die by lethal injection , said @entity98 , spokesman for the @entity99 . during the retrial , if all 12 jurors ca n't vote for death , then @entity13 will be eligible for one of two life sentences : life without the possibility of release or life with the possibility of release after 25 calendar years , @entity98 said . that means @entity13 and her legal team will need to persuade only one of the 12 jurors to vote against the death penalty for her to be spared from execution , @entity98 said . the judge swore in six men and 12 women as jurors for the penalty phase . nobody knows , not even the jurors , which of them will be the 12 to actually make a decision about @entity13 's life . graphic testimony expected the 12 jurors and eight alternates are expected to hear evidence for three to six weeks , @entity98 said . that testimony wo n't rehash whether @entity13 committed murder . that 's already been decided . rather , the jury will hear evidence from the prosecution on why a death sentence is warranted and from the defense on how @entity13 ' background and relationship with @entity25 pose mitigations favoring a life sentence , @entity98 said . nevertheless , the testimony is expected to be gruesome and grisly because prosecutors must show the murder was done in a " cruel , depraved or heinous " manner , among other factors , @entity98 said . " the state will be arguing and building on that theme , " @entity98 said . @entity13 ' legal team is arguing that life is " the appropriate penalty " for the convicted murderer for a number of reasons , according to court papers they filed this month . her legal team notes that @entity13 has no prior criminal history . she was only 27 when she killed @entity25 and has since been remorseful , according to court papers . she also has a psychological makeup that " impaired her ability to cope with the tumultuous relationship she had with mr. @entity25 , " court papers said . no live telecast until verdict unlike the 2013 trial , the penalty retrial wo n't be televised live . rather , judge @entity172 , who will preside over the retrial as she did in the 2013 trial , has ruled that while tv cameras will be permitted in the retrial , no video can be aired until a verdict has been rendered . the judge 's decision came after the defense argued that live tv coverage would keep their witnesses from testifying . the 2013 trial was sensational , attracting a media circus and a national audience riveted by themes of sex , violence and 18 days of testimony by @entity13 , who detailed what she called an abusive relationship with @entity25 but claimed she remembered nothing of his killing . public fascination the trial also featured phone sex conversations between @entity13 and her boyfriend as well as video of her interrogation by police . the public also became fascinated with @entity13 because she took the stand in her defense . more recently , she sought to act as her own attorney in the penalty phase retrial and was initially granted permission in august . but @entity13 changed her mind in september . during last year 's trial , jurors and the public saw @entity13 on video making a number of declarations to police investigating the murder . " i 'm not a murderer , " she told detectives . " if i killed @entity220 , i would beg for the death penalty . " the police video also showed her doing bizarre behavior when left alone in a police room : she began stretching and doing handstands . in another police interview , @entity13 blamed @entity25 's killing on intruders . " they did n't discuss much , they just argued , " @entity13 told a detective . " about what ? " the detective said . " about whether or not to kill me . " " for what reason ? " " because i 'm a witness , " @entity13 said on video . then came a moment of high courtroom drama : the packed gallery sat in stunned disbelief when @entity13 took the stand in her defense . " did you kill @entity1 on june 4th , 2008 ? " the attorney asked her . " yes , i did , " she said . " why ? " " um , the simple answer is that he attacked me , and i defended myself , " @entity13 said . but the jury did n't buy it and convicted her of first - degree murder .	@entity220:Travis	@entity1:Travis Alexander	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Arias	@entity42:onTuesday	@entity25:Alexander	@entity19:Arizona	@entity172:Sherry Stephens	@entity41:Nurmi	@entity99:Maricopa County Attorney 's Office	@entity98:Cobb	@entity73:Martinez

the private contractor renamed itself @placeholder earlier this year	@entity6	@entity0 is an executive producer at @entity1 as well as author of the book " @entity4 : @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 " ( @entity8 , june 2009 ) . @entity5 , founder of @entity6 , is pictured in @entity9 in november 2007 . ( @entity1 ) -- the private military contractor formerly known as @entity6 has held classified contracts with the @entity12 for nearly a decade , but an allegation that the contractor was part of a secret @entity12 program to kill @entity18 operatives -- if true -- would take the relationship to a whole new level . the @entity12 hired the private security firm @entity6 in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top @entity18 leaders , a source familiar with the program told @entity1 . former company executives deny knowing about the program . current leaders of the company did not return calls to @entity1 . the @entity12 wo n't comment on classified contracts . the classified program , canceled by @entity12 director @entity32 earlier this year , was part of a broader effort inside the @entity12 to develop the capacity to conduct training , surveillance and possible covert operations overseas , according to the source . the program was outsourced to contractors to " put some distance " between the effort and the @entity45 government . other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program , another source said , and @entity6 's involvement ended by mid- 2006 . but one thing is clear : the company that renamed itself @entity6 earlier this year in an effort to escape controversy surrounding a 2007 shooting in @entity56 that left 17 @entity57 dead has had a long relationship with the world 's most famous spy agency . when @entity5 first opened his @entity6 training facility in the late ' 90s , his clients included special forces teams and law enforcement agencies from around the country . @entity5 had expressed frustration with the training facilities he visited during his time as a @entity70 , and a sizable inheritance allowed him the financial freedom to retire from the military and try his hand at creating a better facility . his first clients were indeed seal teams . but they also included teams from other government agencies , including the @entity12 . case officers and protection details , the people generally accustomed to working in the shadows , began showing up for training on the shooting range or the driving track in a rural part of @entity88 . when then - @entity12 executive director @entity90 , whose own son was a @entity70 , visited the facility , former @entity6 president @entity89 suggested he meet with @entity5 , who worked out of an office in the @entity95 area . the two had lunch and @entity90 immediately took a liking to the man who would later lead the world 's most notorious private contracting company . at the time , contacts like these were essential to building the business , so when terror struck the heart of @entity45 in september 2001 , @entity5 called up his new friend @entity90 and offered to help . sources inside the agency at the time say that @entity90 in fact , was pushing hard for @entity6 to be given the first urgent and compelling , no - bid contract to protect @entity12 facilities in @entity9 . the military , it seems , was n't up to the task of staffing such an effort . once awarded the initial contract , @entity5 maintained a close relationship with @entity90 , and made trips to @entity9 to make sure things were going smoothly . the idea that the agency came to @entity6 for help on any other contracts , including one with the overall goal of locating and assassinating @entity18 operatives , would n't come as a huge surprise , particularly since so much of the intelligence budget is spent on private contractors . but with investigations under way into just what was done and by whom at the @entity12 under the @entity137 administration , people are remaining tight - lipped . especially under the threat of possible prosecution , should it go that far .	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Suzanne Simons	@entity7:Business of War	@entity6:Xe	@entity5:Prince	@entity4:Master of War	@entity9:Afghanistan	@entity8:Collins	@entity18:al Qaeda	@entity45:America	@entity32:Leon Panetta	@entity57:Iraqis	@entity56:Baghdad	@entity12:CIA	@entity88:North Carolina	@entity89:Gary Jackson	@entity95:Washington	@entity70:Navy SEAL	@entity137:Bush	@entity90:Krongard
slain maj. @entity19 accused in @placeholder shootings	@entity6	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 knows the drill . when news first broke thursday that a shooting at @entity6 , @entity7 , killed and injured @entity9 soldiers , the national communications director for the @entity11 wrote a statement of condemnation . he only sent it out later , when reports emerged that the alleged shooter 's name was maj. @entity19 . " as soon as we saw what appeared to be a @entity23 name , we issued our statement , " @entity2 said . " until that time , we were praying that no @entity23 would be involved . " that 's the reality of crisis management for the @entity28 community , said @entity2 , who handles communications for the nation 's largest @entity23 civil rights and advocacy group . even without confirmation that the alleged gunman was @entity23 -- there was no immediate determination of any religious affiliation for @entity19 -- the mere reporting of a possible @entity23 name required an immediate comment , he said . " that 's unfortunately the world we live in nowadays , " @entity2 said . " so often , muslims are accused of not condemning these kind of acts . " the @entity11 statement said : " no political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence . the attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all - volunteer @entity50 that protects our nation . @entity9 @entity23 stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured . " in a separate statement , the @entity58 , based in @entity59 , @entity60 , condemned what it called the " heinous incident . " " we are in contact with law enforcement and @entity9 federal government officials to gain more facts from this tragic incident and work together in dealing with its aftermath , " the group said . its statement called on " all members of @entity28 communities to be in contact with local law enforcement for the safety and security of their communities and their institutions . " the @entity81 also issued a statement " in conjunction with all the major @entity23 organizations nationwide " that condemned the attack . " while several news reports have cited one of the gunmen to be @entity50 maj. @entity19 , @entity81 strongly emphasizes that this attack and its perpetrator are in no way representative of the @entity23 people or the peace - loving religion of @entity98 , " the statement said . " the individuals who perpetrated this attack blatantly acted against the teachings of @entity98 and humanity , " it added . after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity9 , @entity23 - @entity9 reported increased attacks and threats by revenge - minded non-muslims . " we 've seen this before , " @entity2 said of a possible backlash . " whenever there 's an incident of this type , there 's always the possibility this will happen . " even non-muslims could be targeted , he said , noting that @entity117 who wear turbans or hispanic - americans can be mistaken as being of @entity121 descent . on thursday night , @entity11 executive director @entity122 told a news conference the alleged @entity6 attacker 's motive remained unknown .

@entity0 fans face spiraling expenses , visa anxiety ahead of @placeholder final	@entity6	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity0 football fans hoping to travel to @entity4 for this month 's @entity6 final between @entity7 and @entity8 face spiraling costs and an anxious wait for visas amid a simmering diplomatic row between the @entity13 and @entity14 . @entity8 fans hoping to follow their side to @entity4 face hefty expenses and an anxious wait over visas . upwards of 50,000 fans are expected to travel to the may 21 match from the @entity13 , defying expensive flights and warnings about a shortage of accommodation in the @entity14 capital -- one of the world 's most expensive cities . but there were fears on thursday that @entity14 's stringent visa requirements for @entity13 citizens could further complicate matters for fans . in a statement , the @entity37 in @entity1 pledged to fulfil its obligations to enable all fans with tickets to the game to travel . but it also criticized the @entity13 government for tightening restrictions on @entity14 traveling in the opposite direction , imposed following the apparent murder of the exiled @entity14 dissident @entity47 in 2006 . " if we had an agreement similar to the one @entity14 has in place with @entity53 , most problems could have been avoided , " the statement said . the embassy also criticized the @entity13 for imposing " cumbersome " visa requirements on supporters of the @entity14 side , @entity58 , which could reach the @entity60 final in @entity61 on may 14 , including biometric tests , online - only applications and interviews with consulate officials . but there was speculation as well on thursday that @entity4 may be prepared to temporarily lift some visa requirements in a gesture of good will . the @entity13 's @entity72 newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that @entity14 authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders . @entity60 communications director @entity82 praised @entity14 's flexibility on wednesday and said a simplified visa application procedure could be in place by the end of the week . " the @entity14 have shown great flexibility and hopefully within the next 48 hours we will be announcing a more simplified procedure for visas to make it easier for fans to get to @entity4 , " @entity82 told the @entity13 's @entity87 . @entity7 chief executive @entity94 said on wednesday that those traveling on official club packages were assured of a visa . " if you are on an organized trip , your ticket will be your visa . the actual specifics and fine details will be addressed in the next day or so and then we will communicate with the fans . " everyone recognizes in order for it to be a showcase , which it clearly will be , you have to ease entry into the country while not totally doing away with what the @entity14 authorities require . " but @entity112 warned that demand for tickets would leave many fans disappointed : " we could sell well over 100,000 tickets for this final , so there will be a lot of disappointed people . " both @entity7 and @entity8 have each received around 21,000 tickets for the match . but with officially allocated tickets expected to be snapped up by season ticket holders and loyalty scheme members , many more fans are expected to travel to @entity4 independently . flights from @entity1 to @entity4 on the day of the match , returning the following day were available for around $ 1,600 over the internet on thursday . but the @entity13 foreign office web site advised thursday that there were no hotel vacancies in @entity4 and warned supporters that they would not be able to find a room on arrival . meanwhile , @entity13 sports minister @entity135 urged fans to be on their best behavior in @entity4 , warning that trouble could derail @entity0 's bid to host the 2018 @entity140 . " i was really impressed and pleased that the @entity143 champions final will be an all - @entity0 final but that brings some responsibilities for the teams involved and their supporters , " @entity135 told @entity141 . " it should be a great advert for the @entity150 and for @entity0 football but it will also be the place everyone will be looking at if anything goes wrong . " if that happened it would not only be damaging for the two teams participating but could also have a big impact on the reputation of our game at a time when we are trying to encourage football nations to support our @entity140 bid . " with the match due to kick off at 2245 local time , the @entity13 foreign office web site advised supporters " not to let alcohol spoil their @entity6 final experience , " pointing out that smoking and drinking in @entity171 are illegal . " the @entity174 is providing detailed information for those fans who are traveling , " said minister for europe @entity172 . " so i encourage those who are going , to look at the specific travel advice on how to enjoy a trouble - free and successful visit to @entity4 .

he says sometimes @placeholder 's @entity91 savior , @entity3 , does n't seem to take it very seriously	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- if the @entity3 followed the @entity5 presidential elections as avidly as the @entity5 stare at the poll ratings of @entity8 and @entity9 , they would know that " @entity10 , " @entity10 the @entity3 , may soon have to say " good bye " to the @entity11 . the omens are bad and the possible demise of the most pro-american president in our history raises questions about our long and complex transatlantic relations . how will @entity5 election be decided ? not that there is so much to worry about . @entity10 's potential successor , the @entity22 , may have said that " the enemy is finance , " but he also told the @entity23 that before attending @entity24 , the alma mater of our elite public service , he had traveled to the @entity3 and written a report on the @entity3 fast food industry that foresaw the triumph of @entity30 's in @entity5 a decade later . the candidate even admitted a personal weakness for hamburgers -- a strategic cliché @entity3 is welcome to take as a token of transatlantic loyalty . but it is not always enough . remember @entity40 ? our former president gained real popularity in the @entity3 after telling @entity44 that in his youth he had worked as a soda jerk at a @entity48 hotel , and even dangerously overextended his vacations to date a southern belle who called him " @entity54 " and drove him around in a white @entity53 convertible . all this sincere devotion to @entity56 did n't spare him from being reviled later as the commander - in - chief of the " @entity58 " , unwilling to risk blood and treasure in the quest of weapons of mass destruction in @entity63 . tons of " @entity72 , " the creative rants of @entity65 and @entity66 , even the sad visit to the @entity68 in 2004 of our then ambassador to check officially on the status of @entity5 ( " @entity74 ? " ) are enough proof that our relations can become sour and chaotic overnight . but hateful ? no. it 's just ... complicated . @entity78 , the man in the middle in 2004 , sincerely thought @entity3 and @entity5 could form a bona fide couple , be it " in therapy for the last 60 years . " and if the first rule of therapy is to verbalize , @entity5 has been vocal , to say the least . the official @entity5 explanation is that we both have strong and " radiating " cultures . the reality is that history has not made us equal . and it is sometimes painful . it was made worse , and personal , by @entity91 , when presidents @entity92 and @entity93 did n't embrace @entity94 , the only remnant of dignity of a battered country and the only symbolic redemption of a past that included a shaming defeat , a cruel occupation and the moral abyss of collaboration by @entity104 and @entity5 police . sure , @entity3 saved us . but it is sometimes hard to be saved , especially when your savior does n't seem to take you very seriously . no wonder the @entity5 flirted with grandiosity in the 1960s . the interior conquest made up for the loss of a colonial empire . the social protection , the nuclear show of force , the state - owned companies , the glowing technocratic elite and appeals to the developing world confirmed the victorious march of our " @entity124 " between @entity126 and @entity127 . it is one of the reasons why , in contrast to most other western countries , the @entity5 conservative parties and its establishment never saw the @entity3 entrepreneurial way of business as a suitable model . it was even seen as a little vulgar . the change came with @entity10 . his bourgeois but simple upbringing , his father 's foreign origin made him an unlikely candidate for the elite and all the more sensitive to the growth , creativity and class promotion promised by the @entity3 capitalism and meritocracy . he was also the first to suggest a system of affirmative action for the young descendants of immigrants locked in ghettos by decades of neglect and racism . but " @entity10 " became less @entity3 after the collapse of the markets in 2008 , less prone to show to @entity5 , as a model , a country where citizens actually demonstrate against government - run healthcare , less inclined to diversity when he needed the extreme right vote for his re-election . there was also a disappointment . if our president had gotten along much better than @entity40 with @entity66 since 2007 , he had great hopes to bask in the world aura of @entity9 , and even to replace the @entity178 as the closest ally of the @entity3 . that did not happen . a rational and aloof @entity9 kept the unprecedented @entity5 love fest at bay . " the most @entity3 of the two is not who you would think , " a diplomat whispered to me after one of their first meetings , strangely mixing admiration , irony and plain old stereotypes . once again , @entity5 seemed to need the big mirror across the @entity195 to shape its identity and solve its anxieties . a colleague swore to me that @entity199 's @entity200 for " @entity201 " would offset the loss of our triple - a credit rating . in the middle of the @entity208 sex scandal last year , half of the @entity5 sneered at the " @entity209 " and its disgusting @entity210 . the other half admired a country that would treat a rich and powerful man as badly as the common man . but both sides agreed to buy a magazine cover story that asked : " the @entity3 , what do they think of us ?

1 @entity8 win over @entity9 in @entity11 qualifying . the @entity13 striker was hit by allegations about his private life in the @entity17 press at the weekend but shrugged off the controversy to register his first goal for @entity1 in 11 games . he converted @entity22 's cross to open the scoring before @entity25 winger @entity24 made it 2 - 0 in the second half after @entity9 's @entity27 had been sent off . though 18 - year - old @entity28 pulled one back for the hosts with a spectacular strike , @entity33 striker @entity32 made the game safe with a late third for @entity1 . in the group 's other game @entity37 's goal was enough to hand @entity40 a surprise 1 - 0 in @entity42 . managerless @entity43 continued their disappointing start to the campaign as they were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity46 in @entity47 coach @entity48 is serving a six - month ban following an incident involving an anti-doping team before the @entity52 and in his absence @entity43 are struggling . @entity54 scored the only goal of the game after 21 minutes to leave @entity43 with just one point from two games as @entity46 went top . @entity59 netted a late winner for @entity61 as they beat @entity63 in the group 's other game . @entity65 bounced back from their shock defeat to @entity68 on friday by winning 2 -

@placeholder says she lived two lives in the @entity2 , wondering if each day was the last	@entity156	( @entity0 ) -- when i first joined the @entity2 , i had no idea that i was gay . i was well into my career when i realized this fact , but i was doing well as evidenced by the awards and promotions i was receiving . in addition , i really enjoyed what i was doing and felt i was making a difference . so i opted to continue to serve , even though i knew that i would have to hide my true identity . for most of my career in the @entity2 , i lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last . whenever the admiral would call me to his office , 99.9 percent of me was certain that it was to discuss an operational issue . but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that somehow i had been " outed , " and he was calling me to his office to tell me that i was fired . so many simple things that straight people take for granted could have ended my career , even a comment such as " my partner and i went to the movies last night . " do you think " do n't ask , do n't tell " should be reversed ? in spite of the stress of living under " do n't ask , do n't tell " and the constant fear of losing my job , somehow my partner , @entity37 , an openly gay reference librarian at the @entity39 , and i had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices . i had pretended to be straight and played the games most gays in the military are all too familiar with -- not daring to have a picture of @entity37 on my desk , being reluctant to go out to dinner with her , telling her not to call me at work except in a real emergency , not going to church together , avoiding shopping for groceries together and generally staying out of sight of anyone i knew when we were together . i did n't want to have to lie about who @entity37 was or have someone conclude that we were more than casual friends . but it was the events of september 11 , 2001 , that caused me to appreciate fully the true impact of " do n't ask , do n't tell " on our lives . at 8:30 a.m. on september 11 , i went to a meeting in the @entity67 . at 9:30 a.m. i left that meeting . at 9:37 a.m. , @entity68 77 slammed into the @entity67 and destroyed the exact space i had left less than eight minutes earlier , killing seven of my colleagues . in the days and weeks that followed , i went to several funerals and memorial services for shipmates who had been killed . most of my co-workers attended these services with their spouses whose support was critical at this difficult time , yet i was forced to go alone . as the numbness began to wear off , it hit me how incredibly alone @entity37 would have been had i been killed . the military is known for how it pulls together and helps people ; we talk of the " military family , " which is a way of saying we always look after each other , especially in times of need . but none of that support would have been available for @entity37 , because under " @entity94 , " she could n't exist . in fact , @entity37 would have been one of the last people to know had i been killed , because nowhere in my paperwork or emergency contact information had i dared to list her name . this realization caused us to stop and reassess exactly what was most important in our lives . during that process , we realized that the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was causing us to make a much bigger sacrifice than either of us had ever admitted . eight months later , in june 2002 , i retired after more than 29 years in the @entity2 , an organization i will always love and respect . we are now committed to doing everything we possibly can to get rid of " do n't ask , do n't tell " so that our military can finally be open to all qualified and motivated individuals who want to serve their country . as a retired naval officer , i am especially pleased with the leadership that @entity2 adm. @entity114 , chairman of the @entity115 , has demonstrated on repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell . " i believe that the end of the policy is in sight . i have every confidence that our military will easily adjust to this change and that with strong leadership , we will ultimately be stronger and better for it . ironically , it was in the military that i learned to work with people of different backgrounds , different religions , different ethnicities and different skin colors and to focus on getting the mission accomplished . i learned the importance of respecting everyone and judging people on their performance and abilities , not on a preconceived prejudice . twenty - six countries allow gays to serve openly in their militaries , and from all reports , things are going just fine . this is the right step for our country , our military and for gay people both currently serving and those who would like to be part of the world 's finest military . i have great love and respect for our country , but i know we can do better than " do n't ask , do n't tell .

baby golden eagle was burned in a @placeholder wildfire	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- the resilience of a burned baby golden eagle that survived a @entity4 wildfire is astounding wildlife rehabilitators nursing him back to health . " the trauma and the injury and the situation he is in -- to come out of it is amazing , " said @entity8 , executive director of the @entity9 in @entity10 . all of the eaglet 's feathers , even on his head , were charred . he also suffered burns to the feet and around his beak . his improbable story began june 1 , when a volunteer who documents eagles placed a band on the bird . the @entity28 erupted three weeks later , burning more than 5,500 acres south of @entity29 and west of @entity31 . @entity32 returned in late june to the nest , built on the edge of the cliff , thinking he would recover the band from a deceased animal . the nest on @entity39 was gone , the rocks behind it blackened by the blaze . @entity32 then spotted legs and talons near a scorched juniper below . amazingly , the baby eagle was alive . near him were rabbit and squirrel carcasses , evidence his parents had tried to feed him after disaster struck . fortunately , his eyes had not been burned . wildfire victims face second tragedy @entity32 said he has thought of the horror the helpless nestling might have felt when flames approached . " he had enough courage to jump from that nest and try to save himself anyway , " said @entity32 , 56 , who describes himself as an amateur ornithologist . " he is a real fighter . " the fall was about 25 feet , and the eagle probably walked back to the base of the cliff after rolling another 100 feet , said @entity32 . the bird remained in the area for several days while @entity32 , who is authorized to band raptors , sought permission from federal and state authorities to obtain care for him . on wednesday , @entity32 handed the bird over to @entity8 . she and her staff dubbed the survivor " @entity79 " -- a reference to the mythical creature that is reborn from the ashes . there was no food in the craw of the dehydrated eagle , which weighed just over 5 pounds . " he was lethargic and just obviously hurting , " @entity8 told @entity0 on saturday . " after we got him hydrated and medications , he perked up and that fire came back in him . " @entity8 said @entity79 , now about 70 days old , was a handful saturday , lunging and using his talons as caregivers fed and provided antibiotics to the animal . " he 's not grateful , " she quipped . rehabilitators limit their contact with the eagle so that he will not " habituate , " or become too comfortable around people . they use hydrotherapy to help the healing in his feet . " he needs those for hunting . there are lots of tendons and muscles we need to protect , " said @entity8 . golden eagles , which are protected , typically eat reptiles , birds and small mammals , according to the @entity116 . they also are known to scavenge carrion . @entity120 's most destructive fire nears containment @entity32 said golden eagle females are slightly smaller than the more - famous bald eagle and tend to hunt more and scavenge less . their particular favorite prey in northern @entity4 is the black - tailed jackrabbit . the resident of suburban @entity29 studies golden eagles and provides population information to state wildlife authorities . @entity8 called @entity32 " the hero in this story . " it 's too early to tell whether @entity79 will be able to fly in the wild . rehabilitation will take at least a year and his feathers wo n't fully molt until mid- 2013 . " we are fairly confident , but there could be follicle damage we do not know about that would prevent feathers from coming in , " @entity8 said . the nonprofit center , which treats about 1,800 animals a year , is accepting financial and food donations to offset the cost of caring for the golden eagle . " he is doing well and we are very positive about his outcome right now , " said @entity8 . " ( but ) these types of things can turn at any moment . " how to donate in her 12 years of wildlife rehabilitation , @entity8 said , the eagle 's story is among a few cases she considers " nothing short of a miracle .

author @entity1 wrote about @placeholder in ' @entity19 '	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 could not believe his eyes . the man he saw in a @entity5 courtroom last week was stooped and shackled , hardly the same smooth and swaggering @entity6 who had told his story so many years ago . to say the author and the convicted killer have a history would be an understatement . if anything , their first face - to - face meeting in 35 years was anticlimactic . " he looked like a shadow , " @entity1 said of @entity6 , now 68 , who some believe the author betrayed for his 1983 best - selling book " @entity19 . " " he has a pallor , there was no substance to him , " @entity1 continued . " i guess many years in prison can do that to you . " @entity1 testified earlier this month for the prosecution at a federal hearing in @entity30 , @entity5 , that could determine whether or not @entity6 deserves freedom , or at least a new trial . @entity6 's lawyers assert that newly - discovered dna evidence -- three hairs that match neither @entity6 nor any of the victims -- and the secondhand confession of a key witness who claimed to be at the family 's home the night of the murders justify reopening the case . judge hears new evidence in ' @entity19 ' case @entity1 said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be " the @entity48 , " @entity6 's last chance at freedom . he remains convinced of @entity6 's guilt . the attorneys finished their closing arguments on monday , and the decision is now in the hands of @entity57 district judge @entity56 . the judge could let @entity6 's murder convictions stand , toss them out , or order another trial . it is expected to take weeks , perhaps months , before a ruling comes in a criminal saga that has made headlines for four decades . it began when military police officers were summoned to the @entity6 home at @entity69 , @entity5 on february 17 , 1970 . inside , they found a horrific crime scene . @entity6 's pregnant wife , @entity72 , was stabbed 16 times with a knife and 21 times with an ice pick . daughter @entity77 , 5 , was bludgeoned and stabbed in the neck . @entity79 , 2 , was stabbed 48 times ; a finger was nearly severed as she tried to fend off the blows . " it was overkill , " said @entity1 , who wrote that @entity6 killed his family in an amphetamine - fueled rage . @entity6 , a captain assigned to the @entity87 , also sustained a collapsed lung and two stab wounds in what he said was an attack on his family by a trio of intruders , including a woman in a floppy hat who chanted " acid is groovy " and " kill the pigs . " the word " pig " was written in blood on a headboard , a detail reminiscent of the infamous 1969 @entity105 family murders in @entity106 . prosecutors alleged @entity6 staged the crime scene . the @entity109 investigated first , and @entity6 was cleared at a closed military hearing . but his father - in - law pushed civilian authorities to pursue the case and a grand jury indicted @entity6 in 1975 . he was found guilty of murder four years later and is serving a three life sentences . if his appeal fails , he does not become eligible for parole until 2071 . @entity6 has always insisted he is innocent , so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to @entity1 . " he 's a psychopath . he does n't have the kind of emotions that you and i would have , " the author said . " he does n't have the capacity to feel badly about it . these were n't his wife and children . these were people that got in his way . " @entity6 's appeals received renewed attention with the release this month of the book " a wilderness of error : the trials of @entity6 . " written by @entity142 - winning documentary filmmaker @entity143 , the book paints @entity6 as a man wrongly convicted on the basis of incomplete and corrupted evidence , as well as prosecutorial misconduct . " we 've been sold a bill of goods about this case , " said @entity143 . " it 's as phony as a three - dollar bill . " writer seeks to clear @entity6 asked about the controversy , @entity1 was pragmatic in his response . " it does n't matter what i think of what @entity143 thinks , " he said . " @entity6 was convicted by a jury in a court of law . he 's not in prison because of me and he 's not going to get out of prison because of @entity143 . " @entity1 also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in @entity6 when he embarked on " @entity19 . " he says he was embedded with the defense team because he was looking for a different angle . " i thought it would be fascinating to write about the trial from the point of view of how the defense and defendant were experiencing it . i learned everything from the first time in court . i did n't have my mind made up . " @entity1 said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing . " there came a point in the trial when much to my dismay i started to feel this evidence is piling up and @entity6 is n't doing anything to dispute it . by the end it was still very confusing . i said to myself , ' i think this guy did it , ' but he was so charismatic and likable and had such a strong personality . this was before i learned about the psychopathic personality . " @entity1 also disputed the notion raised by the defense and @entity143 that the prosecutor at the criminal trial threatened witness @entity201 to alter her testimony . @entity201 , who died in 1983 , had admitted to others that she was present for the killings but she denied it on the witness stand at @entity6 's trial . watching @entity6 in court again reminded @entity1 of how much has changed in the three decades since he last laid eyes on him . " it was in 1987 during the trial of the civil suit against me , " @entity1 said . " he was allowed to wear a new suit of clothes . he looked like the host of a daytime game show . " in the civil case , @entity6 accused the author of breaching an agreement to write a book about his innocence . the jury deadlocked and the case was settled out of court for a reported $ 325,000 . journalist @entity225 wrote a widely read article about the case and was critical of @entity1 , accusing him of deceiving @entity6 by pretending to believe he was innocent after becoming convinced of his guilt . @entity1 now has another controversial book out , " @entity228 , " a biography of @entity230 . in court , @entity6 literally seemed to @entity1 to be a ghost from the past . " the years since have not treated him kindly , " he said . " he sat there at the end of the table and was whispering . he seemed insubstantial . " i looked at him but he would never look me in the eyes . "	@entity87:Green Berets	@entity1:McGinniss	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:MacDonald	@entity5:North Carolina	@entity57:U.S.	@entity56:John C.

@placeholder , aid agencies scramble for alternative because ship is nearing capacity	@entity6	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 being treated on a @entity4 hospital ship are requiring longer care than expected , forcing the @entity6 and other international agencies to scramble for an alternative . the solution involves plans for a 3,000 - to 5,000 - bed temporary hospital on land , for continued care , because the ship is reaching its treatment limit , according to gen. @entity16 , the senior officer in charge of military operations in @entity19 . the @entity20 , the @entity4 's hospital ship sent to assist in aid efforts , has performed more than 200 surgeries and treated more than 1,000 patients injured in the january 12 earthquake , and has been bolstering its medical staff to keep up with the demand . " it 's used up the clinical capacity before we reach the bed - space capacity , " @entity16 , commander of the @entity28 , said at a @entity30 briefing thursday . " the effort that we have ongoing right now for the discharge is looking to put together a facility where we have the ability to recover those patients -- and be able to provide them with that recovery space and time that they need , " @entity16 said . he said the initial effort would be to make a temporary facility on land the @entity2 government has identified , with the facility consisting of tents and cots and whatever other resources can be scrounged together . earlier this week the head of the @entity6 military 's aid relief in @entity2 told reporters the military was assisting in getting together components of a large facility with 3,000 to 5,000 beds , to handle the health needs in @entity2 . lt. gen. @entity61 said the @entity6 military would provide medical equipment , but the @entity64 is working with other aid organizations to staff it and contractors to build it . it 's not clear where the hospital will be but military officials say it will be just outside of the capital , @entity74 . some patients discharged from the ship to continue care at home have no home to recover in , according to witnesses . gen. @entity16 said the @entity6 government 's joint task force in @entity2 is working in a , " very concerted effort " to put the medical facility together . the @entity4 is also taking care of patients on three other ships -- the @entity89 , a aircraft carrier ; the @entity91 ; and the @entity92 . the ships are supporting efforts in other parts of the quake - ravaged country and are complete with operating rooms and dozens of hospital beds and medical personnel . " we 'll look to see how we can improve this better . but it 's an ongoing process because of the magnitude of the need , the difficulties as we 're working through the infrastructure to meet the needs , " @entity16 said . @entity16 , talking about the cost of the operation , said he had not been placed under any financial limits . " the focus is on meeting the needs of the @entity2 people , " he said . in response to criticism that there were still people who have not been able to receive food or aid , @entity16 said he does not have an accurate number of how many or exactly where they might be . " we 're still having to move around and find those pockets for food distribution , and so it 's really a communication and a continuing effort to get out to every spot that there is in the country , " he said .	@entity2:Haitian	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:U.S.	@entity16:Fraser	@entity28:U.S. Southern Command	@entity4:U.S. Navy	@entity20:USNS Comfort	@entity19:South America	@entity64:United Nations	@entity74:Port-au-Prince	@entity89:USS Carl Vinson	@entity30:Pentagon	@entity92:USS Bataan	@entity91:USS Nassau	@entity61:P.K.

" this pattern is risky and unjustified . so @entity2 remains vigilant . we are here . and we are ready to defend all allies against any threat , " he said at @entity22 in @entity17 , where @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity17 troops were gathered . @entity10 said few of the @entity6 flights had actually violated the airspace of @entity2 nations , but he said the way the @entity6 planes operate threatens civilian aviation in the region . " they are not filing their air flight plans . they are not turning on the transponders . and they are not communicating with the civilian air traffic control , " he said . " we are calling on @entity6 to conduct their military air activities in a responsible way and respecting international norms for this kind of air activity , " @entity10 said . in a report earlier this month , the @entity50 listed more than 40 " close military encounters between @entity6 and the @entity53 " that took place in the eight months from march to october of this year . three of those , including a near collision between a @entity6 military plane and a @entity60 passenger aircraft carrying 132 people , were classified as " high - risk " incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between @entity6 and the @entity53 , according to the report , titled " @entity65 . " @entity6 also has said it will expand its military flights , with defense minister @entity67 saying this month that @entity6 military aircraft would be flying along @entity24 coasts and even into the @entity70 . " we have to maintain ( @entity6 's ) military presence in the western @entity74 and eastern @entity73 , as well as the @entity75 and the @entity70 , " including sending bombers " as part of the drills , " @entity67 said . @entity10 , continuing his @entity80 trip in @entity2 ally @entity81 on friday , said the alliance is not standing idle as @entity6 activity increases . visiting the @entity84 , he said @entity2 's air policing mission in the region " has been significantly strengthened in the recent months .

" the small handful of @entity4 military personnel operating in @entity6 will be withdrawn to @entity30 after @entity6 's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay , " the spokesman said . @entity6 must give its permission for foreign troops to be on its soil . it was a group of @entity6 lawmakers loyal to anti-american shiite cleric @entity45 that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on @entity4 troops . they walked out of parliament as a group on july 11 , depriving the legislature of the minimum number of lawmakers necessary for votes to take place . @entity58 is now on summer recess until september 8 . @entity60 , a lawmaker from the @entity45 bloc , confirmed that the bloc reject the @entity6 - @entity4 security agreement . he said that @entity6 does not need the @entity4 troops and that @entity6 security forces are ready to handle security on their own . @entity4 hopes the @entity6 parliament will eventually approve the security agreement . " while this delay is unfortunate , we are continuing to seek a solution with the @entity6 government that will provide our forces with the sound legal basis they need , " the ministry said in a written statement . the @entity4 troops who are being pulled out include @entity77 servicemen who have been helping the @entity6 to protect oil fields around the port town of @entity80 , according to the @entity3 spokesman . all @entity4 combat troops have already left the country , another ministry spokesman told @entity2 . there were about 46,000 @entity4 troops in and around @entity6 at the peak of major combat operations in march and april 2003 , according to the @entity3 . @entity2 's @entity90 in @entity1 and @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity6 , contributed to this report .	@entity3:Ministry of Defence	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:London	@entity0:England	@entity26:NATO	@entity6:Iraqi	@entity4:British	@entity80:Umm Qasr	@entity45:Sadr	@entity77:Royal Navy	@entity60:Fawzi Akram	@entity30:Kuwait	@entity58:Parliament	@entity92:Baghdad	@entity91:Youssif Basil	@entity90:Jonathan Wald

the @entity1 vow to leave @placeholder in 2017 , moving to @entity24	@entity93	the @entity1 have decided to leave the limits of their namesake city because they got " a terrific deal , " mayor @entity0 said -- one that was sweeter than he felt comfortable supporting for fear of hurting his municipal government long - term . " we wanted the @entity1 to stay in @entity11 , but ( there was a ) business problem that we had to solve , " @entity0 said tuesday . " that choice was encumbering between $ 150 million and $ 250 million in debt and not having money to do anything else . " the mayor chose not to go that route , and partly as a result , the @entity22 franchise is heading about 12 miles north to @entity24 . this new multimillion - dollar stadium , which will be part of a larger retail and entertainment complex , is scheduled to open in 2017 to the northwest , where two major interstates -- @entity30 75 and 285 -- meet , the @entity1 announced monday . @entity11 mayor : cost too high a day later , @entity0 admitted that he was taken aback by the news . while the team and city had been engaged in negotiations over the past 18 months -- and he 'd " still felt that we could get a deal done " -- the mayor said his first indication that something had changed came after being contacted by a @entity1 official on november 6 , a day after his re-election . @entity0 said he learned about the baseball club 's new thinking , including a reported offer of $ 450 million of public financing from @entity24 , the next day . the city of @entity11 was n't asked to put up that much money , nor was it asked to build a new stadium , the mayor said . still , the @entity1 did ask for extensive public investments in the publicly owned stadium and the surrounding area , money that @entity0 said he did n't feel the city could give now , given other needs and the desire to keep spending and debt in check . the mayor pointed specifically to a $ 922 million infrastructure backlog and desires to upgrade roads , expand public spaces and pursue other improvements across the city . " if we made a different decision , " @entity0 said , " every single dollar for everything else would have gone to fund and modernize the stadium . " critics have pointed out that , in recent months , city money has been allocated for another stadium in downtown @entity11 : $ 200 million for a new home for the @entity79 's @entity78 . @entity0 took pains to state that the two stadium deals " candidly are not close . " the @entity78 ' one uses revenue from the city 's hotel - motel tax but does n't tap the government 's general fund , as a @entity1 stadium deal might have done . plus , the mayor added , " i certainly was not going to try to finance two stadium deals at the exact same time . " the team 's contract with @entity93 , which was retrofitted for baseball after the @entity95 , expires in 2016 . club president @entity96 said in a video message that @entity93 needs " hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades . unfortunately , that massive investment would not do anything to improve access or the fan experience . " he vowed that the new stadium site " will be one of the most magnificent in all of baseball . it will thrive with action 365 days a year .

a fictional portrayal of a @placeholder punk scene helped set the real - world stage	@entity17	( @entity0 ) -- the guitarist stands in front of a mirror messing with his mohawk . the drummer strikes a wild tempo . the singer rips off his t - shirt and begins to scream the lyrics . @entity10 is bassist for @entity11 , a group that blends traditional sounds with punk rock beats . they 're young . they 're punk . and they 're rocking both their muslim and @entity19 worlds with their music , lyrics and style . " a lot of times people say , ' oh wow , look , brown people playing music ' [ but ] it 's more than that , " said 25 - year - old @entity23 , the lead singer for a @entity17 punk band , the @entity11 . the @entity32 - based band is one of a handful of @entity17 punk bands that emerged in the @entity19 in the past few years . the members of this four - person rock group with @entity39 roots hold varying views on religion . one says he 's an atheist ; three others identify as @entity44 -- both practicing and non-practicing . for them , punk music is a way to rebel against their conservative cultural upbringing and the frustrations of growing up a young @entity17 in @entity51 . " we are n't [ just ] some alternative to a stereotypical @entity17 . we actually might be offering some sort of insights for people at large about religion , about the world , " said 26 - year - old bassist @entity10 . blending traditional @entity39 rhythms with punk rock beats , they sing in both @entity63 and @entity64 . ( @entity11 means " scum - bag " in @entity64 , according to the band . ) their songs can be at once political , serious , satirical and insinuating . audio slide show : on tour with @entity17 punk rockers » their risqué lyrics and provocative song titles such as " @entity75 in the @entity19 , " " @entity76 " and " @entity77 was a @entity78 " -- a protest song against homophobia in the @entity81 -- have drawn the attention of @entity44 , non-muslims , fans and critics alike . " you sort of have to throw it in peoples ' faces and be shocking in order to give people a different way to think about stuff , " said @entity10 . " these punk , metal and rap scenes - so - called extreme music scenes -- are addressing issues that mainstream music does n't , " said @entity100 , a professor of @entity102 history at @entity103 , who is also a musician and author of " @entity105 . " " [ @entity106 ] allows them to rebel against society and their own culture at the same time , " he said . @entity111 : is @entity112 at odds with @entity19 values ? before the @entity112 punk movement in @entity51 had a voice , it had a story . the @entity17 punk scene began to gel in 2003 when novelist and convert to @entity112 , @entity121 self - published his book , " the @entity124 " about a fictional @entity17 punk scene in @entity126 , @entity127 . the book opens with a poem called " @entity138 was a @entity139 " and describes both conventional and unconventional characters including a @entity132 skinhead , a conservative @entity17 , a burka - wearing feminist punk and a @entity134 who sports a @entity137 and drinks alcohol . " the punk rock kids i would hang out with were n't even @entity17 , " 31 - year old @entity121 recalls . " they were so fiercely individualistic -- i wish that i could be a @entity17 in that way : not be ashamed of my confusion , not be ashamed of my doubts . just be myself and be proud of who i am . " the novel 's title , " @entity147 , " is a hybrid word stemming from the @entity150 " taqwa , " meaning " god consciousness , " and " core " referring to " hardcore " -- a genre of punk music . it 's now a general term for @entity17 punk rock . the popularity of the book , which @entity121 said was born out of a search to find his identity as a @entity163 , grew in underground youth circles and online . it did n't take long before real - life " taqwacore " bands like the @entity11 began blooming across the country . " it makes sense why punk has been the music of choice for young , politically active @entity44 who are musical , " said @entity100 . " the straight edge movement in punk which was about no drugs , no alcohol , was clean yet very intense and political . it 's a way for them to rebel against their families in some extreme ways yet still be ritualistically , ' good @entity44 . ' " " @entity147 " gave voice to many young @entity17 - @entity19 who felt muted by circumstances and created an opening for bands like @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 -- an all - girl punk band out of @entity192 , @entity193 . in the summer of 2007 , five of the taqwacore bands organized a " taqwa - tour " of the northeastern @entity19 . they played in city after city , traveling in a green school bus with @entity200 painted on the front bought by @entity121 for $ 2,000 on @entity202 . this summer , the @entity11 continue to strike a chord with audiences around the country , hitting cities from @entity207 to @entity127 on a multi-city tour . the taqwacore movement has also inspired two upcoming films - a dramatic feature film based on the book and a documentary . many conservative @entity44 may peg young taqwacores as heretic for their suggestive and irreverent lyrics . but the musicians say they are just trying to show both cultures how broad the spectrum of belief can be . like many young adults balancing their religious beliefs with @entity19 culture , some young @entity44 in the @entity19 say it 's a constant struggle to be accepted in both worlds . " i had a lot of conflicted feelings growing up a @entity17 in @entity51 , " said 25 - year - old @entity11 drummer @entity226 . " it was hard not being able to do the same things that everyone else around you is doing without feeling guilty about them . " @entity121 , who grew up with a @entity235 mother and white supremacist father , converted to @entity112 when he was 16 . he said his message is not one of blasphemy but rather an extension of his discontent with the rigid etiquette that dictates certain practices within @entity112 and the stereotypes of @entity44 in @entity19 . " muslims have n't been fully accepted as @entity19 but the @entity19 experience has n't been accepted as something that can contribute to the @entity17 world , " said @entity121 . @entity121 said writing the book helped him and others connect through shared experiences . " when i first wrote it , i felt like there would never be a place for me in the @entity81 and that has really turned around a lot , " he said . " the book gave me the community i needed , it connected me to all these kids that were also confused and who also went through the things that i went through . " that connection is vital to taqwacore music , bassist @entity10 said . " the music is great , but the conversation is the key to all of this . the dialogue that we have inspired is really invaluable . " " i do n't think @entity112 is ever going to go away , i 'm just trying to see how it best fits in my life .

the @placeholder issues a global travel alert on possible @entity9 attacks	@entity200	hours before 22 @entity1 embassies and consulates were to close for a day , top @entity1 security officials reviewed the situation that led to the unprecedented move . a @entity1 global travel alert remained in place amid fears that @entity9 may launch attacks in the @entity11 , @entity12 and beyond in coming weeks . the threat prompted the @entity1 to announce that 22 facilities would be closed on sunday , including in @entity15 , which was a focus of concern . a saturday afternoon meeting included the @entity20 chief of staff , secretary of state @entity21 , secretary of defense @entity22 , as well as the heads of @entity25 , the @entity26 , the @entity27 and @entity28 and the @entity29 . president @entity30 was briefed after the meeting , according to the @entity20 . on saturday , the security around the @entity1 embassy in @entity15 was even tighter than last year when the embassy was raided by protesters . at least 12 tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building . hundreds of additional security forces were deployed , and roads leading to the embassy were closed . checkpoints were set up at a distance from the embassy , and trucks were n't allowed to pass anywhere near the main embassy road . @entity15 's special forces , the most elite , were seen in small numbers near the embassy , as well . meanwhile , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 have said they , too , will close their embassies in the @entity15 capital , @entity56 , on sunday and monday for security reasons . no other embassies are affected , they said . neither @entity60 nor @entity61 -- which has no embassy in @entity15 -- planned to close any of their embassies . the @entity1 embassies closed on sunday -- a day they would normally be open -- stretch across a swath of @entity12 and the @entity11 , from @entity68 to @entity69 . @entity70 and @entity71 , both majority @entity73 nations , also are affected . the @entity1 government 's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in @entity15 and elsewhere in the @entity11 and @entity12 , said @entity1 officials who spoke to @entity81 on condition of not being identified . official : @entity84 tightened in @entity15 " the threat appears to be much worse than it has ( been ) in a long time , " said a senior national security official in @entity15 , where the government is " on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come . " various @entity93 targets -- not just those tied to the @entity1 -- are under threat , two @entity1 officials said . three sources said the @entity1 has information that members of @entity98 are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack . one of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the @entity73 holy month of @entity106 . sunday is @entity107 , or the @entity108 , one of the holiest moments on the @entity73 calendar . said one @entity1 official : " it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future . " what 's behind timing of terror threat @entity119 , a former @entity1 ambassador to @entity120 , told @entity81 he had never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area . " there have been incidents where they 've closed down a number of embassies in the @entity11 because the information is not specific enough to say that ' embassy x ' got to be closed as opposed to other embassies , " said @entity119 , who joined the @entity123 in 1977 . " but i think this , closing all of these embassies in the @entity11 to @entity12 , is in fact unprecedented . at least , i did n't see this during my career . " ' leave @entity15 now ' @entity1 officials said that , based on intelligence , they were particularly concerned about the @entity137 in @entity15 between saturday and tuesday . president @entity30 , amid regular updates on the situation , has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect @entity1 . a @entity20 official said the president was updated saturday morning by @entity144 , his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism . @entity30 , who departed for @entity148 to play golf , is being updated through the weekend , the official said . he praised @entity15 president @entity150 for his country 's efforts following a meeting thursday at the @entity20 . the @entity50 @entity154 has also warned its citizens against travel to @entity15 , and urged @entity50 nationals to leave as soon as possible . " if you do n't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the @entity50 government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance , " it said . photos : attacks on @entity1 diplomatic sites it was unclear whether the apparent plot targets that @entity169 nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly , and why embassies from @entity70 to @entity172 are being closed . nor is the expected time of an attack known , which explains why the @entity1 travel alert extends through august . " terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests , " the alert states . " @entity1 citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure . " @entity189 rep. @entity188 , a member of the @entity190 , called the information " the most specific i 've seen . " while the principal attention is on the @entity169 , he stressed to @entity81 's @entity193 that " we ca n't rule anything out . " " we are focused on the @entity11 , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace , " @entity188 said . 22 embassies , consulates ordered closed the @entity200 listed the 22 embassies and consulates that are closed sunday , which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected . the 17 affected @entity1 embassies are in @entity71 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity70 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity120 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity172 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity213 , @entity214 , the @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity15 . the @entity1 @entity137 in @entity217 will be closed as normal sunday . see the whole list consulates in @entity120 , @entity214 and the @entity215 are also being shut for the day . embassies and consulates in the region typically close or operate with minimal staff on fridays and saturdays . the shutdowns could extend beyond sunday , a senior @entity200 official said . retired gen. @entity226 -- who until earlier this year was head of @entity228 , responsible for a 20 - country area that includes the @entity11 -- said the decision to close the embassies underscores the reality of the threat and the wisdom of @entity1 policymakers . @entity1 embassies have been targeted before in places such as @entity15 , @entity239 and @entity240 , he pointed out . moreover , @entity98 is one of the terrorist network 's most active and most destructive branches . " we have to remember that we 're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women , children , diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets , " @entity226 told @entity81 on friday . referring to the move by @entity1 officials , he said , " they are showing some proactive discretion here , making certain that we do n't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them . " meanwhile , @entity260 shuttered for one day its diplomatic mission in @entity70 on saturday . questions , concerns after @entity264 @entity20 leaders have been briefed , @entity266 leader @entity265 told reporters , adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided " some understanding of the seriousness of the threat . " @entity188 , who has also heard such briefings , applauded the government 's decision to close its diplomatic missions . " i give them credit , " the @entity278 said of the @entity30 administration . " i think the government is doing exactly the right thing here . " such bipartisan agreement in @entity285 comes at a time when politicians are still scrutinizing the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity1 consular compound in @entity264 , @entity172 , which killed four @entity1 , including ambassador @entity290 . since then , @entity278 have been pressing @entity30 's administration for answers , with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in @entity264 and not doing enough to track down the attackers . eight @entity278 lawmakers are asking that incoming fbi director @entity298 brief @entity297 within 30 days about the investigation . they say the administration 's inquiry to date has been " simply unacceptable , " according to a draft letter obtained by @entity81 . earlier this week , vice president @entity303 and senior @entity200 officials went to @entity297 to discuss embassy security . @entity303 also briefed congressional leadership , key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns , a source who attended the meeting said . another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the @entity264 attack , which created a political firestorm for the administration . on thursday , @entity200 spokeswoman @entity318 said the agency was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution . @entity81 found embassy attack suspect before @entity27	@entity22:Chuck Hagel	@entity20:House	@entity21:John Kerry	@entity26:National Security Agency	@entity27:FBI	@entity25:Homeland Security	@entity144:Lisa Monaco	@entity28:CIA	@entity29:Joint Chiefs of Staff	@entity15:Yemen	@entity98:al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula	@entity81:CNN	@entity84:Security	@entity278:GOP	@entity93:Western	@entity137:Embassy	@entity150:Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi	@entity119:Hill	@entity154:Foreign Office	@entity214:Saudi Arabia	@entity215:United Arab Emirates	@entity1:U.S.	@entity172:Libya	@entity210:Egypt	@entity211:Jordan	@entity212:Kuwait	@entity213:Qatar	@entity318:Marie Harf	@entity9:al Qaeda	@entity239:Turkey	@entity193:Wolf Blitzer	@entity190:House Intelligence Committee	@entity52:Germany	@entity51:France	@entity50:British	@entity298:James Comey	@entity56:Sanaa	@entity297:Congress	@entity290:Christopher Stevens	@entity70:Bangladesh	@entity73:Muslim	@entity30:Obama	@entity107:Laylet al-Qadr	@entity108:Night of Power	@entity12:North Africa	@entity11:Middle East	@entity189:New York	@entity69:Oman	@entity216:Sudan	@entity209:Djibouti	@entity217:Israel	@entity106:Ramadan	@entity240:Tanzania	@entity265:Nancy Pelosi	@entity264:Benghazi	@entity200:State Department	@entity207:Algeria	@entity260:Canada	@entity120:Iraq	@entity188:King	@entity303:Biden	@entity226:Mattis	@entity71:Afghanistan	@entity169:Arabian Peninsula	@entity148:Joint Base Andrews	@entity68:Mauritania	@entity266:Democratic	@entity208:Bahrain	@entity285:Washington	@entity228:U.S. Central Command	@entity61:Spain	@entity60:Italy	@entity123:U.S. Foreign Service
@placeholder was also convicted last week of lying to prosecutors	@entity13	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- former @entity1 president @entity3 was convicted friday on corruption and money laundering charges , and was sentenced to life in prison , according to officials at @entity9 . former @entity1 president @entity3 walks inside the @entity10 in @entity11 on friday . he was fined 200 million new @entity1 dollars ( @entity12 $ 6.1 million ) as well . @entity3 's wife , @entity13 , who earlier had been convicted of lying to prosecutors , also was convicted on similar charges . she received a life sentence and was fined 300 million new @entity1 dollars ( @entity12 $ 9.1 million ) , according to the @entity17 , @entity1 's official news agency . the former president was not at the courthouse when the verdict was read . he had asked to be excused and was being held at a detention center . supporters of @entity3 gathered outside the courthouse hours before the verdict , wearing bright - green shirts , and carrying yellow balloons and banners . riot police stood by in case the crowd got out of control as they protested the verdict . the former president 's corruption trial began in march . it is the first for a former head of state , and has gripped the island for months . he has denied wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated . prosecutors say @entity3 embezzled 600 million new @entity1 dollars ( u.s. $ 17.7 million ) , took bribes , laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president 's office . @entity3 has countered that the bribe money was actually political donations . he has also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and can not be used for . ahead of friday 's verdict , the island 's former first lady was sentenced to a year in prison for lying in her husband 's corruption case . @entity13 was convicted on charges that she helped her son , daughter and son - in - law provide false testimony . prosecutors said the former first couple 's son has a @entity66 bank account with $ 22 million they think are illegal proceeds . the challenge for prosecutors was to prove that @entity3 handed out political favors in exchange for money . the former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor . @entity3 's party favors independence for @entity1 . his successor , president @entity77 , favors closer ties with mainland @entity79 . journalist @entity3 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Chen	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Taiwan	@entity0:TAIPEI	@entity13:Wu Shu-chen	@entity12:U.S.	@entity11:Tucheng	@entity10:Taipei Detention Centre	@entity9:Taipei City Court	@entity17:Central News Agency	@entity79:China	@entity66:Swiss	@entity77:Ma Ying-jeou
but @placeholder prospered in the @entity10 , taking 10 of 12 points	@entity28	( @entity3 ) @entity5 's @entity4 and @entity7 's @entity6 were the latest managers to criticize the heavy @entity10 schedule during the festive period but while the duo lamented their teams playing four games in 13 days , fans in @entity1 and around the world continue to enjoy the action on offer . the @entity10 is , after all , the only major football league not to shut down over the holidays . some supporters had more reason to cheer than others , and on that note , here 's a look at the winners and losers in the @entity10 during its busiest time of the season . winners @entity28 : one of the standout results over the @entity31 period had to be defending champion @entity28 slumping to a 2 - 2 draw with @entity34 -- at home and after holding a 2 - 0 second - half lead . but that was the lone blemish for @entity39 's men , despite nearly squandering another two - goal advantage at home to @entity7 on @entity42 . @entity28 collected 10 of 12 points , scoring 11 goals in the process without talismanic striker @entity46 . @entity28 was also without the services of the perhaps equally influential @entity48 in the heart of the defense . once eight points behind @entity52 , @entity28 and the @entity53 are now level atop the table . @entity55 : @entity56 proved to be a hurricane that stormed past @entity52 on thursday . he scored twice , assisted on another and won a penalty in the stunning 5 - 3 victory over a team that had previously had @entity55 's number . with fellow strikers @entity64 and @entity66 continuing to misfire , his emergence has come at the right time for @entity55 . @entity56 , @entity68 and @entity69 make for an impressive attacking trio . @entity55 -- like @entity28 -- earned three wins and a draw to climb to fifth , only two points behind @entity74 in the race for the final @entity77 spot in @entity1 . @entity74 : a freefall down the table , some would have said , was inevitable for the @entity74 after they lost five straight games heading into the @entity31 rush . yet @entity74 turned it around in a hurry , gathering 10 points . it beat the struggling duo of @entity87 and @entity88 prior to drawing @entity52 and downing @entity89 . sure the referee might have helped @entity74 against @entity52 -- not awarding a seemingly clear penalty to the visitor -- but @entity74 bossed proceedings against @entity89 . for all the talk this season of striker @entity95 and midfielder @entity96 , do n't forget the work of fullbacks @entity99 and @entity101 . @entity102 : winless in 10 games , @entity102 manager @entity103 was hoping for respite on @entity106 against @entity7 . when @entity108 scored for the @entity7 in the first minute , though , it seemed like more bad luck was on the way for @entity102 . @entity102 , however , rallied for a 3 - 1 win and better form followed . after somehow losing to @entity113 1 - 0 -- hitting the post twice and firing 19 shots -- the @entity116 eased past @entity87 2 - 0 to rise to 15th . @entity34 : how could a team that amassed a mere two points in four games be a ' winner , ' you ask ? well , @entity34 , seemingly doomed for relegation in october , showed plenty of grit even with a thin squad -- manager @entity126 named the same starting @entity127 in all four games . the lack of rotation cost @entity126 on thursday , since he had to make three injury enforced subs within 40 minutes , but @entity34 still rallied three times to draw @entity134 away 3 - 3 . as if coming back against @entity28 was n't enough . the two losses were narrow defeats to @entity55 and @entity137 . if @entity138 is a sentimental favorite in @entity140 , @entity141 -- now a point off safety -- is the @entity10 equivalent . losers @entity87 : the honeymoon period is over for @entity147 . adored by the @entity87 fans last season -- enjoying success with a more attractive style than @entity152 ' methodical approach -- @entity147 's team lost all four games . it scored in only one of them . lingering near a @entity77 place early in the season , @entity87 now finds itself a mere four points above the relegation zone . @entity162 : @entity152 ' former assistant at @entity87 , @entity164 , did n't last long in his first stint as manager , getting fired after the sagging @entity162 lost 2 - 0 to @entity167 . but here 's good news for the @entity162 faithful : @entity171 is on the way . @entity171 has never been relegated as a manager and is the reigning manager of the season in the @entity10 , working wonders at @entity88 before leaving the @entity88 on the eve of the current campaign . @entity88 : @entity164 was n't the first manager to go in the @entity10 this season . that ' honor ' went to @entity181 at @entity88 following a 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity74 on @entity106 . @entity181 's second stint in charge at @entity185 started well enough but the team has won once since late september . @entity181 said publicly that @entity88 needed strikers and it 's not difficult to see why with a return of 20 goals . in the last seven , @entity88 has netted twice . former @entity88 midfielder @entity190 is set to take over from @entity181 . @entity191 : when @entity191 won three of its four first league games this season , relegation troubles appeared to be an afterthought . and despite @entity191 still being five points above the bottom three , it 's hard to imagine its fans content . @entity88 's dearth in front of goal is nothing compared to @entity191 , which has scored 11 times in 20 games . in three draws and a loss in the past fortnight , the @entity207 - based club found the back of the net once . @entity52 : the festive period began perfectly for @entity52 . playing at one of the toughest grounds in @entity1 , the @entity213 beat @entity167 2 - 0 . then came another 2 - 0 win , against a then in - form @entity217 . @entity52 looked unstoppable . but slip - ups ensued at @entity74 and @entity55 , with @entity52 manager @entity220 not happy with the referee on both occasions . a @entity220 team has always won the league when it has led at the @entity225 , but @entity52 's dip has given @entity28 hope .	@entity140:La Liga	@entity99:Ryan Bertrand	@entity28:Manchester City	@entity116:Tigers	@entity113:Leicester	@entity138:Eibar	@entity87:Everton	@entity88:Crystal Palace	@entity89:Arsenal	@entity137:Liverpool	@entity68:Nacer Chadli	@entity3:CNN	@entity1:England	@entity217:West Ham	@entity7:Black Cats	@entity6:Gus Poyet	@entity5:Manchester United	@entity4:Louis van Gaal	@entity46:Sergio Aguero	@entity191:Villa	@entity190:Alan Pardew	@entity53:Londoners	@entity52:Chelsea	@entity56:Harry Kane	@entity55:Tottenham	@entity74:Southampton	@entity77:Champions League	@entity31:Christmas	@entity171:Pulis	@entity34:Burnley	@entity10:Premier League	@entity39:Manuel Pellegrini	@entity101:Nathaniel Clyne	@entity102:Hull	@entity103:Steve Bruce	@entity106:Boxing Day	@entity152:Moyes	@entity126:Dyche	@entity96:Dusan Tadic	@entity95:Graziano Pelle	@entity207:Birmingham	@entity141:Burnely	@entity108:Adam Johnson	@entity220:Mourinho	@entity147:Martinez	@entity225:end of a year	@entity167:Stoke	@entity164:Irvine	@entity181:Warnock	@entity213:Blues	@entity134:Newcastle	@entity185:Selhurst Park	@entity162:West Bromwich Albion	@entity42:New Year 's Day	@entity69:Christian Eriksen	@entity66:Emmanuel Adebayor	@entity64:Roberto Soldado	@entity48:Vincent Kompany	@entity127:XI
@entity39 and @placeholder all make the cut . what do they have that other brands do n't ?	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- why does @entity2 dressmaker @entity3 always seem chic ? what does @entity5 seamstress @entity4 have that others do n't ? and even though it 's been 25 years since " @entity10 " , why does everybody still want a pair of @entity12 ? the short answer is , they 're just really cool . it might be a subjective concept -- one man 's cool @entity18 party shirt is another 's discarded @entity21 gift -- but certain brands do seem to stay in fashion forever . it 's a phenomenon highlighted by the @entity5 's annual top 20 " @entity27 " list released today . @entity10 of the pile is @entity29 , @entity31 's car - maker of choice , followed by @entity33 and motorbike designer @entity34 . but numerous fashion labels make it onto the list , with @entity39 highest among them at number four , followed by @entity41 , @entity5 designer @entity42 and perennially cool @entity12 sunglasses . why denim never fades from fashion so , how did these brands manage to acquire this ineffable quality -- at least in the eyes of the @entity49 ? we ask chief executive of the @entity52 and " @entity54 " council chairman @entity53 for his six rules of cool . 1 . style is everything from the door handles to the website and the tags on the clothes to marketing events : if people are to be persuaded a brand is the height of cool , the devil is in the detail , says @entity53 . " it 's not just about making your clothes look good , " he insists . " absolutely everything associated with the brand has to exude style -- from the packaging to the company website , to the type - face on the inside label . " 2 . never try too hard no one likes a busybody and , says @entity53 , even the word " cool " suggests a certain relaxed approach . " the original idea of being cool is being laid back , not running around like a headless chicken trying desperately hard to please everyone . " this , he says , is true for people and fashion brands alike . so , if it feels like a brand is trying way too hard to impress -- chasing every trend going , for example -- then it probably wo n't . celebrity fashion labels : the good , the bad and the ugly 3 . stay true to the brand it 's not cool to fake it . in other words , if a company began life selling pretty knitwear , it should think very carefully before venturing into , say , leather jackets . " you must always remain true to your roots , " instructs @entity53 . " shoppers want something authentic and it 's obvious when you 're out of your comfort zone . " designer @entity42 may have recently passed away , he adds , but it does n't mean that his eponymous label should be tempted to change its style . " as long as it ( the label ) sticks to his original vision it will probably stay on the list . " 4 ) keep evolving this might sound at odds with the previous rule but , according to @entity53 , it 's certainly not . " one of the reasons we keep seeing the same brands on the list , like @entity41 and @entity39 , is because they 're always innovative , but at the same time they retain their core identity . " 5 ) do n't be promiscuous some fashion houses squander their hard fought cool rep by plastering a company logo on everything that moves . in @entity53 ' view , bootmaker @entity138 have been guilty in recent years of such profligacy . " they were known for making really sturdy , simple and good quality footwear . now they 've plastered their name on everything , it 's cheapened the brand and undermined their core product . " 6 ) be humble a stark word of warning for self - satisfied designers everywhere . " successful brands do n't fixate over being cool , instead they just do their own their own thing , stick to their founding principles and follow what they think is right , " says @entity53 . in other words , if you think you 're cool , you probably wo n't be for much longer .	@entity21:Christmas	@entity27:Cool Brands	@entity29:Aston Martin	@entity138:Dr. Martens	@entity12:Ray Ban	@entity3:Chanel	@entity2:French	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:British	@entity4:Vivienne Westwood	@entity53:Cheliotis	@entity52:Centre for Brand Analysis	@entity54:CoolBrand	@entity31:James Bond	@entity33:Apple	@entity34:Harley Davidson	@entity10:Top	@entity39:Rolex	@entity18:Hawaiian	@entity162:Top " Cool Brands	@entity41:Nike	@entity42:Alexander McQueen	@entity49:Brits
@entity8 said he will first try to get agreement on @placeholder as prime minister	@entity82	( @entity0 ) -- it has been nearly four weeks since @entity2 went to the polls and the country is still drifting rudderless without a functioning government . this week , political leaders are holding two days of crucial talks with @entity2 's ceremonial president of the republic , @entity8 . the talks began wednesday morning and are expected to conclude at 6 p.m. thursday in @entity11 . @entity2 's february elections were inconclusive , and have created a political gridlock that is hobbling the country 's economy . the nation is currently in its longest recession in 20 years . it 's economy -- @entity20 's third - largest with a government debt the @entity22 puts at $ 2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 , @entity19 says . after the elections failed to produce a government , international ratings agency @entity24 downgraded @entity2 's credit rating from a- to @entity29 + and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled by a lack of a functioning government . @entity2 's hung parliament met for the first time on friday , when ministers began the process of electing leaders of the lower house and the @entity42 . @entity43 , 51 , a former journalist and spokeswoman for the @entity45 of the high commissioner for refugees , won a strong majority as the speaker of the lower house . @entity50 , 68 , an anti-mafia magistrate from @entity51 , became the speaker of the @entity42 . at a news conference tuesday , @entity43 and @entity50 pledged to push through legislation that would cut salaries and benefits for members of parliament by 30 % . @entity2 lawmakers are among the highest paid in all of @entity20 , according to a @entity19 poll in 2011 . " we are asking for the same kinds of sacrifices to our pay that @entity2 are suffering through the recession , " @entity43 told @entity0 by telephone . but @entity2 is still lacking a functioning prime minister . none of the country 's top leading parties currently has enough support to lead the country single - handedly , and none of the leaders have so far showed a willingness to form a grand coalition or support each other 's candidates for the prime ministerial role . @entity8 said at a news conference tuesday afternoon that during this week 's talks he will first attempt to persuade leaders to support @entity82 of the center - left @entity83 as prime minister . @entity82 fared the best in the february elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament . but he was unable to win a majority in the @entity42 , where it counts . instead , power in the @entity42 was divided between @entity82 and former prime minister @entity96 's center - right coalition , anchored by his party , @entity97 , or @entity97 . @entity82 and @entity96 are arch - rivals who have indicated they will not work together . @entity82 's platform included judicial reforms that reverse legislation passed when @entity96 held office , including expanding statutes of limitations on financial crimes and stripping political leaders of immunity . @entity96 is currently awaiting a verdict in a trial in which he stands accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex on more than 13 occasions and abusing his office to protect her in an unrelated crime . the verdict is expected to come in early april . last year , @entity96 was convicted of tax fraud . last month , he was convicted of publishing illegally acquired wiretaps in his brother 's newspaper . he is appealing both convictions . @entity96 has indicated that he does not agree with @entity82 's judicial and criminal reforms and that he would not work with the center - left as long as those items are on the agenda . the election deadlock has meant that @entity127 , a former comedian and political revolutionary who led his grass - roots @entity130 to third - place in the elections by promising to get rid of @entity2 's tired politicians and traditional political parties , would be the key to power if he were to support one of the traditional parties . but since the elections , he has refused to work with either @entity82 or @entity96 , resulting in the political gridlock . he has said no to a political or technocratic government , leaving little room to negotiate . @entity127 , continuing to rebuff @entity82 's attempts to work together to form a coalition , friday called @entity82 " dead man talking . " but his own party is showing some fractures . a dozen of its members in parliament voted against the party 's candidates in the elections last weekend to choose the parliamentary leaders . @entity127 , who is not a member of parliament and did not run for office , lambasted his unfaithful party members on his personal blog . @entity160 , who led @entity2 in a technocratic role after @entity96 resigned under pressure in november 2011 , did not win enough support in the february elections to bolster either side , and his austerity platform is not seen as a draw for support . he has been acting as prime minister since the election produced no winner , but he threatened to walk off the job last weekend during the debate over electing the parliamentary leaders . saturday , @entity8 asked @entity160 to stay on in his caretaker role until a government can be formed . " it is important for @entity20 , and to exercise whatever initiatives are possible and necessary , especially for the economy and jobs , the government remains under the authoritative leadership of @entity160 until a new government is formed , " @entity8 said in a written statement . @entity8 's intervention meetings on wednesday and thursday will either confirm @entity82 as a prime minister or produce a technocratic leader who will guide the country forward to inevitable early elections , likely either in june or next autumn . to further complicate matters , @entity8 's mandate as president ends on may 15 . in accordance with @entity2 's electoral law , the president can not dissolve parliament or call new elections with less than six months left in office . that means that either with or without a prime minister , @entity2 's hung parliament must begin the process of electing a new president to replace @entity8 . that process will start on april 15 with the nomination of candidates , a step subject to a fair amount of backroom horse - trading . @entity96 recently said in an interview on his @entity212 television network that he would consider agreeing to @entity82 as prime minister if his center - right ally , @entity214 , were elected president of the @entity216 . other presidential candidate names mentioned by members of parliament in interviews with the @entity2 press include @entity160 and respected @entity224 leader and former @entity225 member of parliament @entity226 .	@entity22:Treasury Ministry	@entity20:Europe	@entity24:Fitch	@entity29:BBB	@entity82:Bersani	@entity83:Partito Democratico	@entity127:Grillo	@entity130:Five-Star Movement	@entity214:Gianni Letta	@entity2:Italian	@entity216:Republic	@entity0:CNN	@entity212:Mediaset	@entity8:Napolitano	@entity51:Sicily	@entity50:Grasso	@entity11:Rome	@entity19:Eurobarometer	@entity97:People of Freedom	@entity96:Silvio Berlusconi	@entity160:Monti	@entity225:European Union	@entity224:Radical Party	@entity226:Emma Bonino	@entity45:U.N.

@placeholder 's @entity2 beat @entity103 side @entity6 4 - 2 in first leg of @entity9 quarterfinal	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- a glorious attacking display by @entity2 earned the @entity4 side a 4 - 2 win at @entity6 in the first leg of the @entity9 quarterfinals at the @entity10 on thursday . @entity11 put @entity2 ahead in the 20th minute poking the ball home after a @entity6 goalkeeper @entity14 mishandled the ball . but the lead did n't last long with @entity4 's @entity17 latching onto a cross from @entity20 defender @entity19 to level the scores two minutes later . the veteran striker was on hand to score @entity6 's second of the night and the goal of the match in the 60th minute as he smashed home a sensational 20 - yard volley . a free - flowing game eventually yielded a fourth goal in the 73rd minute as @entity11 headed home his second of the night with @entity31 firing @entity2 ahead with nine minutes remaining . an injury - time counterattack earned the away side a fourth when @entity34 unselfishly squared the ball to @entity36 who swept the ball past a helpless @entity38 -- who replaced the injured @entity14 at halftime . it was also a good night for @entity41 as they beat @entity43 2 - 1 at the @entity44 . @entity46 striker @entity45 headed home from @entity49 's free - kick to give the home side an early ninth minute lead before @entity52 put the @entity54 side back on level terms seven minutes before the break sliding in to meet a @entity58 cross . @entity45 was involved in the winner , nodding down into the path of substitute @entity61 who then curled a shot past goalkeeper @entity64 . @entity4 's third representative in the quarterfinals , @entity65 did n't fare so well , going down 2 - 1 away to @entity69 side @entity68 . @entity71 striker @entity70 put the home side ahead on the stroke of halftime with a deft side - foot volley from a corner kick . @entity65 grabbed what could be a vital away goal six minutes after the break when @entity81 international @entity80 heading home from close range . but it was @entity68 's night as @entity85 slotted home neatly after receiving a cutback from @entity70 . second half goals from @entity88 ( 51st minute ) and a 64th minute free kick from @entity90 earned @entity91 a 2 - 1 win over @entity93 . the @entity95 side grabbed an away goal in injury time when @entity98 scored from the penalty spot . all four second legs will be played on thursday april 5 .	@entity17:Raul	@entity20:Japan	@entity80:Mehmet Topal	@entity81:Turkish	@entity85:Maarten Martens	@entity88:Marat Izmailov	@entity2:Athletic Bilbao	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Schalke	@entity4:Spain	@entity9:Europa League	@entity10:Veltins Arena	@entity52:Mame Diouf	@entity54:German	@entity58:Lars Stindl	@entity71:Australian	@entity70:Brett Holman	@entity31:De Marcos	@entity14:Hildebrand	@entity34:Markel Susaeta	@entity11:Llorente	@entity36:Iker Muniain	@entity38:Mathias Schober	@entity43:Hannover	@entity19:Atsuto Uchida	@entity103:Bundesliga	@entity98:Cleiton Xavier	@entity95:Ukraine	@entity93:Metalist Kharkiv	@entity91:Sporting Lisbon	@entity90:Emiliano Insua	@entity44:Estadio Vicente Calderon	@entity45:Falcao	@entity46:Colombian	@entity41:Atletico Madrid	@entity68:AZ Alkmaar	@entity69:Dutch	@entity64:Ron-Robert Zieler	@entity65:Valencia	@entity49:Gabi	@entity61:Eduardo Salvio
@entity24 , @entity25 accused of transferring money to @placeholder	@entity10	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a leading @entity4 - @entity3 group lashed out at the federal government friday for moving to seize assets -- including four mosques -- that belong to a foundation and a corporation believed linked to @entity10 . " @entity4 and faith communities must not allow houses of worship to become pawns in geopolitical struggles , " said @entity11 , executive director of the @entity13 's @entity12 . " the tension between the @entity3 and @entity10 must not be played out in the mosques of @entity3 . " federal prosecutors say their actions against assets belonging to the @entity24 and the @entity25 , which also include a @entity27 skyscraper , are not an effort to target mosques . " there are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants , " said @entity30 , a spokesman for the @entity31 for the @entity32 in a written statement thursday . " the tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today 's filing . " a senior @entity44 official told reporters that the government is moving against the @entity10 landlords of the buildings , not seizing mosques as religious - oriented facilities . the mosques -- in @entity0 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question , the official said . but the @entity13 's @entity12 called the actions an " unprecedented encroachment of religious freedom . " the group said " it is an abiding concern among the @entity64 that this action is just the beginning of a backlash after last week 's @entity68 shooting tragedy . " a @entity4 - @entity3 soldier is accused in a @entity68 , @entity54 , shooting spree that left 13 people dead and dozens injured . the @entity74 , another leading @entity4 - @entity3 group , issued a statement thursday saying the government 's actions may have @entity79 implications . " whatever the details of the government 's case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of @entity3 houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to @entity97 worldwide , " said @entity80 , the national communications director for the council . the controversy erupted after prosecutors in @entity0 filed an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of all assets of the @entity24 and @entity25 they include properties owned by the foundation in several states . a 36 - story office tower in midtown @entity27 is owned by the 650 @entity107 , a partnership between @entity109 and @entity110 , the @entity44 said . the complaint alleges that the @entity24 provided services to the @entity10 government and transferred money from 650 @entity107 to @entity115 , @entity10 's largest state - owned financial entity . @entity3 and @entity117 officials last year designated @entity115 as a proliferator for supporting @entity10 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the @entity122 and @entity123 , considered terrorist groups by the @entity3 . @entity115 issued a statement last year denying involvement in deceptive banking practices . prosecutors allege the properties at issue were " involved in and [ were ] the proceeds of money laundering offenses , " and that the owners violated the @entity134 , executive orders and @entity3 @entity137 regulations . " as today 's complaint alleges in great detail , the @entity24 has effectively been a front for the government of @entity10 , " @entity138 , @entity3 attorney for the @entity32 , said on thursday . " for two decades , the @entity24 's affairs have been directed by various @entity10 officials , including @entity10 ambassadors to the @entity146 , in violation of a series of @entity3 laws . the @entity24 's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice , and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing . " @entity155 , a @entity0 lawyer representing the @entity24 , said his client would challenge the complaint .

@placeholder @entity1 is expected to rule shortly on @entity4 's sweeping health care reform	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity2 @entity1 upheld president @entity4 's sweeping health care legislation thursday in a narrow 5 - 4 ruling that @entity4 says will provide up to 30 million additional @entity2 with health care . @entity2 does n't have universal health care coverage -- what the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) calls " a widely shared political aim of most countries " -- but neither do most other countries . nearly 50 countries have attained universal or near - universal health coverage by 2008 , according to the @entity15 . several well - known examples exist like the @entity17 , which has the @entity18 , and the @entity20 public health care system . here are more examples of countries have implemented near - universal health care . @entity24 free health care coverage is recognized as a citizen 's right in @entity24 . @entity24 have both a private and public health care system , which was overhauled in 1988 . the @entity29 , a nationalized program , provides primary health care , while a network of public and contracted hospitals delivers specialist care . about 80 percent of @entity24 's population relies on public care , while the wealthiest 20 % can afford private health care , according to a @entity39 report . since the 1990s , @entity24 has also provided universal access to hiv / aids drugs . during the three decades since the nation 's major health care changes , infant mortality decreased and life expectancy increased by 10.6 years , according to a 2011 article in medical journal @entity48 . but the system has n't been without problems , according to the @entity39 report , which alluded to gaps in the quality of care between various @entity24 regions . @entity56 since establishing a national health plan in 1999 , @entity56 has insured about 91 % of its population with health care -- a greater percentage than the @entity2 . @entity56 has been dubbed " @entity65 's @entity64 " by @entity61 for its transformation since a devastating genocide in 1994 . watch @entity66 talk with @entity56 's president the country has three health insurance plans , one for government employees , another for the military , and the third for the remaining population . the country commits about 20 % of its annual spending to health , which is funded by tax revenues , insurance premiums and financial support from international donations , according to a @entity8 report . since introducing health insurance , @entity56 has seen lower childhood mortality rates ; more people are also receiving medical attention . but the country faces challenges from an increase in health services and making contributions more affordable for its poorest citizens , according to a @entity8 report . @entity94 by law , @entity94 requires all patients to be covered by health insurance , regardless of their ability to pay . the @entity8 uses @entity94 as an example of a low - or middle - income country that has been able to extend health coverage to all citizens . introduced in 2002 as the " 30 - bhat scheme , " ( which is less than $ 1 ) , the plan added about 14 million previously uninsured people to the @entity94 system . prescription drugs , hospitalizations and services like chemotherapy , surgery and emergency care are free to patients , according to a @entity8 report . but the addition of millions of people to a health care system strained the existing structures , prompting criticisms of long waits , poor quality of service and shortage of service . @entity125 @entity125 passed a law in 1977 , mandating health insurance for industrial workers . during its rapid economic growth , health care became a priority for the government , which created the @entity133 . the system extended to universal coverage by 1989 . the government merged more than 300 individual insurers into a single national fund , according to a @entity8 report . @entity125 's single - payer program has " been successful in mobilizing resources for health care , rapidly extending population coverage , effectively pooling public and private resources to purchase health care for the entire population , and containing health care expenditure , " according to a report published in @entity149 . but another report published in @entity151 said that the public funding is limited , leaving " beneficiaries with relatively high payments . " @entity125 's expenditure on health care is 6.3 % of the country 's gross domestic product , compared with 18 % in the @entity2 . @entity159 the eastern @entity161 country became independent with the fall of the @entity163 in 1991 . by 2004 , it began a mandatory health insurance program with the aim of providing the entire population with basic health care . employed @entity159 chip in a portion of their income through a payroll tax or a flat - rate contribution . others who are unemployed or not working are insured by the government . its @entity175 is the sole buyer of health care services and organizes emergency , primary and secondary care locally , according to a report by the @entity181 , a joint partnership between @entity161 governments and the @entity8 . @entity184 @entity184 's level of health care is comparable to average @entity161 standards , according to the @entity8 's profile of the @entity190 country . the country began building up its health care system as it gained wealth from oil revenues . by the 1950s , the government implemented free comprehensive health care . this resulted in declines in general mortality and infant deaths , the report said . " free health care was so extensive that it even included veterinary medicine , " according to a local @entity8 report . @entity184 faces an aging population as well as an epidemic of diabetes , heart disease and obesity - related complications that place great demands on its health care system . @entity212 the @entity212 constitution guarantees rights to health protection . @entity212 can opt for public care or get coverage from private health insurance companies . wealthier citizens can buy insurance from the @entity221 or obtain coverage through their employer . a 7 % income tax funds the public health care system , the @entity225 , according to an analysis of health care reform in @entity212 . public care includes free medical , dental and midwifery services , which are run locally . private insurance tends to focus on specialist treatment . the existence of both public - private insurance has created inequities of care , prompting reform efforts in 2000 to increase equality across the country . @entity212 has guaranteed universal access to quality treatment for some conditions including certain cancers , @entity244 , pneumonia , depression and dental care , which has improved care for the poor , according to the @entity8 . @entity249 @entity249 announced an overhaul of its health system in 2009 to bring safe , affordable basic health services to all residents -- a tall order for a country containing 1.3 billion people . the government committed about $ 126 billion to reform the quality and efficiency of its health care , and ensure affordable and quality medication . but the issue of equity in health care persists . " there are still significant disparities in health status between regions , urban and rural areas , and among population groups , " according to the @entity8 . @entity249 has seen increased life expectancy and reductions in infant deaths , but health observers stated in the @entity8 report the need to improve delivery of care .	@entity20:Canadian	@entity24:Brazilian	@entity29:Sistema Ãšnico de SaÃºde	@entity159:Moldovans	@entity125:South Korea	@entity151:Health Affairs	@entity133:National Health Insurance	@entity2:U.S.	@entity1:Supreme Court	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:National Health Insurance Company	@entity212:Chile	@entity4:Obama	@entity8:World Health Organization	@entity190:Middle Eastern	@entity56:Rwanda	@entity17:UK	@entity15:International Labor Organization	@entity39:Center for Strategic and International Studies	@entity18:National Health Service	@entity244:HIV / AIDS	@entity94:Thai	@entity249:China	@entity221:Instituciones de Salud Previsional	@entity163:Soviet Union	@entity161:Europe	@entity225:Fondo Nacional de Salud	@entity181:European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies	@entity184:Kuwait	@entity149:Health Policy Plan	@entity282:non-Western	@entity280:Universal	@entity66:Fareed Zakaria	@entity64:Singapore	@entity65:Africa	@entity48:The Lancet	@entity61:The Economist

" i 'm hoping this will be the last juggalos gathering that they will ever have , " @entity3 said monday in an interview with e-online . her lawyer is preparing to sue the festival , which is organized for fans of the hip - hop group @entity19 . festival organizers did not respond to @entity2 requests for a response . this was the event 's 11th year , the fourth in rural @entity26 , @entity27 . cuts on the @entity30 model and singer 's face required stitches . and her body is covered with bruises , she said . an angry crowd pelted @entity3 with rocks , bottles and human excrement as she performed early saturday , she said .

@placeholder 's killer , @entity4 , wo n't likely find a safe job , his lawyer says	@entity51	( @entity0 ) -- his trial 's over . and now it turns out that @entity4 might need the same thing millions of @entity6 are looking for : a job . as @entity4 and his legal team mounted their defense , they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him . living expenses , bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly , they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case . so what 's next , now that a jury has acquitted him ? for the 29 - year - old @entity24 man , the financial picture is cloudy . critics have already accused @entity4 of profiting from the case . will the donations keep pouring in ? will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against @entity31 ? could he cash in on his personal story with a book or movie deal ? beyond the legal costs , @entity4 's attorney says the case has come at a high price . fear for his safety has made him live off the grid for months . " i do n't know how he gets a job where he is out in public , " @entity4 's lawyer @entity45 said , " without having the fear of somebody finding out where he works . " expert to @entity4 : pick a new career path before he shot 17 - year - old @entity51 in february 2012 , @entity4 had studied criminal justice . he applied to become a police officer in @entity54 in 2009 , but was rejected due to bad credit , according to testimony in his trial . even with more money in his bank account , that career path should n't be on the table anymore , an expert told @entity0 . " that is the absolute worst thing you can do , " said reputation management counselor @entity63 . " it might be your old passion ; you need to find a new passion . and it needs to be helping people in a very different way -- a way that is much more compassionate , not just involving law enforcement . " so far , @entity4 's lawyers and family have been tight - lipped about his next steps . @entity45 describes his client as a marked man , arguing that his options are limited due to death threats he faces . " the first time that he got out of jail , he slept a lot . i think he is going to have to take a lot of time to relax , to center himself , to get used to his new reality , which is a free man , exonerated , " brother @entity86 told @entity0 en @entity88 ol on sunday . " and he is going to have to take his own steps as he sees fit , whatever brings him the best result . " whatever he does , his brother said , it will have to be under the radar . " as he engages the world , as anyone in his situation would , without restrictions , " @entity86 said , " he 's going to have to learn to move about in a very low - profile way and keep to himself . " race perhaps simplest disagreement in @entity4 post-trial interviews donations fueled defense , led to wife 's arrest but online , at least , being low - profile has n't exactly been @entity4 's style . through websites set up for his defense , he raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars . one site , gzdefensefund.com , raised more than $ 330,000 in just over a year , according to a spokesman for @entity4 's lawyer . that 's in addition to about $ 200,000 @entity4 raised on his own through a @entity121 account before @entity45 took the case . where did that money go ? a summary on the website gives examples of how @entity4 spent some of the donations : $ 95,000 for bail bond , about $ 56,000 for security and a whopping $ 61,747.54 for living expenses over an eight - month period . " if $ 61,747.54 sounds like a lot of money for living expenses for 8 months -- you are right , " the website says . " it 's more than most people earn in a year . most of @entity4 's living expenses for the first several months were allocated to providing a safe , secure place for @entity4 and his wife , @entity144 , to live . " at one point after his arrest , the site says , @entity4 was hiding out in a location that was so remote that it cost $ 2,500 to connect a phone line . raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from supporters for your case is a good thing , right ? well , it was n't for @entity156 , who now faces a perjury charge . prosecutors allege she lied when she told a @entity24 judge during a bail hearing for her husband in april 2012 that the family was indigent . in fact , they argue , @entity4 actually had about $ 135,000 at the time . she 's pleaded not guilty , and has a court date in the case scheduled for next month . even if donations keep pouring in , @entity4 should n't necessarily take all the money he 's offered , said @entity169 , a crisis public relations manager . " he 's got to be careful to avoid the appearances of creating more divisions by accepting money or support openly from groups that , maybe , that would create more friction because of the tenor of this case , " he said . " he 's got to be careful about who he associates with afterwards , even if they are offering financial support . " despite outrage , federal charges uncertain in case what about a book ? a juror in the high - profile case has already inked a deal with an agent for a possible book . could a book or a made - for - tv movie be in @entity4 's future ? last week @entity195 's @entity194 said a multimillion - dollar book for @entity4 would probably be in the offing . and that possibility is already drawing sharp criticism . in an editorial titled " @entity4 's acquittal should n't lead to riches , " the @entity200 argued monday that @entity4 is " likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals . " " it would be a shame , " the newspaper said , " if the unnecessary death of 17 - year - old @entity51 produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle . " civil lawsuits surge to the forefront even with the criminal trial over , @entity4 still is likely to face several legal battles . activists are pushing for the federal government to file civil rights charges against him . and it 's possible @entity51 's family will file a civil wrongful death case , which could threaten @entity4 's pocketbook . they have n't said yet if they will . that could be more likely , some analysts say , if it appeared @entity4 was profiting from the case . a book or movie deal could make @entity4 more vulnerable to a wrongful death suit , criminal defense attorney @entity232 told @entity237 . and then there 's another case that @entity4 started , suing @entity240 over edited versions of a 911 call @entity4 made . that lawsuit alleges that @entity31 deliberately edited an audio tape of his 911 call to make @entity4 sound racist . " because of @entity31 's deceptive and exploitative manipulations , the public wrongly believes that @entity4 ' use ( d ) a racial epithet ' while describing @entity51 during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night , " the suit says . @entity240 has disputed the accusations . " there was no intent to portray mr. @entity4 unfairly , " the company said last year . " we intend to vigorously defend our position in court . " the lawsuit says @entity4 is seeking " damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit , " but does n't specify a dollar figure . @entity4 's brother says the family is focusing on getting a fresh start . but so far , the verdict has n't put a stop to debate over the controversial case . and it 's unclear what that could mean for @entity4 's cash flow . @entity0 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 , @entity195 's @entity283 and in @entity285 's @entity284 contributed to this report .	@entity86:Robert Zimmerman	@entity24:Florida	@entity278:David Mattingly	@entity279:MaryLynn Ryan	@entity88:EspaÃ ±	@entity277:Thom Patterson	@entity156:Shellie Zimmerman	@entity232:Randy Reep	@entity0:CNN	@entity237:USA Today	@entity4:Zimmerman	@entity6:Americans	@entity195:HLN	@entity194:Nancy Grace	@entity51:Trayvon Martin	@entity54:Virginia	@entity31:NBC	@entity240:NBC Universal	@entity200:Philadelphia Inquirer	@entity121:PayPal	@entity144:Shellie	@entity169:Gene Grabowski	@entity283:Graham Winch	@entity282:Kate Bolduan	@entity281:Chris Cuomo	@entity280:Gustavo Valdes	@entity285:Session	@entity284:Jessica Thill	@entity45:O'Mara	@entity63:Mike Paul

" as wide as possible cooperation ... should happen at the latest tomorrow evening , " said @entity14 , head of the @entity15 , which placed third . the center - right @entity18 took first place in the vote . its candidate , @entity22 , has three days to cobble together a government . " there should be government of national salvation with as many parties as possible , " @entity22 told reporters . @entity30 's leader , @entity29 , held talks monday that the @entity18 leader described as " constructive . " the party 's platform has supported the bailouts while seeking to renegotiate the terms . with almost all ballots counted , @entity18 had won nearly 30 % of the vote , the @entity37 said . that gives the party 129 seats in the country 's 300 - seat parliament , forcing it to seek other coalition members from the fragmented field to form a majority . @entity48 , the leader of the leftist @entity50 party , which came in second , met with @entity22 but said monday he would not back a coalition . " history and the people will judge them by their results , " @entity48 said of the parties backing the existing bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping @entity0 afloat . " shortly we will be vindicated . " what will @entity0 elections mean for the country 's future ? he said his party 's nearly 27 % showing had forced @entity0 leaders to realize the bailout is " nonviable , " and said @entity50 would press as a member of the opposition for the bailouts to be scrapped . an official with @entity50 told @entity2 that no one from the party was planning to attend the meeting . @entity50 , which campaigned against the terms of the bailout , got 71 seats . @entity9 , which long dominated @entity0 politics , won 33 . four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each . the vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether @entity0 should remain in the euro , the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in @entity88 . the possibility of a " no " vote roiled world markets , with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $ 1 trillion . @entity95 markets reacted positively to the election results , while @entity88 and @entity98 markets were mixed . @entity22 said he would build a government of " parties that believe in the nation 's @entity88 orientation , that believe in the euro . " but he acknowledged that government budget cuts forced on the country by international lenders have caused suffering among @entity0 . a wild election weekend for @entity0 , @entity107 and @entity108 the new government will have to make changes " in order for the @entity0 people to escape the torturous reality of unemployment and unbelievable difficulties that every @entity0 family faces today , " @entity22 said after meeting with the president . he faces a new round of coalition talks , six weeks after a previous election that failed to produce a government . international bailouts have kept @entity0 from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue , but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange . @entity130 finance ministers praised the election results , " which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring @entity0 back on a path of sustainable growth .

oscar winner was arrested en route to @placeholder , which was honoring him	@entity40	( @entity0 ) -- @entity4 - winning filmmaker @entity3 has been arrested in @entity2 on a decades - old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in @entity7 , @entity2 police said sunday . @entity3 attends a film premiere in @entity9 , @entity10 , in june 2009 . @entity3 , 76 , was taken into custody trying to enter @entity2 on saturday , @entity12 police said . a spokesman for the @entity15 said @entity3 was arrested upon arrival at the airport . he has lived in @entity10 for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the @entity18 and declined to appear in person to collect his @entity20 for " @entity21 " in 2003 . the director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13 - year - old girl . but he fled the @entity18 before he could be sentenced , and @entity18 authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978 . watch what happens now for @entity3 » @entity3 was nominated for best director @entity4 for " @entity33 " and " @entity34 , " and for best writing for " @entity36 , " which he also directed . he was en route to the @entity40 , which is holding a @entity3 tribute this year , when he was arrested by @entity2 authorities , the festival said . a provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of @entity44 , @entity7 , after authorities learned @entity3 was going to be in @entity2 , @entity46 , spokeswoman for the @entity50 district attorney 's office , told @entity0 on sunday . there have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been @entity3 's refusal to return to attend hearings . prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child . " the @entity15 said @entity3 was put " in provisional detention . " but whether he can be extradited to the @entity18 " can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , " a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail . " it is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , " the spokesman wrote . " their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . " @entity46 said the extradition process will be determined in @entity2 , but said authorities are ready to move forward with @entity3 's sentencing process , depending on what happens in @entity12 . @entity3 was accused of plying a 13 - year - old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor @entity91 's house . he was 43 at the time . @entity91 was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress @entity94 , was . according to a probation report contained in the filing , @entity95 described the victim as " sullen . " " she appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . she did not look like a 13 - year - old scared little thing , " @entity95 said . she added that @entity3 did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . " i do n't think he 's a bad man , " she said in the report . " i think he 's an unhappy man . " @entity3 pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor . there have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been @entity3 's refusal to return to attend hearings . prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child . " @entity3 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a @entity44 judge rejected the request . in doing so , @entity129 judge @entity128 left the door open to reconsider his ruling if @entity3 shows up in court . @entity133 also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way @entity3 's case was handled years ago . according to court documents , @entity3 , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare @entity3 from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial . but the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum - security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send @entity3 back to prison for another 48 days . @entity3 fled the @entity18 for @entity10 , where he was born . in the february hearing , @entity133 mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media - obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send @entity3 to prison . " it 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " said @entity133 . but he declined to dismiss the case entirely . legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare . @entity3 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out . @entity171 filed court papers in january saying , " i am no longer a 13 - year - old child . i have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . " every time this case is brought to the attention of the @entity129 , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . that attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . " @entity187 , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued @entity3 and received an undisclosed settlement . she long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . following @entity133 's ruling earlier this year , @entity187 's lawyer , @entity192 , said he was disappointed and that @entity133 " did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption . " he argued in court that had " mr. @entity3 been treated fairly " his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime . @entity3 's arrest saturday came two days after one of his wife 's killers died . the director 's pregnant wife , actress @entity207 , and four others were butchered by members of the @entity211 " family " in august 1969 . @entity3 was filming in @entity212 at the time . by her own admission , @entity213 held the eight - months - pregnant @entity215 down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26 - year - old actress 16 times . @entity0 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .	@entity20:Academy Award for Best Director	@entity21:The Pianist	@entity15:Swiss Justice Ministry	@entity192:Larry Silver	@entity133:Espinoza	@entity12:Zurich	@entity3:Polanski	@entity2:Switzerland	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:California	@entity211:Manson	@entity212:Europe	@entity4:Oscar	@entity9:Paris	@entity10:France	@entity219:Frederik Pleitgen	@entity50:Los Angeles County	@entity171:Samantha Geimer	@entity33:Tess	@entity34:Chinatown	@entity36:Rosemary 's Baby	@entity18:U.S.	@entity128:Peter Espinoza	@entity129:Court	@entity95:Huston	@entity94:Anjelica Huston	@entity207:Sharon Tate	@entity91:Nicholson	@entity221:Karan Olson	@entity220:Brooke Bowman	@entity222:Ann O'Neill	@entity213:Susan Atkins	@entity187:Geimer	@entity44:Los Angeles	@entity215:Tate	@entity46:Gibbons	@entity40:Zurich Film Festival
number of @placeholder people without insurance is disproportionate to the general population	@entity8	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 started shopping for health insurance as soon as the @entity4 insurance marketplaces opened on october 1 . the @entity6 resident is like a lot @entity8 citizens who have not had access to affordable health insurance in the past . if @entity1 , 47 , had been able to legally marry , he would have immediately been eligible for coverage under his partner , @entity15 's , policy . @entity15 has domestic partnership benefits at work , but the couple have n't lived together long enough to qualify for them . " i 'm a diabetic , so i do want to make sure i 'm covered , " @entity1 said . @entity1 says he is n't the only person he knows in @entity22 's @entity8 community shopping for health insurance . many have turned to @entity1 , who used to work in public health , for casual advice . " a lot of what i 've found with these exchanges is confusing , and i 've got a ph.d. -- and experience with insurance , " @entity1 said . " there are many individuals who do n't have a lot of education , and these terms are completely new to them . it 's daunting . " obamacare navigators help patients sign up for health as a whole the @entity8 community has less experience with insurance than the general population . a survey done by the @entity48 found that about a third of respondents were uninsured . it 's estimated some 16.3 % of the general population is uninsured . in honor of @entity54 on friday , @entity55 's " be out . be healthy . get covered " campaign has launched a new @entity8 - friendly website with advice about how to navigate the insurance marketplace . @entity60 , who heads the program , did focus groups and surveys with several hundred @entity8 people and heard serious concerns about the current health care system . " we 've heard from people that health care is fundamental , " @entity60 said . " yet we wanted to make sure we were n't steering the community to something that would n't work for them . we wanted to make sure the policies in place will be inclusive of the community . " while the community is not monolithic , it does struggle with some particular health challenges that become much more deadly if a lack of health insurance keeps them from regular checkups . for instance , studies show lesbians are less likely than other women to get routine screenings that could detect cervical and breast cancer . a woman 's chances of surviving go up significantly if the cancers are caught early . men who have sex with men -- the clinical term for gay men -- account for 63 % of the estimated new hiv infections in 2010 , according to the @entity97 . regular hiv testing could help stop the spread of the virus . in light of this challenge , the @entity102 administration called a meeting of @entity8 leaders in mid-september . nearly 200 from across the country met with the @entity108 to talk about the potential impact of @entity4 . it also looked at what @entity8 leaders could do to spread the word . " the purpose of this briefing was to equip community leaders with the tools , information and resources they need to get involved and help local lgbt communities get access to quality , affordable health care , " @entity114 secretary @entity113 said . @entity4 " is not about politics . it 's about dignity . " @entity128 and healthy needed to make @entity4 mandate @entity130 worked with the administration to make sure the @entity4 law is completely lgbt inclusive . in years past , insurance companies were not required to allow coverage of domestic partners . now marketplaces will offer policies that are inclusive and domestic partnership benefits will be clearly spelled out . the law also prevents insurance companies from turning someone away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity . in @entity55 's focus groups they heard horror stories about companies turning applicants away because they did n't want to cover gay or transgender people . before the @entity4 , people with pre-existing conditions often could n't get coverage . now people with illnesses that involve ongoing treatment like @entity157 or with a chronic illness like @entity1 ' diabetes will be able to get access to health insurance . finally there will be no lifetime caps on coverage , which is particularly important to those who require constant checkups and who take medicine for chronic conditions . @entity4 open enrollment : everything you need to know preventative care like counseling for obesity , drug treatment , smoking cessation programs and mental health are mandatory for insurance companies to cover under @entity4 . all could help the lgbt community . studies show lesbians and bisexual women have a higher rate of stress , smoking and obesity than the general population . they 're also at risk for heart disease , the no. 1 cause of death for women . gay men also have a high rate of stress , smoking and substance abuse , studies show . now with the marketplaces open , lgbt groups across the country are doing their bit to spread the word . many have received grants and special training to help with this process . open enrollment for the @entity4 insurance marketplaces runs through march 31 . but to get covered by january 1 -- the deadline for everyone in the country to have insurance -- you must pay for a policy by december 15 . people with lower incomes will get subsidies or tax breaks to buy them if they shop through the @entity4 marketplaces . in some states they may also qualify for @entity219 , which some chose to expand . @entity220 , director of health policy research at the @entity222 in @entity223 that focuses on @entity8 health , says it will continue to spread the word about the @entity4 marketplaces . " there are barriers that will finally be done away with in january ; it 's a great thing , " @entity220 said . " we really want to take advantage of the @entity4 and get the number of insured up and get our access to care numbers up , or at least on par with what the straight community experiences . there are so many opportunities here . " doctor shortage , increased demand could crash health care unemployed since june , @entity1 is covered by @entity244 insurance , but it comes with a steep price tag of a couple hundred dollars a month . " i 'm starting to realize just how good my policy was through work , " @entity1 said . " i used to only pay $ 26 a month , now next to my mortgage this is the biggest bill i have . " @entity1 says he will continue shopping around for the policy that will work best for him . he said the system crashed a couple of times when he was looking at it , but the navigators he called were nice . they , too , struggled to help , since their computers also kept crashing . @entity1 says he is undeterred . " i 'm pretty optimistic it will work , " @entity1 said . " and i will feel better knowing that i 'm covered .

training facility in @entity20 countryside modeled after @placeholder village	@entity30	editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8 . @entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network . the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process . we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers . @entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity9 ) -- in april this year i embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd @entity23 at their training facility in @entity25 , @entity26 . we went there to film the @entity26 army 's much - talked - about , multimillion pound " replica @entity30 village . " the focus of the piece was to be on the younger members of the battalion . some of them are as young as 18 and only months away from their first visit to @entity40 in september 2010 . the majority of @entity26 casualties are all recorded in that area . i 'd heard about the @entity30 village training facility from an @entity45 turned photographer called @entity47 . a couple of years ago , @entity5 published a photo essay in which he visited the homes of badly injured soldiers returned from @entity53 or @entity30 . perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the @entity26 government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock . @entity47 served his time in the @entity65 on tours of @entity67 in the late 80s to early 90s . but after being discharged he fell on hard times . he became homeless and spent a long time wandering the streets of @entity19 . he slept in cardboard boxes in doorways , often coming across fellow army veterans who faced a similar lack of support and sympathy from society , the government or the army . happily , @entity47 managed to get himself off the streets and , inspired by the stories of his fellow homeless veterans , became a campaigner of sorts for veterans rights , using his photography . his story and those of other ex-paras is now available to watch in a moving @entity26 documentary called " isolation . " a week before we set off for the embed , i asked @entity47 what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said : " not only are the @entity95 's most elite soldiers , they are the most brutal of @entity26 troops . that means the rest of the @entity26 army are simply in awe of them . i would say around 90 per cent of the @entity104 ( the @entity26 equivalent of the @entity106 ) comes from the @entity65 . and so the troops you are going to be sleeping next to every night are some of the hardest men in the world . " " recently what 's happened is that many former veterans have had a " call to arms " and returned to the forces again . life in @entity116 ( civilian ) street has been a huge disappointment for many of these guys . once you 've fought ' in - theater ' a number of times it 's really hard for you to come back and fit in with the hum - drum of modern life . especially if you 're a @entity129 they miss the camaraderie and the discipline and the action that you get when you 're in combat . " see the rest of @entity30 in the @entity26 at @entity9 " when @entity30 first kicked off , all three battalions of the @entity65 were sent straight there because of their reputation for violence and bravery . i remember it was in @entity40 2006 that @entity30 became very hairy indeed . the @entity23 were there when it became very intense and at the time a member of parliament called @entity143 was quoted as saying , ' i 'd be quite happy that a single shot is not fired in @entity30 . ' in reality the @entity23 were firing off more rounds in @entity40 than the entire @entity148 war ! " grinning nervously , i asked him if there 's anything else i should know and he looked at me and said , " they all drink rivers of lager . " before we set off to meet the @entity65 , @entity47 introduced us to a young man named @entity158 who 'd been a private in the @entity160 . @entity158 had a significant part of his brain blown out of his head by a mortar attack and was slowly rehabilitating himself at his home in a small town near @entity167 . @entity158 talked to us about his love for the army and for war . the severe injuries to his brain did n't seem to change his love for army life one iota . the more we spoke to him , the more we knew we had to include him in our film . but first we had to go meet the @entity65 . with the help of my co-producer @entity179 , we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the @entity26 countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the @entity26 army . it all started off nice and civilized . we were met on the door by a dashing officer who arranged for a private to show us our room -- a basic little number in the middle of the barracks which , while not five star , would certainly meet our needs for the week . i remember feeling pretty pleased with ourselves that we 'd been given this amazing access , thinking we 'd have carte blanche to wander around and check out the comings and goings of the most elite units in the world . " ah , " we thought , " this should be an informative and relaxing few days in the countryside . i do n't know what we were worried about at all . " soon we were put in jeep , driven an hour - and - a - half away to a gloomy brick building in the middle of nowhere and told that the next time we slept in a bed would be in five days time . as we stepped out of the van about 200 @entity65 troops stared at us with eyes that said : " who are these wimps ? " the dark fell fast . a cold wind started blowing and i suddenly realized we 'd left all our warm clothes in the barracks miles away . then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops . and off we marched into the night .	@entity23:Parachute Regiment	@entity20:English	@entity26:British	@entity25:Thetford	@entity116:civvy	@entity158:Richard	@entity3:CNN.com	@entity7:Brooklyn	@entity5:Vice Magazine	@entity179:Jason Mojica	@entity9:VBS	@entity8:New York	@entity53:Iraq	@entity30:Afghan	@entity19:London	@entity104:SAS	@entity106:Special Forces	@entity129:Para.	@entity95:Parachute Regiment Britain	@entity160:Royal Anglians	@entity167:Leicestershire	@entity143:John Reid	@entity148:Korean	@entity45:ex-Para	@entity47:Stuart	@entity40:Helmand	@entity67:Northern Ireland	@entity65:Para
@entity139 , @entity140 , @entity138 and @placeholder made changes to enhance embassy security	@entity141	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity2 @entity1 in @entity3 , which was closed over the weekend because of security concerns , reopened tuesday , a day after @entity3 forces conducted successful security operations . a statement posted on the embassy 's web site said " successful counter-terrorism operations " conducted by @entity3 security forces on monday , north of the @entity3 capital , @entity11 , addressed " a specific area of concern and have contributed to the @entity1 's decision to resume operations . " @entity3 's state - run news agency , @entity19 , reported monday that two @entity21 suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a @entity3 anti-terrorism unit however , @entity25 , the @entity21 unit 's leader , and an unknown number of his " companions " were able to escape during the clashes , @entity19 reported , citing @entity3 's @entity31 . the @entity2 @entity1 said the threat of terrorist attacks against @entity2 interests in @entity3 " remains high , " and it urged @entity2 citizens in the country " to be vigilant and take prudent security measures . " @entity3 fertile ground for terror groups a senior @entity41 official , who did not want to speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the information , said @entity3 authorities have helped the @entity2 with additional security precautions at the embassy site . the @entity2 ' decision to close its embassy came after intelligence suggested that four @entity21 operatives were planning an attack on the compound , a senior administration official said monday . the official said the @entity2 had information that a group of eight terrorists had been planning an attack . @entity3 forces killed three in recent days and another was captured wearing a suicide vest , but the other four were believed to be at large , the official said . it was not immediately clear if the same @entity21 members in monday 's clashes were among the group of eight suspected terrorists . @entity2 lawmakers have highlighted what they say are the threats posed by terrorists in @entity3 . " as we commit ourselves to the fight in @entity70 , some of the what i 'll call the enemy forces , the extremist forces , move to new bases of operation such as @entity3 , from which they strike us , " said sen. @entity71 , i - @entity73 , at a news conference with sen. @entity75 in @entity76 tuesday . " i 've been quoting something that was said to us by an @entity2 working in @entity3 when sen. @entity75 and i visited in august , which was perhaps a bit overstated but it makes a point . he said to me : ' @entity76 was yesterday 's war . @entity70 is today 's war . and if we do not act preemptively now , @entity3 will be tomorrow 's war . ' " @entity75 noted that on the visit he had a " very strong impression " about the nation 's difficulties , particularly the presence of @entity21 . " the government of @entity3 is going to need our help in combatting @entity21 , " @entity75 , @entity101 , said . " there needs to be significant effort made in improving their economy , and we can not allow @entity3 to be a base for @entity21 to mount attacks on other countries in the region as well as the @entity2 " on monday , @entity2 secretary of state @entity112 called the situation in @entity3 a possible threat to regional and global security , but commended @entity3 for taking action against @entity21 networks . the @entity2 and @entity118 closed their embassies sunday . @entity118 's @entity121 also cited security concerns and its embassy remained closed tuesday . " the @entity127 embassy in @entity3 will remain closed to the public today , " a statement from the embassy said . " some embassy personnel will be in and whoever needs to contact the embassy can do it via the phone or e-mail but people wo n't be able to walk into the embassy . " several other nations also made changes at their @entity3 - based embassies monday , including @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 . each cited the need for increased security measures . @entity139 closed its embassy to the public , although @entity139 @entity147 spokesman @entity146 said tuesday that embassy employees will continue their work . @entity146 said the embassy will reopen once work to secure the site , already in progress before the latest threat , is finished . @entity140 also restricted public access to its embassy , the @entity140 @entity147 said , adding that the embassy continued to function " normally . " @entity138 halted service at the consulate section of its embassy . the @entity159 said the decision was based on the threat of terror , not a specific threat . @entity141 said that while its embassy remained fully operational , security measures were increased . the @entity165 said fewer visitors were allowed into the embassy compound . the wave of concerns follow last month 's alleged attempted terrorist attack by a @entity172 man who boarded a flight in @entity174 , @entity175 , and allegedly tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight approached @entity179 , @entity180 . the attempt failed , and other passengers and crew grabbed the suspect . the @entity3 - based @entity185 claimed responsibility for the @entity188 plot . @entity2 president @entity189 has also linked the suspect , @entity190 , to the group , which is a combination of @entity21 networks in @entity194 and @entity3 . the @entity185 group in @entity3 has said that the attempted attack on the airliner was in retaliation for airstrikes against it on december 17 and 24 . however , @entity3 has said that @entity190 purchased his ticket on december 16 . the @entity2 @entity1 in @entity3 has come under attack numerous times in recent years . in september 2008 , 10 people were killed -- among them police and civilians , but no embassy employees -- when insurgents opened fire and set off explosions outside the compound .	@entity21:al Qaeda	@entity25:Mohamed Ahmed al-Haniq	@entity159:Japanese Foreign Ministry	@entity139:France	@entity138:Japan	@entity118:Great Britain	@entity3:Yemen	@entity2:U.S.	@entity1:Embassy	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:Netherlands	@entity174:Amsterdam	@entity179:Detroit	@entity194:Saudi Arabia	@entity190:AbdulMutallab	@entity75:McCain	@entity76:Iraq	@entity71:Joe Lieberman	@entity70:Afghanistan	@entity73:Connecticut	@entity31:Interior Ministry	@entity11:Sanaa	@entity19:SABA	@entity101:R-Arizona	@entity172:Nigerian	@entity127:British	@entity121:Foreign Office	@entity188:Christmas Day	@entity189:Barack Obama	@entity146:Valero	@entity147:Foreign Ministry	@entity140:Spain	@entity141:Germany	@entity165:German Foreign Ministry	@entity180:Michigan	@entity185:AQAP	@entity41:State Department	@entity112:Hillary Clinton
former @entity6 pm asks " all the world " for help in stopping @placeholder from losing @entity17	@entity6	@entity0 showed no signs of backing down monday even as world leaders threatened sanctions and sternly rebuked the country for sending troops into @entity6 . at an emergency @entity9 meeting to discuss the unfolding crisis , @entity6 's envoy asked for help , saying that @entity0 had used planes , boats and helicopters to flood the @entity6 peninsula of @entity17 with 16,000 troops in the past week . " so far , @entity6 armed forces have exercised restraint and refrained from active resistance to the aggression , but they are in full operational readiness , " @entity6 ambassador @entity19 said . as diplomats at the meeting asked @entity0 to withdraw its troops and called for mediation to end the crisis , @entity0 ambassador @entity25 insisted his country 's aims were preserving democracy , protecting millions of @entity0 in @entity6 and stopping radical extremists . he said ousted president @entity35 remains @entity6 's elected leader and has asked @entity0 to send troops . the @entity0 envoy read a letter from @entity35 at the @entity9 meeting , describing @entity6 as a country " on the brink of civil war , " plagued by " chaos and anarchy . " " people are being persecuted for language and political reasons , " the letter said . " so in this regard , i would call on the president of @entity0 , mr. @entity50 , asking him to use the @entity51 to establish legitimacy , peace , law and order , stability and defending the people of @entity6 .

" @entity35 , she said , abandoned his post last month and was then voted out of office by @entity6 's democratically elected parliament . " @entity0 military action is not a human rights protection mission , " @entity58 said . " it is a violation of international law . " earlier monday , global stocks slipped on fears things could get worse , and diplomats grasped for a way to stop the situation from escalating . @entity78 foreign secretary @entity77 called the situation @entity80 's most serious crisis of the still - young 21st century . and @entity59 president @entity81 said the @entity59 is examining a series of economic and diplomatic steps to " isolate @entity0 , " and he called on @entity84 to work with his administration on an economic assistance package for @entity6 . tensions mount in @entity17 , more @entity0 troops arrived , surrounding military posts and other facilities and taking effective control of the peninsula from @entity6 authorities . what they planned to do next remained unclear . analysts told @entity96 the apparently growing presence of @entity0 troops in @entity17 means there 's a risk the tense standoff could escalate . " there are lots of unintended consequences when you have armed men staring at each other in places like you do in @entity17 , " said @entity102 , the former @entity59 ambassador to @entity0 . " so i think we all need to be very vigilant and worry about the worst case scenario , because it 's no one 's interest ... to see all out civil war in this country in the heart of @entity80 of 50 million people .

" @entity50 has been trying to figure out what to do . so now he 's taking these steps , " @entity123 said . " and i think that he probably thinks that they 're carefully calibrated . but he really is playing with fire . " in one ominous incident , a @entity131 spokesman said the commander of @entity0 's @entity135 fleet boarded a blocked @entity6 warship and issued a threat . " swear allegiance to the new @entity17 authorities , or surrender , or face an attack , " he said , according to the spokesman , @entity138 . but a spokesman for the @entity0 @entity144 said there are no plans to storm @entity6 military units in @entity17 , according to the state - run @entity149 news agency . and one @entity17 official has reportedly described the situation there as quiet . despite the assurances , stocks fell around the world , with @entity0 stocks leading the way as investors parsed the day 's developments . markets declined in @entity161 , @entity80 and the @entity59 , where the benchmark @entity162 fell 153 points monday . @entity165 spokeswoman @entity164 said monday that sanctions against @entity0 were n't just possible , but likely . @entity6 's shaky new government has mobilized troops and called up military reservists . in @entity172 , interim prime minister @entity170 , who has accused @entity125 of declaring war , vowed that his west - leaning government would not give up the region . " nobody will give @entity17 away . ... there are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and @entity6 , and for the entry of the @entity0 military contingent , " he said . " @entity0 never had any grounds and never will . " a strange scene : somewhat polite standoff in @entity17 if judged by the numbers , @entity6 's military loses war with @entity0 worried @entity190 the tensions have worried the @entity190 , and @entity0 's @entity193 partners have condemned @entity125 's military buildup in @entity17 . the world 's seven major industrialized powers also suspended preparations for the @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity0 , in june . their finance ministers announced some economic support for cash - strapped @entity6 . " we are also committed to mobilize rapid technical assistance to support @entity6 in addressing its macroeconomic , regulatory , and anti-corruption challenges , " the finance ministers said in a written statement . @entity59 secretary of state @entity208 , due in @entity172 tuesday , said several foreign powers are looking at economic consequences if @entity0 does not withdraw its forces . the @entity59 has suspended upcoming trade and investment talks with @entity0 due to the events in @entity6 , a spokesman for the @entity59 trade representative said monday . @entity81 said monday that @entity0 should consider international condemnation of its military moves in @entity6 , adding that " over time , this will be a costly proposition " due to sanctions and isolation that will result if the situation continues or worsens . @entity208 will offer @entity6 a " specific " package of @entity59 economic aid when he travels to @entity172 for talks tuesday , @entity81 said . @entity228 chancellor @entity227 's office said @entity50 had accepted a proposal to establish a " fact - finding mission " to @entity6 , possibly under the leadership of the @entity231 , and to start a political dialogue . how is the rest of the world reacting ? east vs. @entity236 @entity6 , a nation of 45 million people sandwiched between @entity80 and @entity0 's southwestern border , has been in chaos since @entity35 was ousted on february 22 after bloody street protests that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded . anti-government demonstrations started in late november , when @entity35 spurned a deal with the @entity244 , favoring closer ties with @entity125 instead . @entity6 has faced a deepening split , with those in the west generally supporting the interim government and its @entity244 tilt , while many in the east prefer a @entity6 where @entity0 casts a long shadow . nowhere is that feeling more intense than in @entity17 , the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership . @entity6 suspects @entity0 of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate into a bid for separation by its @entity0 majority . @entity6 leaders and commentators have compared events in @entity17 to what happened in @entity266 in 2008 . then , cross-border tensions with @entity0 exploded into a five - day conflict that saw @entity0 tanks and troops pour into the breakaway territories of @entity272 and @entity273 , as well as @entity266 cities . @entity0 and @entity266 each blamed the other for starting the conflict . @entity125 has defended its parliament 's approval of @entity50 's use of military force to protect its citizens in the @entity17 , an autonomous region of eastern @entity6 with strong loyalty to @entity0 . but @entity6 's ambassador to the @entity9 says @entity0 's reasoning for a possible invasion is fake .

@placeholder : we might as well develop sustainable approaches to solving crises in real time	@entity176	( @entity0 ) -- so is this the " new normal " ? that 's the question i keep hearing as people try to comprehend the tragedy at the @entity6 and its chaotic aftermath . the answer is yes -- in more ways than you might think . i do n't mean that we 're supposed to get used to explosions , school shootings and other threats arising seemingly randomly and without warning . but we should accept that the old ways of understanding and responding to conflicts and threats no longer apply . in an always - on , post-narrative age , 24 - hour cable and internet news and @entity23 feeds offer a steady stream of opportunities for panic and misinformation . we have a suspect ; no , we do n't ; yes , we do . the school is on lockdown ; no , it 's not . false alarms are still alarms , after all . it 's like we are all living in newsrooms , or as 911 operators or air - traffic controllers , for all the emergency interruptions and bulletins we navigate practically every hour . then consider the equally unnerving limbo we endure once there 's nothing new to report . the stakes are too high to return to regular programming , so we just sit there , poised on high alert along with the police and journalists . this time , it was flashing blue lights and the search for a suspect . before that , it was the live feed of @entity56 in the corner of the screen for weeks , belching oil into the sea . whether interruptive or chronic , the anxiety keeps pouring in . we live in a state of " present shock . " that was the week from hell and even if network anchors still had the authority they once did , they would not be able construct a satisfying story around the onslaught of neverending news . when the journalists cheered as the police caught the marathon bombings suspect in the boat , it seemed that they were mostly relieved at reaching a definitive conclusion to a neverending news cycle . one news anchor actually declared " justice won " as she was at last permitted to cut to commercial . it rang false , because there 's no genuine finality anymore . the story just does n't end . nor does the anxiety . for it 's not so much a matter of responding to a particular crisis , threat or tragedy but of coping with the persistent flow of urgency itself . some of the unease we feel with the @entity98 bombings comes from the nagging sense that we have no way of gauging where we are in the arc of violence . is this the beginning of a new series of attacks , a rare event like the @entity109 bombing or part of some greater conspiracy yet to be revealed ? of course , none of the usual narratives apply , for we no longer live in a world with beginnings , middles and ends . that quaint structure went out with the @entity118 and the moon shot . we no longer design career paths ; we no longer invest in the future . we occupy ; we freelance ; we trade derivatives . everything happens in the now . even terror . while there are certainly groups such as @entity128 with political goals and a modicum of organization , for every plotted attack with strategic goals , there are many more that arise haphazardly , randomly -- by either sympathizers , copycats or mentally ill nihilists with no political justification whatsoever . @entity98 's week of terror we 're no longer fighting enemies in the normal sense . we can not begin a war on terrorism and then declare victory when we 're done . we ca n't stick a flag in it and call it won . no , the challenges of a post-industrial society are less like conquests with clear endpoints than they are steady - state concerns . oil is spilling . the climate is changing . terrorists are plotting . crises are never quite solved for the future so much as managed in the present . but accepting the essentially plotless and ongoing nature of crisis need n't compromise our ability to respond appropriately and effectively . in fact , by freeing ourselves from the obsolete narratives we used to rely on , we can begin to recognize the patterns in the apparent chaos . we may not get answers to rally around or satisfyingly dramatic finales , but neither will we need to invent compelling , false stories to motivate ourselves into action . in a world where crises are constant and perpetual , we might as well begin to develop more sustainable approaches to solving them in real time , rather than once and for all . life goes on . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .	@entity23:Twitter	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Boston Marathon	@entity176:Rushkoff	@entity56:Deepwater Horizon	@entity128:al Qaeda	@entity98:Boston	@entity109:Oklahoma City	@entity118:Industrial Age

" her endorsement was met with a scattering of boos and thumbs downs from the crowd at the @entity28 in @entity29 . watch @entity8 urge voters to back @entity6 » in a @entity0 poll released friday , 60 percent of @entity8 supporters said they would vote for @entity6 , but 17 percent said they would vote for @entity33 and 22 percent , said they would not vote at all if @entity8 were not the nominee . watch how @entity8 's speech might impact voters » the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 7.5 percentage points . the poll was conducted after @entity6 clinched the @entity11 nomination tuesday . @entity8 has vowed to do whatever she could " to ensure that @entity11 take the @entity16 back and defeat @entity33 . " concern about the division in the party arose because @entity8 and @entity6 appealed to such different segments of the electorate . @entity8 did well with working - class voters and the elderly . @entity6 rallied the support of affluent , well - educated voters , african - americans and the younger generation . some of @entity8 's top supporters say the best way to get the @entity60 senator 's 18 million voters behind @entity6 is by putting @entity8 on the ticket . @entity11 appear to like an @entity6 - @entity8 ticket . a @entity0 poll released friday suggested that nearly half of those voting democrats , 54 percent , would support a joint ticket , but 43 percent would oppose it . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . " i 've looked at every other possible candidate . no one brings to a ticket what @entity3 brings , " sen. @entity74 said sunday on @entity76 's " @entity75 . " but not everyone is behind the idea of a joint ticket . former president @entity83 said that would be " the worst mistake that could be made . " " that would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates , " @entity83 told @entity86 , a @entity87 newspaper , saying that both candidates ' vulnerabilities could overshadow the ticket if the two team up . ireport.com : share your thoughts on a " joint ticket " @entity74 said she thinks @entity6 needs to reach out to the @entity8 supporters " using sen. @entity8 's help . " " he needs to reassure them as to what he would do in the agenda for change , because the comparisons with @entity33 are very stark . certainly with respect to the economy , extending unemployment insurance , building infrastructure , " she said . @entity6 and @entity8 met in @entity74 's @entity29 home on thursday . they spoke alone for about an hour , in a move seen as the first step in healing the rifts in the party . @entity74 said she chatted with @entity8 before @entity6 arrived . " she expressed to me the depth of her concern and caring , the fact that she had 18 million who put their hopes and dreams in her ability to create new opportunities for people . she wants to continue that . she recognizes that it 's over , and i think every instinct in @entity3 is to help , " she said . the main page on @entity6 's web site has been updated with a message that says , " thank you senator @entity8 , " and links to a form where visitors can send a message to her . @entity8 's web site now urges visitors to " support senator @entity6 today . " @entity0 analyst @entity141 said @entity8 must speak to the female voters who supported her , " many of whom are so angry about this race . " " she really has to tell women why @entity6 is the best candidate for president , " @entity141 said . " she has to go a long way to try [ to ] get rid of that anger . " @entity0 senior political producer @entity151 said @entity8 's speech was a " first step " in making inroads to persuade her supporters to back @entity6 , but she said it 's too early to tell what the effect will be . " i would argue that most of the people in that room want a @entity11 president and will come around , and those that still are n't sure yet will probably come around , but again , i think some wo n't . this was a hard primary for @entity11 , " she said . shortly after the speech , @entity6 released a statement praising @entity8 's presidential run . " obviously , i am thrilled and honored to have sen. @entity8 's support . but more than that , i honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run . she shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere , who now know that there are no limits to their dreams . and she inspired millions with her strength , courage and unyielding commitment to the cause of working @entity185 .

@entity0 takes you through the top historical sights not to be missed in @placeholder	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has not been nicknamed " @entity3 " or " @entity1 " for no good reason . the well - deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture , history , art and beauty like no other . while not forgetting its more somber communist past , @entity1 has been one of the first @entity15 cities to get a luxurious makeover . designer shopping malls , exclusive restaurants and trendy nightclubs abound . but it is the mystical atmosphere of a @entity1 of past eras that leaves many visitors craving to come back . largely untouched by the ravages of @entity24 , @entity1 is arguably the only @entity15 city with so many century - old buildings left intact for people to enjoy . all more impressive than the others , these are the historical sites you should not miss in @entity1 . @entity31 : in 1348 , @entity32 of @entity33 ( now the @entity34 ) founded the town of @entity1 . the @entity32 built several open areas for markets , including @entity31 , previously known as the @entity38 . named after @entity40 , the patron saint of the @entity34 state , the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of @entity1 's history , including the @entity46 occupation , the @entity48 invasion , and the @entity49 . in 1969 , @entity1 student @entity50 set himself on fire in @entity31 to protest the @entity48 invasion of @entity53 . and in 1989 , during the @entity49 that overthrew the @entity56 regime , hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest . today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country . lining @entity31 are fashion stores , cafes , bars and kiosks . above the square is @entity1 's @entity66 , which was shot at by @entity56 troops when they mistook it for the @entity69 building . @entity70 : @entity71 , @entity72 and presidents have lived in this legendary castle that overlooks the city . the castle is the largest medieval castle complex in @entity77 and arguable @entity1 's prime tourist attraction . first built in the 9th century , @entity70 has survived wars , fires and opposing political powers . the castle complex consists of the @entity83 , viewing towers , a monastery , museums and art galleries . the @entity34 crown jewels are also held here . after @entity53 split into the @entity34 and @entity90 in 1993 , the castle became the seat of the president of the new @entity34 . @entity93 : this magnificent 14th century gothic bridge over @entity1 's @entity96 river is lined with a series of large stone statues that represent important religious figures and icons . its construction started in 1357 under @entity32 and finished in the beginning of the 15th century . until the 19th century , the bridge was the only way to cross between the @entity106 and adjacent areas , also known as the " @entity107 . " during the day , thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers . dancing @entity113 : a masterpiece of modern architecture , @entity114 was named after dancing duo @entity117 and @entity119 . @entity114 is also sometimes nicknamed " @entity113 " for its wavy curves . the building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by @entity34 architect @entity122 and world - renowned @entity124 architect @entity123 . the top floor houses one of the city 's most exclusive restaurants , @entity130 . @entity131 : located in the heart of the @entity106 , this square included @entity1 's gothic @entity134 before @entity136 , the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century . the church 's towers are 80 meters high and topped by small golden spires . another fixture of the @entity131 is the baroque - style @entity143 . in the center of the square is a large statue of @entity148 , a catholic priest who was burned at the stake by the @entity150 for heresy in 1415 . but the most popular attraction for visitors of the square is the famous @entity155 . astronomical clock : built in 1410 , the @entity155 still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events , such as the relative positions of the sun , moon and major planets . each hour , the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out . below the @entity155 are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac , added by painter @entity171 in 1865 . @entity172 : @entity173 's @entity83 is another one of @entity1 's @entity175 masterpieces . the @entity83 , set in the walls of the @entity70 , was commissioned by @entity177 and work on it began in 1344 . it took nearly six centuries to complete . today it is the seat of the archbishop of @entity1 and contains the tombs of many of the @entity71 . the interior features stained - glass windows from different eras . one of the cathedral 's chambers was used to crown several @entity71 and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament . @entity194 : the old fortress of @entity194 and its surrounding parks is the place where the city of @entity1 was originally founded and around which the city was built . it is a great place to get a sense of the history of the city . its thick walls house the @entity205 , where many of @entity1 's most illustrious citizens are buried , including @entity34 composer @entity207 and writer @entity208 .	@entity150:Roman Catholic Church	@entity24:WWII	@entity15:European	@entity117:Fred Astaire	@entity83:Cathedral	@entity113:Drunk House	@entity93:Charles Bridge	@entity134:Church of Our Lady	@entity136:Tyn	@entity131:Old Town Square	@entity130:Celeste	@entity119:Ginger Rogers	@entity3:Zlata Praha	@entity215:Golden City	@entity1:Prague	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:Gothic	@entity177:King Charles IV	@entity207:Antonín Leopold Dvorak	@entity194:Vyshehrad	@entity53:Czechoslovakia	@entity50:Jan Palach	@entity56:Communist	@entity77:Europe	@entity71:Kings	@entity70:Prague Castle	@entity72:Roman Emperors	@entity31:Wenceslas Square	@entity171:Josef Manes	@entity33:Bohemia	@entity32:King Charles IV	@entity34:Czech	@entity38:Horse Market	@entity173:Saint Vitus	@entity172:Prague Cathedral	@entity208:Karel Capek	@entity106:Old Town	@entity107:Lesser Town	@entity96:Vltava	@entity124:Canadian	@entity122:Vlado Milunc	@entity123:Frank Gehry	@entity205:National Cemetery	@entity90:Slovakia	@entity143:St. Nicholas Church	@entity148:Jan Hus	@entity49:Velvet Revolution	@entity46:Nazi	@entity114:Dancing House	@entity40:Saint Wenceslas	@entity69:Parliament	@entity66:Museum of Natural History	@entity48:Soviet	@entity155:Astronomical Clock

" teasing apart , @entity14 's annual earnings statement for the fiscal year that ended march 31 , the company finished the year with a profit of $ 435 million only because it sold assets worth more than $ 1.9 billion dollars . " excluding those , then @entity14 is making a big loss , " says @entity58 , director of @entity33 's @entity59 , " so it does n't mean they will return the cash to shareholders or retire their debt at an accelerated pace -- but that they intend to invest in strategically important businesses . " those businesses may involve bulking up @entity14 's relatively small imaging business , including cameras and sensors , and its music and movie divisions . recent cinema hits that helped @entity14 , include the latest @entity76 installment " @entity82 , " which pulled in more than $ 1 billion at the global box office , along with the " @entity81 " movie trilogy with @entity79 and the " @entity81 " reboot in 2012 . the question , however , is will @entity14 's leadership send funds that foster more growth in such divisions ? " the short answer is ' we 'll have to see ' . it 's too early to say whether the company is going down that path on focusing on a small number of profitable products , " says @entity30 . " at one stage last year , people were seriously debating whether @entity14 should stop making tvs . i remain to be convinced if they can make a profit , but in their latest statement they seem to be committed to the television segment and believe they can grow sales and return to profit . and if they can , i congratulate them . " @entity14 's television division has been a loss maker over the past several years , adds @entity30 , as has @entity14 's flagship smartphone , the @entity111 " by all accounts it 's a good phone . it 's one of the sturdiest phones on the market . but i think i only know two people who use it , " he adds . of @entity2 's tech firms , @entity33 only ranks @entity14 , @entity40 and @entity39 . all three have speculative ratings with negative outlooks . @entity2 autos : ' they 're back to compete ' while the forecast for a resurgence in @entity2 technology innovation appears in doubt , the prediction for @entity2 's automobile exports seems more enthusiastic as the yen has weakened . in @entity135 's recent earnings report for the fiscal year ended march 31 , the world 's biggest automaker reported net income of $ 9.7 billion -- more than triple its earnings from the year prior . " @entity2 automakers have regained confidence and momentum . in the auto industry , momentum is everything , " says @entity142 , president of @entity143 and @entity144 and author of @entity146 wheels , @entity148 roads . " this is n't a temporary blip . they 're back to compete . " still , adds @entity143 , @entity2 's auto sector faces growth challenges because of regional politics in @entity158 , global competition and a lack of innovation which a weaker yen can not help . chronic tensions between @entity2 and @entity148 over territorial disputes in the @entity165 have dampened demand for @entity2 automobiles in @entity148 , the world 's largest car market . " they ( @entity2 automakers ) will sell three million cars there this year but it could be much higher . if they get things right , within five years it could easily get to five million , " says @entity143 . " dealers say a good benchmark is showroom traffic . in @entity148 , because of the tension , dealers i know say in october and november of last year that showroom traffic at @entity2 dealerships was down by half . it 's recovering slowly . " competition from @entity186 and @entity187 's @entity188 automakers -- @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 -- has also been rising . to push back , @entity143 says using new - found profits from a weaker yen to move manufacturing plants to cheaper locales overseas is one way to stay competitive -- as long as the pace of expansion is controlled . " one thing is @entity135 began an aggressive schedule to open more production bases overseas but that was the beginning of its problems . to duplicate the quality and fastidiousness of @entity2 plants was difficult . they were running to be number one at the expense of quality . " @entity135 's well - documented crises of quality from 2009 and 2010 set the company back in consumers ' eyes , says @entity143 , which has led to challenges from other carmakers . " the threat from ( @entity186 's ) @entity221 has been well documented . @entity146 automakers have boosted quality , innovation and styling too , " says @entity143 . " for example , the @entity226 has been a spectacular success . it was the best - selling model in 2012 but @entity135 's @entity230 had perennially been the best - selling car over the ten years before that . " but @entity143 adds @entity135 is slowly regaining customer trust after a series of recalls . in december 2012 , @entity135 agreed to pay $ 1.1 billion to settle a class - action suit by car owners who claimed they suffered economic losses because of unintended acceleration in its cars . that same month , the company also agreed to pay a record $ 17.4 million to the @entity146 @entity242 for problems that led to a 2012 recall in one of its @entity247 models . as for direction at the world 's largest automaker , @entity143 says he has heard good things about the leadership style of @entity135 's president and ceo that aims to foster innovation . " i hear @entity257 enters a room with an entourage of extremely bright engineers and colleagues but he also says ' do n't get too burrowed in ' and ' let 's open our eyes and see what we can do differently ' . it seems there 's an awakening among the @entity2 .

73 % in @entity9 / @entity8 poll say @placeholder should be arrested	@entity16	one month after the shooting death of @entity1 , nearly three out of four @entity2 say the police should arrest the neighborhood watch volunteer who pulled the trigger , according to a new national survey . and the @entity9 / @entity8 poll released monday also indicates that three - quarters of the public says that neighborhood watch members should not be allowed to carry weapons . seventy - three percent of people questioned in the survey say that @entity16 should be arrested , with 11 % disagreeing and 16 % unsure . @entity16 admits to shooting and killing @entity1 , an unarmed @entity17 - @entity2 teenager , in @entity18 , @entity19 , on february 26 . calls for justice rage on in @entity1 's killing @entity16 , 28 , claims @entity1 attacked him and he shot in self - defense , according to police . @entity1 's family and supporters say the unarmed 17 - year - old was no more threatening than the bag of @entity29 candy and the iced tea he was carrying . the shooting has grabbed national headlines and has renewed the national conversation about race relations , gun laws , and even how young men dress . it sparked a national furor that reached all the way to the @entity42 , prompting president @entity43 last week to call for national soul - searching to discover how something so tragic could happen . protests continue monday , with rallies planned for major cities across the country . are you attending a rally ? tell us why you march for @entity1 @entity16 is a white @entity53 , and family and supporters of @entity1 believe race was an issue in the shooting . @entity16 's family say he has been mistakenly portrayed as racist . a special prosecutor is investigating the case , with a grand jury scheduled to begin deliberations on april 10 . the prosecutor , @entity65 , said last week that she does not know if a grand jury will be necessary . " nearly two - thirds of whites and 86 % of non-whites say @entity16 should be arrested , " says @entity9 polling director @entity67 , " as well as majorities of @entity71 , @entity72 and independent voters . " @entity18 authorities say they could not arrest @entity16 under @entity19 's " stand your ground " law , which allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury . the evidence police had at the time did n't allow for an arrest , police have said . @entity16 's attorney said sunday that after reviewing @entity19 's " stand your ground " law , he believes it applies to the situation and that his client is innocent . shooting renews debate over ' stand your ground ' laws @entity16 said he was driving in his gated community when he saw @entity1 walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person . he told the dispatcher he was following the teen , but the dispatcher told him that was n't necessary . moments later , several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside , and police arrived to find @entity1 dead of a gunshot wound . the survey indicates that 55 % of all @entity2 approve of so - called " stand your ground " laws , although there is a big gender gap on that question , with men approving of the laws 64 % -34 % and women opposing the measures 52 % -46 % . according to the poll , only one in five believe that neighborhood watch members should carry guns , with 76 % saying they should not be allowed to be armed . the @entity9 poll was conducted by @entity8 on saturday and sunday , with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone . the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .	@entity17:African	@entity2:Americans	@entity1:Martin	@entity8:ORC International	@entity16:George Zimmerman	@entity9:CNN	@entity29:Skittles	@entity19:Florida	@entity18:Sanford	@entity53:Hispanic	@entity42:White House	@entity43:Barack Obama	@entity67:Keating Holland	@entity65:Angela Corey	@entity71:Republicans	@entity72:Democrats

@entity234 : a year ago , @entity162 warned @entity4 of " red line " ; now u.s.hitting @placeholder 's enemy	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 had already telegraphed plans to attack terrorist targets in @entity4 , but the operation that unfolded over @entity4 skies overnight brought several significant and revealing surprises . here are five important ones : 1 . @entity10 countries joined in attacking @entity11 . it was always crucial that @entity13 keep this fight against the so - called @entity15 from becoming another @entity1 war , and especially that it deny extremists the ability to portray it as a war against @entity20 or against @entity10 . this opening salvo in @entity4 is an important step in that direction . the @entity1 reported that @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity27 and @entity28 -- all @entity30 states -- " participated in or supported " strikes against @entity11 , which is also @entity30 and violently anti-shiite . the " supported " part probably applies to @entity28 , whose participation in any capacity is quite a surprise . @entity28 has actively backed the opposition against @entity4 president @entity38 , and many blame it for funneling the support that allowed @entity42 groups to emerge as the dominant segment of the anti-al - @entity38 forces . 2 . the @entity1 did n't just hit @entity11 , it targeted @entity48 's @entity47 's " imminent " attack on @entity1 . this news bombshell was hidden in the @entity51 's press release , which said the @entity1 " took action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the @entity1 and @entity55 interests . " until now , the debate over whether or not the @entity1 should strike in @entity4 has referred specifically to the threat posed by @entity11 , but outside the @entity1 , there has been growing concern about the rise of @entity62 , a group made up of highly experienced @entity48 fighters . @entity64 said @entity1 forces -- without @entity10 participation -- struck explosives and munitions depots , training camps and other @entity62 facilities . by attacking @entity48 , the @entity1 is helping prevent another militant group from filling the vacuum when and if @entity11 loses strength in @entity4 . defanging @entity62 would make it possible for moderate @entity4 rebels -- rather that @entity38 regime forces or other extremists --- to move in where @entity11 falls back . 3 . the rise of @entity11 has triggered jihadi competition to strike the @entity1 . the emergence of @entity62 as a major player in @entity4 points to the intensity of rivalry between jihadi groups in @entity4 . that is good news in the sense that @entity11 and @entity48 have more enemies , but it is extremely dangerous because jihadi groups are likely to try to upstage one another by hitting @entity1 and @entity55 targets . the @entity47 is headed by @entity93 , a 33 - year - old @entity94 who has topped most - wanted lists in many countries . he reportedly played a major role in the acrimonious breakup in @entity4 between @entity11 and @entity48 . @entity100 and @entity11 leader @entity101 operate from a personal enmity . as @entity104 seeks to topple @entity48 as the leader of global jihad , it is reasonable to expect that the two organizations will compete for adherents and prestige by seeking to attack @entity1 and @entity110 . 4 . @entity111 did n't respond , but a @entity4 fighter jet crossed into @entity113 and was shot down . the most daunting aspect of the fight against @entity42 extremists in @entity4 is that they seek to topple @entity38 . meanwhile , @entity1 's position remains that @entity38 should leave power . the enemy of their enemy is no friend of the @entity1 . @entity13 maintains that it did not seek permission from @entity38 to strike inside his country and there was " no coordination or cooperation " with either @entity4 or its ally , @entity127 . @entity4 's foreign ministry says the @entity1 informed its @entity132 envoy before striking on its territory . @entity134 did not lift a finger to object to the violation of its airspace by a hostile military coalition . there was , however , another incident . @entity113 says that early tuesday a @entity4 fighter jet infiltrated @entity113 airspace and was shot down . the pilots ejected safely into @entity4 space . @entity113 says the plane flew half a mile into its territory and says it has no intention of becoming involved in the war in @entity4 . it was the first time in more than two decades that @entity113 has intercepted a @entity4 military plane , and a retired @entity113 general told the @entity152 he thought the incursion was not deliberate . whatever triggered the incident , it is further evidence of just how dangerous the @entity4 conflict is , and how easily it could continue to expand into new territories . 5 . @entity1 's timing is smart , strategic and a little embarrassing . the timing of @entity1 's first direct hit inside @entity4 comes almost exactly a year after president @entity162 announced he would strike against @entity38 's forces because they had crossed his " red line " by using chemical weapons . that did not happen . now @entity162 is hitting @entity38 's enemies . the irony is more than a little awkward , but the timing could prove politically productive . the attacks came just hours before @entity162 's scheduled speech to the @entity172 , an annual gathering that not only provides an important platform to address the international community but also offers almost unlimited possibilities for face - to - face meetings with world leaders . the @entity1 is in the middle of a major diplomatic push to build up support against @entity11 . at the @entity132 , @entity162 will make the case for the rightness of the cause against the murderous extremists seeking to terrorize the @entity186 and the world . he also needs to invigorate the push for a less sectarian government in @entity190 , so that the country 's @entity191 and @entity30 will join in the life - and - death struggle against @entity11 . he will seek to enlist new allies in the fight and bring old ones -- notably @entity197 -- into line . after years of resisting intervention in @entity4 , after more than 200,000 people have died , millions have been displaced there , and after the @entity4 civil war has metastasized and spread , fracturing @entity190 and sending millions of refugees into @entity25 , @entity203 , @entity197 and elsewhere , the @entity1 finally decided to act . that it eventually would have no choice but to do so is hardly unexpected . but there are sure to be many more surprises in the months to come . there is ample irony in the timing and the occasion -- the highest - profile meeting of the world 's foremost peace organization -- but there is also news that the people in @entity11 - controlled parts of @entity4 are quietly celebrating @entity1 's newfound resolve .	@entity20:Muslims	@entity26:Saudi Arabia	@entity27:United Arab Emirates	@entity24:Bahrain	@entity25:Jordan	@entity28:Qatar	@entity113:Israeli	@entity111:Al-Assad	@entity110:Europeans	@entity134:Damascus	@entity132:United Nations	@entity1:U.S.	@entity0:CNN	@entity234:Ghitis	@entity4:Syria	@entity197:Turkey	@entity191:Shiites	@entity190:Iraq	@entity51:Pentagon	@entity55:Western	@entity30:Sunnis	@entity15:Islamic State	@entity13:Washington	@entity11:ISIS	@entity10:Arab	@entity152:New York Times	@entity38:al-Assad	@entity100:Al Fadhli	@entity101:Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi	@entity172:U.N.

there was a great deal going on during the 2014 @placeholder pageant	@entity88	( @entity0 ) -- after nearly a week of high - heeled dancing , @entity4 - covered teeth , and skillfully concealed hostility , the glitter has finally settled over @entity6 — and 24 - year - old @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 has been named the latest in a long line of all - american beauty queens . @entity7 is n't just the second consecutive pageant winner from the @entity13 — she 's also the first woman of @entity15 descent to snag the crown . obviously , congratulations are in order — but @entity7 's not the only one who deserves a little recognition . check out my list of alternate - category winners , and feel free to add your own ... as long as you deliver them with a blindingly white smile . most auspicious name : miss @entity28 , a.k.a. @entity30 . then again , maybe not ; she did n't even make it to the semi-finals . weirdest @entity34 : " listening to your phone calls from the nation 's capital . just kidding ! i 'm @entity40 , @entity41 . " runner up : " from the home of fast horses and beautiful women — better not get those two things confused . i am @entity46 , miss @entity47 !

( and not even the location that serves salads ! ) most @entity68 : " from the home of @entity70 , the country music capital of the world and the hit @entity74 show , i 'm @entity75 , miss @entity76 . " clumsiest attempt at @entity78 : " i 'm not breaking bad , i 'm breaking through . say my name ! @entity80 , miss @entity81 .

" strangest tradition : the @entity140 . seriously , what 's the deal with the shoe parade ? @entity144 : miss @entity54 @entity145 , who said this after preparing for the swimsuit competition in about two minutes : " i had time for hairspray and butt glue . that was it . " @entity153 glue ! i 'd have given her the crown based on butt glue alone . runner up : miss @entity158 @entity157 , a tattooed army sergeant who sings opera but prefers to play @entity160 . " my original talent was going to be archery , " she explained . " i 'm singing by default because there is a clause against projectile objects . " there is no clause against stealing our hearts , though . @entity170 : miss @entity173 @entity172 's bedazzled knee brace , a functional yet versatile piece that complements bikinis , eveningwear , and ghastly baton - twirling getups equally . ( maybe it was actually a good luck charm — @entity173 absolutely killed it in @entity179 . ) @entity0 : @entity88 pageant returns to @entity6 biggest head - scratcher : this fun fact , which flashed onscreen as miss @entity184 @entity183 sang " @entity185 " : " her dog has met the president . " think they shook hands ? worst judgment : @entity74 and the @entity88 determined that it was totally fair to ask the first finalist about @entity193 , the second about scorned political wives ... and the third whether she thinks the @entity196 should intervene in @entity197 . one of those things : not like the others ! kudos to @entity201 for keeping her cool — and actually delivering a coherent answer to that absurdly tough question . most diplomatic : miss @entity208 @entity207 , who , for the record , believes that @entity193 's antics have been " a little bit not super tasteful " — but " ha [ s ] to respect her creativity . " most skillful non-answer : as delivered by eventual winner @entity7 , miss @entity9 . she was asked what message @entity216 is sending by admitting that she 's had plastic surgery on her eyes . full transcript : " unfortunately , i do n't agree with plastic surgery . however , i can understand that from a standpoint . but more importantly , i 've always viewed @entity88 as the girl next door , and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in @entity196 evolves . she 's not who she was 10 years ago , and she 's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road . so i would n't want to change someone 's looks or appearance , but definitely be confident in who you are . " clearest foreshadowing : miss @entity9 and @entity237 stood in front of a curtain decorated with the @entity88 logo as they clutched hands , waiting to hear the panel 's final verdict . the logo includes a crown — which appeared to be floating over @entity9 's head . lesson learned for next year 's finalists : try to stand stage left . @entity250 : courtesy of @entity253 's " @entity252 , " which played as @entity7 received her actual crown : " tonight we 'll just get drunk .

@placeholder 's appeal date is yet to be confirmed by @entity1	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- a horse racing trainer who became engulfed in a doping scandal and was banned from the sport for eight years has appealed his sentence , the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has confirmed . @entity6 , who worked at the world famous @entity7 in the @entity10 town of @entity11 , was banned from horse racing after admitting injecting his thoroughbreds with steroids . the 37 - year - old admitted a " catastrophic error " in administering prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to 15 leading thoroughbreds . all 15 horses , including the former 1,000 @entity22 , were banned from racing for six months by the @entity1 . the case rocked the sport and led to @entity26 principal @entity25 -- the ruler of @entity27 -- shutting down the stables , saying he was " appalled and angered " by the doping revelations . a statement on the @entity1 's official website read : " @entity6 has lodged an appeal against the severity of his eight - year suspension from training .

a string of gang rapes in @placeholder has prompted national debate	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- an @entity1 court saturday convicted a teenage boy for his part in the gang rape last december of a medical student who later died of her injuries , sentencing him to three years in prison . the sentence drew immediate protests outside the court and from the victim 's family , who feel it is too lenient for a crime that shocked the city and prompted a nationwide debate over the treatment of women and the handling of sexual assaults . the teenager was convicted of murder , rape and robbery . his trial was in juvenile court because he was 17 at the time of the crime , and the three - year sentence is the maximum allowed under the court 's rules . protesters in the street outside the court raised their fists and shouted , " we want justice ! " if the teenager was old enough to commit the crime , they said , then he is old enough to have been tried as an adult and face the death penalty . the victim 's parents attended the trial and said they plan to appeal . " we want him to be hanged , " the victim 's visibly upset mother told reporters . " i am not at all happy with this verdict . by not punishing this teenager , this verdict is encouraging other teenagers to indulge in such acts and does not provide any safety to girls . " the teenager is the first of five suspects to be tried for their role in the attack , which happened december 16 on a moving bus in @entity0 . the group assaulted the 23 - year - old woman and her male companion , robbing them and then dumping them at the side of the road , police said . while the man was eventually discharged from the hospital , the woman was so badly hurt that she had to be airlifted to a hospital in @entity76 in " extremely critical condition , " doctors there said . she died two weeks later . the man said he and the young woman watched a movie before boarding a private bus to return to her home in a @entity0 suburb . the bus driver made lewd remarks and five other men taunted the couple and locked the doors , the man told @entity89 in january . " they hit me with a small stick and dragged my friend to a seat near the driver 's cabin , " the man said . then the " driver and the other men raped my friend and hit her in the worst possible ways in the most private parts of her body . " the driver used an iron bar in the attack , he told the news agency . the friend said he suffered a broken leg . " the cruelty i saw should not be seen ever . i tried to fight against the men but later i begged them again and again to leave her , " he said . in an interview with @entity112 , the man said the abductors drove the couple throughout the city for about two hours before dropping them below an overpass ; he was unable to stand and had no clothes . " three - wheeler taxis would slow down , take a look at us and move on , " he said . " so would cars and motorcycles . we got no help for nearly 20 or 25 minutes . " when three police vehicles finally did show up , he said , " they could n't decide among themselves which police precinct has jurisdiction . " his friend bled profusely throughout the ordeal , he said . despite the outrage over the attack , the problem of sexual violence in @entity1 persists . an @entity139 woman was raped in june after visiting a popular @entity140 in northern @entity1 . after failing to find a taxi to take her back to her hotel , she accepted a ride from three men who took her to a wooded area , then raped and robbed her , authorities said . a 4 - year - old girl died after being sexually assaulted by a 35 - year - old man in @entity151 in april , and a 5 - year - old girl was allegedly raped two weeks earlier in @entity0 . two men were arrested in that case . a @entity156 woman and her husband who were on a cycling tour across the @entity1 were attacked by a group of men in march after they set up camp near a forest in the central part of the country . the men beat the husband and raped the wife , police said . last week , a 23 - year - old female photographer was allegedly gang - raped in @entity172 by five men , the police chief there said . the woman was on assignment with a male colleague when some men approached them , took them to a nearby mill under false pretenses , then tied them both up and raped her , @entity172 police commissioner @entity174 said . the woman was in stable condition after the attack . @entity2 's @entity187 reported from @entity0 . @entity188 reported and wrote from @entity189 .	@entity188:Melissa Gray	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:India	@entity0:New Delhi	@entity140:Hindu temple	@entity174:Satypal Singh	@entity189:Atlanta	@entity187:Sumnima Udas	@entity172:Mumbai	@entity139:American	@entity112:Reuters	@entity89:Agence France-Press	@entity151:Ghansaur	@entity76:Singapore	@entity156:Swiss
@placeholder sen. @entity84 said @entity9 is simply wrong	@entity34	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination sunday to blistering criticism of the @entity7 war from former coalition commander retired lt. gen. @entity9 . lawmakers lashed back at retired gen. @entity9 on sunday after he criticized the war effort . on friday , @entity9 , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the @entity7 war " a nightmare with no end in sight . " he said the @entity17 administration , the @entity18 and @entity19 all share blame . speaking with military reporters in @entity21 , @entity9 also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable . " i 'm astounded , really , " @entity29 @entity28 sen. @entity28 on @entity1 's " @entity30 " with @entity31 on sunday . @entity28 , who recently returned from @entity32 , said he and @entity34 presidential candidate sen. @entity33 had visited @entity9 several times in 2003 and 2004 . " every time we talked to gen. @entity9 , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , " @entity28 said . he added that @entity9 's own record in @entity7 is blemished : @entity46 " got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch . " but @entity28 said that " finally , " with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional @entity52 troops since january , " we are getting it right . " @entity9 told reporters that @entity52 political leaders have cost @entity52 lives on the battlefield with their " lust for power . " @entity9 said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired . " while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , " he said . that brought a tart response from @entity33 , the ranking @entity34 on the @entity71 . " i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , " @entity33 told @entity77 's " @entity76 . " he said @entity9 should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but " unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . " one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. @entity82 , @entity33 said . @entity82 was sidelined after telling @entity19 that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy @entity7 . sen. @entity84 , a @entity28 from @entity85 , told @entity87 's " @entity86 " that @entity9 is simply wrong . " my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , " he said . " i think we 're making significant progress toward that end . " but , he added , " i think the central government in @entity7 has been an embarrassment . they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for . " @entity28 said he hopes the government of prime minister @entity107 will " step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year . " if that does not happen , he said , " it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable @entity7 . " that brought a blistering response from @entity116 , national security adviser under president @entity117 . " what is this ? this is a colony , " he said . " that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . " even those @entity7 who were happy to see @entity127 toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing @entity52 presence , @entity116 said . though some countries are willing to go along with the @entity52 , " no one in the world really supports our policy in @entity7 , " he said . in his friday speech , @entity9 added that the " surge " of @entity52 troops into @entity7 represents " a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . " @entity143 spokeswoman @entity142 did not address the comment . instead , she said , " we appreciate his service to the country . as @entity149 and ambassador @entity150 said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in @entity7 . and that 's what we 're focused on now .

" @entity31 's new ' spaceship ' campus : what will the neighbors say ? it turns out that @entity22 is right to worry . in fact , @entity31 's @entity35 spells this out : " when you use @entity6 or @entity40 , the things you say will be recorded and sent to @entity31 in order to convert what you say into text , " @entity31 says . @entity6 collects a bunch of other information -- names of people from your address book and other unspecified user data , all to help @entity6 do a better job . how long does @entity31 store all of this stuff , and who gets a look at it ? well , the company does n't actually say . again , from the user agreement : " by using @entity6 or @entity40 , you agree and consent to @entity31 's and its subsidiaries ' and agents ' transmission , collection , maintenance , processing , and use of this information , including your voice input and @entity69 , to provide and improve @entity6 , @entity40 , and other @entity31 products and services . " @entity31 and @entity73 begin settlement talks because some of the data that @entity6 collects can be very personal , the @entity75 put out a warning about @entity6 just a couple of months ago . privacy was always a big concern for @entity6 's developers , says @entity82 , the lead developer of the original @entity3 app , which was eventually acquired by @entity31 . and for corporate users , there are even more potential pitfalls . " just having it known that you 're at a certain customer 's location might be in violation of a non-disclosure agreement , " he says . @entity31 designer ' winces ' over some past product choices but he agrees that many of the issues raised by @entity31 's @entity6 data handling are similar to those that other internet companies face . " i really do n't think it 's something to worry about , " he says . " people are already doing things on these mobile devices . maybe @entity6 makes their life a little bit easier , but it 's not exactly opening up a new avenue that was n't there before . " but other companies have been pressured by privacy groups over the way they store customer data . @entity115 , for example , has come under fire in the past for the way it handles a massive database of user search data . but @entity2 does n't ban @entity115 . neither @entity31 nor @entity2 could be reached for comment tuesday , but there are a couple of important differences between @entity6 and @entity115 that may have @entity2 worried : for one , @entity6 can be used to write e-mails or text messages . so , in theory , @entity31 could be storing confidential @entity2 messages . former @entity31 employee explains ' upside - down ' logo another difference : after being dogged by privacy advocates , @entity115 now anonymizes search results -- making them difficult , if not impossible , to trace back to an individual user -- after nine months . maybe if @entity31 agreed to do something like that , @entity6 would be welcome over in @entity138 , @entity139 . subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity143 .	@entity3:Siri iPhone	@entity2:IBM	@entity0:WIRED magazine	@entity13:North Carolina	@entity6:Siri	@entity24:MIT	@entity23:Technology Review	@entity143:Wired.com	@entity82:Edward Wrenbeck	@entity22:Horan	@entity115:Google	@entity40:Dictation	@entity138:Armonk	@entity35:iPhone Software License Agreement	@entity69:User Data	@entity75:American Civil Liberties Union	@entity139:New York	@entity31:Apple	@entity73:Samsung	@entity12:Maiden

@placeholder billionaire owner of @entity15 considers ownership move to @entity20 jurisdiction	@entity20	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- pro basketball is a staple of @entity5 athletics , taking its place with @entity7 and the @entity8 as one of the pre-eminent @entity5 sports leagues . and it 's big business , too , pumping tens of millions of dollars into the @entity5 economy . so the owner of the @entity15 raised eyebrows this week when he said he planned to transfer ownership of the team to a company in @entity20 -- at a time when tension between the @entity5 and @entity20 is at its highest level since the end of the @entity25 . that raised two questions : will it happen ? does it matter ? the billionaire owner , @entity30 , monday reiterated his year - old intention to transfer the @entity15 ownership base to @entity20 , but has since toned down his rhetoric . " this is a long process which may or may not come to fruition and nothing is imminent , " @entity30 's company , @entity34 , which owns the @entity36 basketball team , said in a statement released via the @entity15 . " of course , no steps in this direction could or would be taken without the full knowledge and approval of the @entity36 . " on monday , the 48 year - old @entity20 national told reporters in @entity46 , " i have already stated that i will transfer the basketball club ( under the @entity20 jurisdiction ) , " according to @entity20 news agency @entity49 . not so fast , the @entity36 said , telling @entity1 the transfer has yet to begin .

" we have received no official application , nor is there a process under way through our office to transfer the ownership of the @entity15 to another company . " if an application to change ownership was submitted by the @entity15 , 75 % of @entity36 team owners -- or 23 of 30 -- would have to approve the move , @entity51 said . he said that the @entity36 's board of governors ( the 30 team owners ) would have to decide whether there are any issues with the transfer of ownership application . currently , the @entity36 has no rules prohibiting a foreign company from owning an @entity36 team . the back - and - forth comes as @entity20 president @entity76 pushes @entity20 businessmen to " de-offshore " companies owned abroad . last week , @entity76 stressed the importance of bringing the companies home and making them pay @entity20 taxes to help grow the economy , according to the @entity86 website . " entrepreneurs need to understand their responsibility , " @entity76 told a group of @entity20 businessmen last week . " our priority stance is that @entity20 companies have to be registered here , in their home country and have a transparent ownership structure . " @entity94 is described as a private investment holding company that owns or manages various metals companies , financial companies and media outlets , as well as the @entity15 , according to the site . in recent weeks , @entity100 has imposed sanctions on senior @entity20 officials and what officials called " cronies " of @entity76 , as well as a bank , after warning @entity76 against annexing @entity105 from @entity106 . president @entity109 also signed an executive order that authorizes his administration to target @entity20 companies vital to the economy , including financial services , energy , metals and mining . when asked about the idea of a basketball team transferring its ownership to be based in @entity20 , the @entity118 declined to comment . @entity122 says the discussions to move the @entity15 under @entity20 's jurisdiction began in the spring of 2013 . at the time , @entity30 intended to run for public office and the move was an attempt to comply with @entity20 laws regarding political candidates . " @entity30 was not in any way tying it to the current political situation , " @entity130 , director for international projects at the communications adviser group @entity132 , said this week . @entity30 called the move " an outstanding opportunity to use @entity36 technologies for the step - by - step development of basketball in @entity20 , " according to @entity49 . @entity140 , director of @entity20 research and emerging markets at @entity143 , a global political risk and consulting firm , said there is a basic agreement between @entity76 and oligarchs permitting them to make money as long as they stay out of government . they 're also expected to comply with government demands , he said . " @entity30 is falling into line with the @entity86 's broader emphasis on returning the assets of @entity20 's wealthiest businessmen back to @entity20 , " @entity140 said . " there 's a political dimension to that : to ensure that the wealthiest are as dependent on him as possible and as independent of the west as possible . " @entity20 's oligarchs always had to balance keeping assets at home versus abroad , @entity140 said , but pressure has been increasing . " for a long time the political risk of keeping assets in @entity20 appeared to be higher , but in the past month that has shifted because of pressure from both the @entity86 and the @entity171 , " @entity140 added . @entity172 , associate director of the @entity173 , said such a move in the sports world could be complicated by the current political situation . " any type of moves that take into consideration the residency of who owns the team would be impacted by whatever laws in the country in which they reside and any type of sanctions that currently or could potentially be placed on a country , such as @entity20 , " @entity172 said . if @entity36 team owners gather to discuss the transfer they have to consider the best interest of the league and owners , as well the ramifications of ownership change , he said . " anyone that has a background , like @entity30 , that could be aligned with sanctions , needs to be taken seriously , " @entity172 said . he added : " the @entity36 as a whole wants draw from a large audience . they want to focus on the talent and competition on the court , they do n't necessarily want to link up with geopolitical issues . " " unless the move raises issues with the league or the @entity5 government , @entity15 fans probably should n't be worried . as long as the @entity15 ownership group is financially sound and not running afoul of those groups , the team wo n't likely feel much of an impact , " @entity172 said . @entity30 became principal owner of the @entity15 in 2010 . he bought 80 % of the team , as well as a 45 % stake in the @entity216 , the iconic new facility the team has called home since 2012 . the @entity15 are worth $ 780 million , the 5th most valuable franchise in the @entity36 , according to @entity219 . @entity30 -- worth $ 10.4 billion , the 120th richest person in the world and the 11th richest in @entity20 , according to @entity219 -- gained his wealth through minerals and metal investments in the years after the fall of communism in the early 1990s . he 's got a reputation as a financial sage . " i like business , it 's my profession , " @entity30 told @entity1 's @entity228 in 2011 . " i spend , like , 15 hours a day in the office . it 's the great joy in my life , and i never think about money . " @entity30 has shown interest in politics in the past , and even ran for president in @entity20 as an independent against @entity76 in 2012 . at the time , some saw him as too close to the regime in power . many @entity241 suspected the @entity86 put @entity30 up to garner some legitimate votes without being a true threat to @entity76 , giving the impression that the contest was fair . @entity1 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .	@entity20:Russian	@entity106:Ukraine	@entity25:Cold War	@entity86:Kremlin	@entity130:Ellen Pinchuk	@entity132:Mikhailov & Partners	@entity171:White House	@entity216:Barclays Center	@entity0:New York	@entity7:Major League Baseball	@entity5:U.S.	@entity8:National Football League	@entity219:Forbes	@entity51:Bass	@entity173:USC Marshall Sports Business Institute	@entity76:Putin	@entity30:Prokhorov	@entity15:Nets	@entity118:State Department	@entity34:Onexim Sports and Entertainment	@entity36:NBA	@entity1:CNN	@entity100:Washington	@entity246:Leigh Remizowski	@entity172:Brunious	@entity105:Crimea	@entity241:Russians	@entity109:Obama	@entity94:Onexim Group	@entity122:Onexim	@entity249:Frederik Pleitgen	@entity248:Jillian Martin	@entity247:Quand Thomas	@entity140:Kliment	@entity143:Eurasia Group	@entity228:Matthew Chance	@entity46:Moscow	@entity49:ITAR-Tass
@placeholder 's mission in @entity94 is a litmus test for the future of @entity4 , say some experts	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the most important @entity4 summit in its 61 - year history -- according to @entity4 secretary general @entity6 -- began friday in @entity0 , @entity1 . @entity4 was founded by the @entity7 and 14 other nations after @entity9 but it has grown to 28 members , and is now seeking to shed its @entity12 identity by adopting a new " strategic concept , " framing new threats the alliance faces and the means to combat them . but getting 28 nations on the same page about how to address a range of new evolving threats will not be easy . the document to be considered this weekend is the product of a set of recommendations from a group of experts led by former @entity7 secretary of state @entity27 . the last strategic concept was drafted in 1999 . the new document reflects new realities for @entity4 and the world . the original @entity4 existed during the @entity12 for the collective defense of 15 nations against @entity35 aggression . @entity7 ambassador to @entity4 @entity37 likes to call that @entity4 1.0 . @entity4 2.0 marked the period between the end of the @entity12 and the present . this stretch saw @entity4 enter wars in @entity43 and @entity44 and embrace former @entity35 republics in @entity46 that were looking @entity47 . at @entity0 , @entity4 hopes to move into what @entity37 calls 3.0 status , meant for operating in a globalized world . @entity4 still has the core mandate to provide collective security for all its members , said @entity37 , but now must address new threats to @entity46 's security -- threats not as much from @entity56 , but from possible terrorist attacks , cyber attacks , attacks on energy infrastructure and piracy on the high seas . this new definition of what constitutes a threat calls into question the future of @entity68 of the @entity4 charter , which considers an attack on one member an attack on all . for an alliance whose mantra is " collective security , " the provision is the critical binding agent . @entity68 was invoked for the first time after september 11 , 2001 , when all @entity4 members agreed the attack was a visible threat to the security of the entire alliance . but the definition of what constitutes a threat to all @entity4 allies is becoming less recognizable , say some experts . @entity4 's makeover also expands its battlefield well beyond @entity46 . the mission in @entity94 is the largest and most recent example . but @entity4 is also providing support to efforts to combat piracy in the @entity99 and there is serious talk that the alliance could send forces to the @entity104 if the @entity105 and @entity106 ever reach a peace deal . the expansion of @entity4 's role into a global force , however , is somewhat at odds with the economic realities facing its members , more than half of which are cutting defense spending . @entity4 officials worry such a reluctance to invest in the alliance not only diminishes @entity46 's ability to contribute , it also increases the likelihood of the @entity7 going it alone . @entity120 , who served as @entity4 ambassador from 2008 - 2009 , said not all @entity4 members want to be the world 's policemen . " in some ways , the @entity7 and @entity46 are pulling in opposite directions , " @entity120 said . " the @entity7 sees problems and strategic issues outside the @entity4 area they want @entity4 to address and wants a more global @entity4 . but a lot of @entity46 countries still view @entity4 as about @entity46 and the @entity46 space . " at @entity0 , the @entity7 wants @entity4 leaders to agree to plans for a missile defense shield to defend against ballistic missiles . the @entity138 administration plan to deploy a long - range anti-missile defense system in @entity140 and the @entity141 angered @entity56 , which feared the goal was to undermine its nuclear deterrent . the @entity144 proposed by the @entity146 administration would deploy a continent - wide interceptor - missile system clearly aimed at defending against any missile threat posed by @entity150 . that 's more palatable to @entity56 , but @entity4 - member @entity152 , which could be one of the sites for the radar systems , does n't want to upset its growing ties with @entity150 . cooperation on missile defense is just one way @entity4 will seek to close the @entity161 chapter of its history . when @entity4 leaders meet this weekend with @entity56 president @entity164 , they plan to endorse a new @entity56 / @entity4 partnership to work on issues such as terrorism , @entity94 and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . since the late ' 80s @entity4 has struggled with how to transform its sometimes schizophrenic relationship with @entity56 , its former enemy . at times , @entity56 has played nice . it was instrumental in helping end the @entity43 war and even sent forces under @entity7 command . when the dust settled in @entity44 , @entity178 sent troops as part of @entity4 's @entity183 mission . but @entity56 troops still occupy @entity186 territory after clashes there in 2008 and @entity178 still maintains a sphere of influence over other countries in its neighborhood . the @entity35 may be no longer , but fear of the @entity56 bear still looms large in @entity46 members of @entity4 who want protection from a resurgent @entity56 . @entity4 officials acknowledge there are trust issues to overcome with @entity56 . still , they hope the substantial common interests @entity4 shares with @entity56 make cooperation possible . in @entity0 , @entity4 and @entity56 officials hope to release a joint assessment of threats and lay out their priorities for cooperation . still , @entity120 said , ambiguity in the relationship between @entity56 and @entity4 remains . " we never did a good job in making clear there is no reason why @entity56 could n't be a member of @entity4 , " said @entity120 . " if they really became a democracy and market economy , if they believe in freedom , rule of law and human rights , why the heck not ? " @entity4 's mission in @entity94 is a litmus test for the future of @entity4 , say some experts . the military campaign against the @entity225 has regained momentum and the summit is expected to announce plans for a transfer of control to @entity94 forces by the end of 2014 . but the ability of @entity4 to build the @entity94 government has proven less successful . while @entity4 forces are increasingly successful against the @entity225 , it remains very unclear whether @entity94 president @entity237 's government will be able to sustain the " holding and building " of the provinces once they are transferred . @entity4 's presence in @entity94 has lasted nine years . but while all @entity4 allies have contributed in @entity94 , their commitments are sometimes limited or inconsistent . even larger countries like @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 have caveats that their troops only serve in areas of limited combat . many others have withdrawn entirely in the face of public opposition . if @entity94 ends well , @entity4 allies in @entity46 may well consider future missions beyond its borders . if the mission fails , @entity46 could conclude the experiment was a mistake and stick closer to home and the @entity7 could conclude that @entity4 is not a reliable partner . the @entity265 panel warned early in its recommendations that " threats to the alliance come from the outside , but the organization 's vigor could be as easily sapped from within .

@entity0 spoke wednesday at the @placeholder conference	@entity28	@entity0 approaches self - improvement like a software engineer . every year , the @entity4 ceo sets some sort of challenge for himself . in 2010 , he tried to learn @entity7 . in 2009 , he vowed to wear a tie to work every day to show he was serious about @entity4 's growth ( and possibly get a break from the signature t - shirt and hoodie he wears to every public event ) . the annual challenges sometimes make headlines , most famously in 2011 when @entity0 vowed to eat animals only if he had killed them himself . that pronouncement led to a mixture of backlash and praise from animal - rights activists . this year , the famously introverted @entity0 is seeking out more conversations with actual humans . " this year , my challenge is to meet a new person outside of @entity4 every day , " he said wednesday at the @entity28 conference . according to @entity0 's own rules , he needs to have a face - to - face conversation with the person , not just shake hands or chat online . oh , this could be awkward . " hi ! i 'm @entity0 . i 'm a @entity35 . what do you love most about @entity4 ? " 10 fun facts about @entity4 's @entity0 but @entity0 said the challenges are a way to open himself up to new perspectives . " doing something for a year , i think you have all these interesting unintended consequences , " said @entity42 . the year of killing animals led @entity0 to become more vegetarian . while learning @entity7 , he had @entity7 - speaking @entity4 employees come to his office for conversation practice . he ended up learning about parts of the company he normally would n't have had interactions with and even had some realizations about himself . " i was complaining to my wife one day that i was never that good at listening in @entity7 and she goes , ' @entity0 , you 're not good at listening in @entity55 , either . ' " this year 's challenge has already led to one very noticeable outcome : the founding of @entity60 , a lobbying group started by @entity0 to advocate for immigration reform in the @entity62 . when planning his year of face - to - face chats , @entity0 said he joined community organizations and started teaching a class at a local middle school to have more opportunities to meet non-facebookers . while teaching the class , he asked about his students ' college plans and was shocked when one boy said he did n't know if he could go to college because he was undocumented . @entity0 believes immigration reform could also have a positive impact on tech companies hungry for talented programmers from other countries . the tech wunderkind said the annual challenges are also meant to test his willpower . " i think a lot of building something is just about kind of seeing things through . and so i try to pick things that are going to be hard for me to do , " he said . his goal for 2013 has been less challenging than he expected . as it turns out , the globetrotting head of a huge technology company meets a number of new people almost every day in the course of his job . " it 's actually turned out to be really easy , " @entity0 said . " i sandbagged this one . " @entity96 : @entity97 made @entity4 stronger , @entity0 says @entity98 and @entity4 ask for more @entity100 transparency	@entity0:Zuckerberg	@entity35:Taurus	@entity42:Zuckeberg	@entity4:Facebook	@entity28:TechCrunch Disrupt	@entity7:Mandarin	@entity100:NSA	@entity103:non-Facebook	@entity55:English	@entity98:Yahoo	@entity97:IPO	@entity96:CNNMoney	@entity62:United States	@entity60:Fwd.us

" [ more than 400 ] cooling centers will continue to remain open friday , " said @entity0 emergency management spokeswoman @entity32 . the city advised residents to turn on their air conditioners or to go to air - conditioned locations such as museums , malls and movie theaters to stay out of the sun. in @entity44 , 15 indoor public pools , outdoor wading pools and splash stations were available , said @entity45 , spokesman for @entity44 mayor @entity46 , in addition to air - conditioned community centers . " we actually were n't going to come out , because it was so hot today , but they turned on the sprinklers and we 're going to have some fun , " first - grade teacher @entity49 said in @entity51 's @entity50 . more than 700 sprinklers were available in parks across @entity0 , said @entity60 spokeswoman @entity59 .

@entity1 claims @entity4 in @placeholder	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 brushed aside @entity2 in straight sets sunday to claim the season - ending @entity4 in @entity5 . @entity1 has looked unbeatable from the moment she struck her first shot in anger at the @entity9 and so it proved again in the final as she triumphed 6 - 4 6 - 3 . @entity2 , who beat @entity12 in the semifinals , put up a brave fight , but was outgunned by the 31 - year - old @entity15 . the @entity17 @entity16 did not force a single break point as @entity1 again served superbly and came under constant pressure on her own delivery . a single break was enough for @entity1 to take the first set , finished with a flurry of aces as she served at 5 - 4 and an early break put her ahead in the second . @entity2 , who won the @entity27 to highlight her 2012 , bravely stayed in the contest by clinging on to her service , but at 3 - 5 down she cracked again . crunching ground strokes set up two championship points , finished with an explosive forehand as @entity1 claimed the @entity4 for the third time . @entity12 clinched the season - ending ranking by reaching the semifinals , but on current form @entity1 will return to the top of the rankings early in 2013 . " i made a little bit of a slow start to 2012 , " she told @entity39 after her @entity5 romp . " there 's always 2013 and i 'm looking forward to it , " she added ominously for the opponents at the elite end of the women 's game . since mid-summer she has claimed the @entity50 and @entity51 titles before coming out on top in the @entity4 's finale , despite having not played since her @entity55 triumph . with golds in the @entity60 singles and doubles , with sister @entity62 , at the @entity57 , it has proved a glorious finish to the year . meanwhile , @entity64 shocked @entity65 and home favorite @entity66 in the final of the @entity70 tournament in @entity71 . the @entity72 did not drop his service throughout the three - set match to deny the @entity75 maestro a sixth title at the hard court tournament . he emerged a 6 - 4 6 - 7 7 - 6 winner after two hours and 44 minutes to claim back to back titles after winning in @entity80 the previous week . @entity66 , under pressure from @entity82 for the top spot in the rankings , later withdrew from the @entity85 this week where he is defending champion to rest up ahead of the @entity87 in @entity88 . " i have some niggling stuff that i want to heal , i do n't want to take a chance for @entity88 , " he added . in 2011 @entity66 won in @entity71 , @entity91 and @entity88 in a superb end to the season . top seed @entity94 won the @entity97 title with a 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 4 victory over @entity99 of the @entity100 .	@entity27:French Open	@entity80:Vienna	@entity82:Novak Djokovic	@entity85:Paris Masters	@entity87:ATP Tour Finals	@entity88:London	@entity2:Maria Sharapova	@entity1:Serena Williams	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Istanbul	@entity4:WTA Championships	@entity9:Sinan Erdem Dome	@entity51:U.S. Open	@entity50:Wimbledon	@entity57:London Games	@entity55:Flushing Meadows	@entity75:Swiss	@entity71:Basel	@entity70:Basel ATP	@entity72:Argentine	@entity17:Russian	@entity16:World No.2	@entity15:American	@entity12:Azarenka	@entity39:Eurosport	@entity100:Ukraine	@entity99:Aleksandr Dolgopolov	@entity97:Valencia Open	@entity94:David Ferrer	@entity91:Paris	@entity66:Federer	@entity64:Juan Martin del Potro	@entity65:World No.1	@entity62:Venus	@entity60:Olympic
organizations like @placeholder and @entity186 are collaborating to monitor nature from space	@entity185	( @entity0 ) -- wildfires are fast - moving targets , so one of the most important weapons firefighting teams can have is timely , precise information about where the fire is , where it 's likely to spread and what 's in its path . in the past couple of years , firefighters have gained a significant advantage : aircraft equipped with heat - detecting infrared sensors and special communication equipment now can relay to firefighting teams on the ground , in minutes , a fire 's precise location , as well as where new " hotspots " are cropping up , even before they burst into visible flame . " when i was an incident commander , i would have killed for this kind of data , " said @entity24 , the director of public safety and homeland / national security for @entity28 , one of the world 's leading geographic information companies . in past decades he commanded operations to fight major wildfires , including the massive @entity36 wildfires of 1988 which scorched about 1.2 million acres . monitoring wildfires with infrared sensors from aircraft is n't new , but the level of detail and speed with which this data gets transmitted to firefighting teams has been revolutionized . " those aircraft used to have to fly at night , because you could n't gather good thermal data during daylight hours , " @entity24 said . " then you 'd have to wait for the plane to land , and then for the thermal imagery to be processed . if we were lucky , we 'd get that information on printed maps by 4 or 5 in the morning -- just maybe in time to brief firefighters before they went out on the line . " today those flights can happen in daylight with vastly improved accuracy , and incident commanders get that data electronically in two minutes on a computer - based map . we now have accurate , almost real - time situational awareness on the spot . that makes all the difference . " wildfires generally have a perimeter marked by an advancing line of flame . but burning debris gets sucked up into the column of hot air over the fire and deposited ahead of the fire line , often causing new spot fires where they land , up to half a mile away . these hotspots also can be caused by burning debris rolling downhill on a steep slope . left unchecked , new hotspots can smolder invisibly for hours or days . " incident commanders and emergency responders who are managing fires need to make decisions on where to focus air drops of fire retardants and other resources , " @entity24 said . " with this new hotspot information , all of a sudden i know : down there in that canyon , not visible yet , there 's a hotspot . so let 's divert some air assets to hold it while it 's still small and later deploy firefighters there . that 's so much better than discovering the hotspot only when it busts out of a canyon , when it 's strong and harder and more dangerous to fight . " how does this data get to firefighting operations so fast ? generally it 's transmitted over the @entity109 ( via broadband or wireless carrier networks ) on a secure website , which decision - makers and emergency responders can access via computers or smartphones . but where a direct connection to these conventional networks is n't available , that data can travel the " last mile " by packet radio , a technology long used by amateur radio operators . meanwhile , brand new technology is also having an impact on fighting wildfires . unmanned aircraft -- sometimes called " drones " -- also are starting to play a bigger role in fighting wildfires . according to @entity133 , as of june the @entity132 had authorized nearly 60 private and government entities to operate unmanned aircraft systems in domestic airspace for many purposes , including fighting wildfires . in the latest issue of @entity139 , @entity140 , a remote sensing specialist with the @entity142 , explained that in addition to carrying sensors , drones also can help form a data transmission network to quickly transmit thermal imagery and other information to firefighting operations . but so far , firefighting reconnaissance drones are n't commonplace . @entity24 said they 've been used mainly " when fires get politically visible . once a fire becomes catastrophic , they turn the drones loose to collect information and data . " that 's because it 's complicated to work drones into firefighting procedures , especially for managing aircraft and air space over fire areas . @entity24 explained , " when there 's a wildfire , emergency airspace gets declared . this restricts all aircraft near the incident . procedures for managing drones along with air tankers and other aircraft would have to be built into that protocol . i think in the future , if drones can be cost - effectively and safely applied , they 'll become very common and useful in fighting wildfires . but that 's a few years down the road . " satellites and even the @entity182 also help fight wildfires . in particular , satellites operated by @entity185 and the @entity186 can supply current data on wind direction and speed , as well as the dryness of surrounding areas . this can help predict where , and how fast , a fire will spread . an agreement signed in june will allow @entity185 and the @entity142 to collaborate on raising wildfire awareness . this partnership will highlight connections between wildfires , forest and plant growth research , and materials science . @entity140 noted in @entity139 : " this joint effort is enhanced by the personal interest of astronaut @entity204 , a flight engineer aboard the @entity182 . @entity205 is an avid outdoorsman who has focused much of his career on the environment . he selected @entity209 , the forest service 's mascot , as the zero - gravity indicator and talisman for his @entity215 flight to the orbiting laboratory in may . " @entity205 and his crewmates recorded high - resolution video and photographs of recent wildfires in @entity221 and @entity222 .

@placeholder hosts star - studded joint @entity53 / @entity9 tournament	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 won a battle of former @entity4 champions as she dispatched @entity6 's @entity5 in straight sets at the @entity9 tournament in @entity10 monday . @entity1 claimed her only grand slam win at @entity4 in 2008 and boosted her preparation for another tilt at the title in @entity15 later this month with a 6 - 4 6 - 3 victory . windy conditions at the @entity18 hindered both players during a 73 - minute match , but it was @entity22 's @entity1 who adapted the better . " it was hard to play , especially on the service because of the strong gusts of wind , " she told the official tournament website . " i 'm achieving a good level thanks to the work i 'm doing with my coach , " she added . @entity1 took all five of her break point opportunities against @entity5 , who succeeded her as @entity4 champion in 2009 . two breaks of service in the opener gave @entity1 the advantage and she broke through three more times in a second set , including to love in the final game as she wrapped up victory . she faces either @entity44 of @entity45 or @entity47 @entity46 in the second round and a potential last 16 clash against @entity6 star @entity50 awaits the 13th seed . the joint @entity53 / @entity9 tournament has attracted a stellar field , with the men 's event boasting the top four in the world , led by defending champion @entity59 . he beat the ' king of clay ' @entity61 in the 2011 final , but both exited early at last week 's @entity64 on the controversial blue surface . @entity66 took advantage to leapfrog @entity61 for second spot in the rankings with his 20th @entity71 title . but @entity61 told the official tournament website that this did not concern him . " to be number two or three is n't going to change my game . " i am here in @entity10 and it is one of my favorite tournaments . i am motivated to play my best , " he added . women 's world number one @entity81 will also be in action later in the week , coming off her final defeat in @entity64 to a rejuvenated @entity85 , who is also in the draw in @entity45 's premier tennis tournament .	@entity22:Serbia	@entity81:Victoria Azarenka	@entity85:Serena Williams	@entity1:Ana Ivanovic	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Russian	@entity5:Svetlana Kuznetsova	@entity4:French Open	@entity9:WTA	@entity53:ATP	@entity50:Maria Sharapova	@entity59:Novak Djokovic	@entity71:Masters Series	@entity15:Paris	@entity10:Rome	@entity18:Foro Italico	@entity91:No.1 Ivanovic	@entity44:Alberta Brianti	@entity45:Italy	@entity46:Silvia Soler	@entity47:Spaniard	@entity66:Roger Federer	@entity64:Madrid	@entity61:Nadal
the trial of @placeholder is expected to begin thursday	@entity13	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the wife of a former @entity4 leader will go on trial next week in the alleged killing of a @entity8 businessman , a friend of the suspect 's family said friday . the trial of @entity13 , the wife of disgraced former @entity15 member @entity14 , is expected to start thursday in the eastern city of @entity17 , according to the friend , who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter . @entity13 and a family aide were charged in the november death of @entity8 businessman @entity23 . if convicted , @entity13 could face the death penalty , but the friend said her life is expected to be spared . read more : @entity27 ' good ' for @entity28 , expert says each of the defendants will be allowed to have two relatives at the trial , which is expected to be speedy , according to the friend . @entity23 died in the southwestern metropolis of @entity35 , where @entity14 was the @entity4 chief and a rising star in the party -- the son of one of the " eight immortals " of the revolution that created modern @entity28 . @entity23 was found dead in his hotel room , and officials quickly blamed his death on excessive alcohol . his body was cremated without an autopsy . but controversy swirled in february , when @entity14 's longtime lieutenant , @entity48 , sought refuge at the @entity51 @entity50 in nearby @entity52 . @entity48 , the former police chief who managed @entity14 's anti-crime push , wanted political asylum , apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss . read more : the inside story of @entity28 's great political drama media reports and online posts claimed he clashed with @entity14 after suggesting that @entity23 had been poisoned amid a business dispute with @entity13 -- an allegation that appears in the charges announced . @entity13 and the family aide , @entity68 , were arrested in early april and have not seen their relatives since then , the friend said . the @entity72 news agency also announced in april that @entity14 had been stripped of his seats on the @entity4 's @entity74 for an unspecified " serious breach of regulations . " @entity48 was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization . authorities say @entity13 and her son squabbled with @entity23 over " economic interests , " and she regarded him as a threat to her son 's safety . @entity8 , which had asked @entity28 to investigate the matter further , said it welcomed the charges . read more : interest in @entity14 scandal bigger abroad than in @entity28 " the details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the @entity28 authorities , " a @entity91 spokesman said in a statement last week . " however , we are glad to see that the @entity28 authorities are continuing with the investigation . we are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely . " speculation has grown over the nature of @entity23 's work in @entity28 and his ties to @entity14 's family . @entity23 had lived in @entity28 for more than a decade and was married to a @entity28 woman . among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the @entity8 spy agency @entity111 . that link fueled rumors that he may have had connections to @entity8 intelligence services , but foreign secretary @entity116 denied that possibility in a public statement in april . read more : inside @entity28 's murder mystery hotel " mr. @entity23 was not an employee of the @entity8 government in any capacity , " he said in a letter . he said that the @entity8 government usually never confirms nor denies those accounts , but that he was making an exception , " given the intense interest in this case . " the case has forced the @entity4 leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high - ranking member in an unusually public way , according to @entity136 , a top @entity28 analyst at the @entity137 in @entity138 . " the disruption of his departure from office and his wife 's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people , " @entity136 said . that united front has been key to ruling @entity28 for 2,000 years , he said . the current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989 , when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in @entity0 's @entity156 . the leadership is trying to resolve the affair before its once - in - a - decade leadership transition at the @entity161 meeting this year , said @entity162 , an international relations professor at @entity163 and a longtime @entity28 watcher . @entity1 's @entity165 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Heywood	@entity27:Bo scandal	@entity28:China	@entity116:William Hague	@entity138:Washington	@entity111:MI6	@entity13:Gu	@entity137:Carnegie Endowment for International Peace	@entity136:Paal	@entity156:Tiananmen Square	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Beijing	@entity4:Communist Party	@entity8:British	@entity52:Chengdu	@entity51:U.S.	@entity50:Consulate	@entity74:Central Committee	@entity72:Xinhua	@entity17:Hefei	@entity15:Politburo	@entity14:Bo Xilai	@entity35:Chongqing	@entity91:Foreign Office	@entity162:Joseph Fewsmith	@entity163:Boston University	@entity161:Communist Party Congress	@entity165:Matt Smith	@entity68:Zhang Xiaojun	@entity48:Wang
he says it 's a good thing he will be tried in @placeholder , not sent to @entity30	@entity27	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the @entity2 's assistant director in charge , asserted thursday in a written statement that the recently arrested " @entity5 held a key position in @entity7 , comparable to a consigliere in a mob family . " this is overblown . though he was @entity11 's son - in - law , @entity5 is far from a big fish in @entity7 . @entity11 had quite a number of sons - in - law , having sired some two dozen children with five wives . on friday , @entity5 pleaded not guilty in federal court in downtown @entity18 to charges of conspiracy to kill @entity21 . but the significance of @entity5 's court appearance was not that he is a big player in @entity7 . it 's that the @entity26 administration has shipped him to @entity27 for trial rather than sending him to @entity30 to face a military commission , as has been the case with other members of @entity11 's inner circle . nothing in his past suggested @entity5 was suited to play any operational role within @entity7 . before he joined @entity7 a few months before 9/11 , @entity5 had been a high school teacher in his native @entity39 ; he did n't have any experience fighting in other holy wars as most of @entity7 's leaders had . @entity5 took on the role of spokesman of @entity7 at the time of the 9/11 attacks , but that did n't mean that he had any operational role in them or even knew they were going to happen . in a private @entity7 videotape that was discovered by @entity21 forces in @entity53 after the fall of the @entity55 , @entity11 is seen gesturing at @entity5 and observing that his spokesman was not clued in on the 9/11 plans . @entity5 appeared in another videotape that @entity7 publicly released a month after 9/11 , sitting next to his father - in - law as @entity11 gloated about the success of the attacks . around the same time , @entity5 also released a tape that publicly warned " muslims in the @entity21 and @entity64 ... not to travel by plane . we also advise them not to live in high - rise buildings and towers . " a year later , @entity5 fulminated " @entity7 has the right to kill four million @entity21 , including one million children , displace double that figure , and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands . " but these are the words of a blowhard , not a man of action -- something that is underlined in the indictment against @entity5 that was unsealed on thursday . it charges him with conspiring to help @entity7 by making speeches and persuading others to join the group but makes no allegations whatsoever of involvement in any actual terror plots . after the fall of the @entity55 in @entity53 in the winter of 2001 , @entity5 , along with much more serious players in @entity7 such as @entity90 , the military commander of the group , fled from @entity53 to @entity92 , where they remained under some form of house arrest for around a decade . @entity5 's decision to leave @entity92 to travel to @entity96 led to the chain of events that resulted in him being taken in to custody by @entity21 officials in the @entity101 and then transferred to @entity27 for trial there rather than incarceration at @entity30 , @entity104 . this is a sound decision for several reasons : first , the @entity26 administration 's stated goal is to close @entity30 , not to add prisoners there . second , the conviction rate since 9/11 in these kinds of terrorism cases is 100 % in @entity27 courts when it comes to allegations of any kind of involvement in @entity7 or its allied organizations . the @entity119 maintains a database of all the jihadist terrorism cases in the @entity21 since 9/11 . of the 39 cases in @entity123 since 9/11 , 20 defendants pleaded guilty and 15 were convicted , while four await trial . by contrast , the military commission system in @entity30 is largely untested . the operational commander of 9/11 , @entity129 , was arrested in @entity130 a decade ago but still has yet to face trial in @entity30 . it 's quite possible that the process may take many more years before his trial even begins . indeed , of the 779 prisoners who have been held at @entity30 , only six have been convicted according to a recently released study by the @entity139 , which performs research on behalf of members of @entity142 . in other words , while courts in @entity27 have convicted alleged terrorists at a 100 % rate , less than 1 % have been successfully tried at @entity30 . in addition , the few convictions in @entity30 have in some cases been overturned ; for instance , that of @entity150 , who was @entity11 's driver . in other cases , the sentences handed down have been very short compared with those in civilian trials of alleged terrorists in the @entity21 @entity159 , an @entity160 detainee at @entity30 , plea bargained his way out of the camp with time served and nine months in an @entity160 prison . perhaps because of his relatively minor role in @entity7 , the announcement that @entity5 will face trial in @entity18 has not produced so far any of the " not in my backyard " response we saw when the @entity26 administration announced in late 2009 that it was planning to put @entity129 on trial in @entity18 . the political storm this unleashed forced the @entity26 administration to backtrack and to announce two years later that @entity175 instead would be tried by a military tribunal at @entity30 . if @entity5 's case goes forward without a backlash in @entity27 and a conviction is secured , as seems all but certain , we can be sure that he will not be the last alleged member of @entity7 seized overseas who will be sent to the @entity181 to face trial -- rather than go before a military tribunal at @entity184 and all the uncertainties that such trials have hitherto encountered .	@entity21:U.S.	@entity26:Obama	@entity27:New York	@entity159:David Hicks	@entity139:Congressional Research Service	@entity150:Salim Hamden	@entity130:Pakistan	@entity119:New America Foundation	@entity2:FBI	@entity1:George Venizelos	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:al Qaeda	@entity5:Abu Ghaith	@entity123:New York State	@entity53:Afghanistan	@entity55:Taliban	@entity30:Guantanamo	@entity11:Osama	@entity39:Kuwait	@entity18:Manhattan	@entity101:Middle East	@entity104:Cuba	@entity129:Sheikh Mohammed	@entity96:Turkey	@entity200:Bergen	@entity92:Iran	@entity90:Saif al-Adel	@entity189:Peter Bergen	@entity160:Australian	@entity142:Congress	@entity181:Southern District of New York	@entity184:Guantanamo Bay	@entity175:Sheik Mohammed	@entity64:Britain
the @placeholder was personally endorsed by outgoing manager @entity9	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- not so much the @entity1 , more the @entity2 . from the get go , @entity4 struggled in getting to grips with the task of managing @entity8 and less than a year after succeeding the legendary @entity9 , the @entity3 has been sacked just 10 months into a six - year contract . it 's an old adage that @entity12 was n't built in a day -- but it did burn in seven nights . with that in mind , here are the big mistakes made by @entity4 during his turbulent @entity19 tenure with the club now left fighting all sorts of fires both off and on the pitch . @entity24 less the elephant in the room , more the uncomfortable , luxuriously - haired disaster in the @entity8 midfield . the @entity30 international followed @entity4 to @entity31 from @entity32 in september 2013 and he signaled the new manager 's first foray into the transfer market . it smacked of a toddler reaching for its comfort blanket . @entity24 's £ 27.5 million price tag always looked on the large side and it has only inflated with each of his underwhelming performances . the nadir of the 27 - year - old 's debut campaign at @entity19 arrived earlier this month , during an abject showing in a @entity49 tie against @entity50 . @entity52 newspaper as was so unimpressed with @entity24 's showing in the 1 - 1 draw that it refused to give him a mark in the player ratings section of its match report . with a new manager likely to arrive with fresh ideas , it could be a matter of time before @entity24 follows @entity4 out of the door . local laughing stock united fans hate losing to @entity66 . and they despise defeat to @entity68 . losing to one of those two teams is unacceptable , losing to both twice in the same season was previously unthinkable . somehow @entity4 ' team managed the unthinkable as the @entity3 presided over four defeats in four matches against @entity8 's two fiercest rivals , with an aggregate score of 11 - 1 . even worse , @entity68 , the club @entity9 successfully knocked off their " f * * * ing perch , " look set to win a first league title in 24 years , while @entity8 have failed to qualify for the @entity49 for the first time since 1995 . as for @entity66 , once referred to by @entity9 as @entity8 's " noisy neighbors , " the blue half of @entity31 is currently 17 points ahead of the red half after also winning the @entity86 final . last season @entity9 's team wrapped up a 20th league title for the club , finishing 11 points clear of @entity66 in second place . under @entity4 , @entity8 never looked like troubling the top of the table . so no surprise then that the joke doing the rounds on tuesday after @entity4 ' dismissal was that police had been called to @entity19 to stop @entity68 and @entity66 fans protesting over his sacking . tactics ? what tactics ? ! easy and straightforward to defend against . that was how @entity104 , who had lost eight of their previous 11 @entity108 games prior to a 2 - 2 draw against @entity8 in february , described the tactics employed by @entity4 . after the match , @entity8 were damned by statistics . @entity4 ' men flung 81 crosses into the @entity104 penalty area , evidence -- his critics suggested -- that the @entity8 manager was a tactical neanderthal . after watching @entity9 's team tear into the opposition for over two decades , fans found this " back to basics " brand of football hard to stomach . @entity4 ' reported focus on fitness and conditioning in training also backfired . rather than looking energetic on the pitch , @entity8 too often resembled the battery - powered bunny beaten to the line by its @entity135 - fueled rival . other brands of battery are available . so are other managers . problem players @entity4 inherited a squad which had just won the @entity108 title at a canter , but he struggled to get the best out of stars like @entity145 . tying @entity145 down to a new five - and - a - half year deal in february , rumored to be worth an eye - watering $ 500,000 per week , was seen as something of a coup by the club . but the truth is that @entity145 has rarely looked worthy of such a lavish investment . the 28 - year - old may have scored 15 @entity108 goals this season , but too often he has put in displays well below his dazzling best . the signing of @entity158 from @entity159 was supposed to add flair and purpose to @entity8 's attack , but the @entity163 has only shown flashes of his undoubted talent since arriving in january . people joked that giving @entity4 the present of @entity158 was like giving your granddad an @entity170 for @entity171 . @entity4 ' failure to coax the best out of these players , and gifted technicians like @entity176 , further contributed to his demise . small - club mentality " i did n't get the chance to say yes or no , " @entity4 said in july . " as you can imagine , the blood drained from my face . i was shocked . " he might sound like someone describing death by lethal injection , but this is the tale of how the @entity3 became @entity8 manager . " it was a strange situation , " he added . " i had no idea whatsoever until sir @entity9 gave me a call and asked me to come to his house . " i was expecting him to say , ' i 'm going to take one of your players ' or something else . i went in and the first thing he said to me was , ' i 'm retiring ' . " i said , ' when ? ' because he was never retiring , and he said , ' next week ! ' his next words were , ' you 're the next @entity8 manager ' .

@placeholder had made a bizarre outburst about an @entity4 detained in @entity5	@entity0	former @entity1 star @entity0 apologized thursday for his much - criticized outburst about an @entity4 citizen imprisoned in @entity5 , saying he was stressed out and had been drinking when he made the remarks on @entity7 . the family of that imprisoned @entity4 , @entity9 , said thursday that they accepted @entity0 's apology for his " outrageous " remarks but said they hope his comments " have not further endangered " @entity9 . the eccentric basketball veteran is in @entity5 for a controversial visit that has been rife with bizarre moments , including @entity0 's rendition of " @entity19 " to the country 's leader @entity20 at a packed sports stadium on wednesday . in an exclusive interview tuesday with @entity24 of @entity7 's " @entity25 , " @entity0 provoked outrage by appearing to suggest that @entity9 -- who has been held in @entity5 since 2012 -- may have done something to deserve his sentence of 15 years of hard labor . " i want to first apologize to @entity9 's family , " @entity0 , 52 , said thursday in a statement released by his publicist @entity31 . " i want to apologize to my teammates and my management team . i also want to apologize to @entity24 . " @entity9 's family had said they were shocked by @entity0 's comments about the captive @entity4 . " he was in a position to do some good and to help advocate for @entity9 , " @entity9 's sister , @entity38 , said tuesday . " he refused to do so . but then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against @entity9 . he clearly does n't know anything about @entity9 , about his case . and so we were appalled by that . " @entity0 attributed his outburst to stress . " i embarrassed a lot of people , " said @entity0 , who traveled to @entity5 with other former @entity1 players for a basketball game against a @entity5 team . " i 'm very sorry . at this point i should know better than to make political statements . i 'm truly sorry . " he said the day of the interview had been " very stressful . " " some of my teammates were leaving because of pressure from their families and business associates , " he said , adding that his dream of " basketball diplomacy was quickly falling apart . " " i had been drinking , " he said . " it 's not an excuse but by the time the interview happened , i was upset . i was overwhelmed . " in a written statement thursday afternoon , @entity66 said the @entity9 family would accept his apology . " as @entity0 has stated , being drunk and stressed is not an excuse for what he said , but we acknowledge he is human and we all do make mistakes , " the statement said . " our greatest concern remains the health and freedom of my brother @entity9 . we hope and pray that @entity0 's comments and ongoing antics have not further endangered my brother . @entity9 's health and freedom are precarious . " human rights criticism the @entity1 and the @entity4 government have said they have nothing to do with @entity0 's visit to @entity5 , his fourth in less than a year . the @entity92 online betting company that had backed the trip withdrew its name from the venture last month after @entity5 announced that @entity20 's once powerful uncle had been purged from his top government posts and executed . human rights activists have criticized @entity0 for his chummy relationship with @entity20 and apparent unwillingness to address the @entity5 regime 's widely reported abuses against its impoverished population . @entity0 befriended @entity20 , an avid basketball fan who inherited power from his father , during his first @entity5 visit last year and has described the young dictator as a " very good guy . " the two unlikely comrades appeared to be getting along famously at the basketball exhibition game wednesday for @entity20 's birthday . the young leader , whose exact age is unknown , is believed to be in his early 30s . " it was , as you might imagine , a bizarre and unusual occasion that wo n't easily be forgotten , " @entity114 , general manager of @entity115 , said in a @entity117 video posted after he accompanied @entity119 tourists to watch the event . birthday ball game accompanied by his wife , @entity20 emerged in the stadium in @entity127 to cheering crowds who for several minutes wished him a long life , stopping only when the leader hushed them . @entity0 gave an impromptu speech and then led the crowd in singing " @entity19 " to @entity20 . images released by @entity134 also showed @entity0 appearing to bow to @entity20 . @entity0 's squad and a @entity5 team played two games , @entity114 said . in the first contest , the @entity4 lost to a @entity5 squad , 47 - 39 . the second game pitted squads with @entity119 and @entity5 players on each team . " that game was actually much better ; there was a lot of showboating , showing off , alley - oops , slam - dunks and that sort of thing , " he said . @entity0 , who during his professional career set an @entity1 record for rebounds , did n't play the whole time , according to @entity157 , a tourist who said he had attended the unusual sporting event with @entity115 . after participating for about 15 minutes , @entity0 got changed and went to sit next to @entity20 in the audience , where the two spent the rest of the game smoking and laughing together , @entity157 said . " @entity20 really seemed to be enjoying himself , " said @entity157 , who arrived in @entity164 from @entity127 on thursday . next move uncertain the next phase of @entity0 's visit remained unclear thursday . @entity31 , the publicist , said he could n't disclose when @entity0 would return to the @entity4 . one of the other former @entity1 players involved in the game , @entity169 , flew to @entity164 on thursday , but there was no sign of @entity0 at the airport . " it was fun , a lot of fun , " @entity169 said of the @entity5 visit , before he was engulfed by a throng of journalists at the airport . @entity157 , who stayed in the same hotel in @entity127 as @entity0 's team , said he thought that the @entity4 basketball players remaining in @entity5 might be going skiing . @entity5 state - media recently published photos of @entity20 riding a ski - lift in a newly developed ski resort . outburst on @entity7 regardless of his next move , the shock waves from @entity0 's bizarre performance during his @entity7 interview on tuesday continue to reverberate . most striking were his comments on @entity9 , a @entity196 who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor last year on charges that he planned an operation to topple @entity5 's government through religious activities . the regime accused @entity9 of urging people to carry out " hostile acts " against the state . @entity9 's family members say he is a devout @entity208 who ran a legal tour operation in @entity5 but did n't fully understand the system there . his health has deteriorated during his detention and he was transferred to a hospital last year . the @entity4 government has repeatedly called on @entity5 to grant @entity9 amnesty and release him . but in his interview with @entity7 , @entity0 intimated that @entity9 might have done something wrong without specifying what . " do you understand what he did in this country ? " @entity0 asked @entity24 . " no , no , no , you tell me , you tell me . why is he held captive here in this country , why ? " " i would love to speak on this , " @entity0 said , before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to @entity5 for the exhibition game . @entity230 , a former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity231 who has visited @entity5 , said @entity0 had " crossed a line " in his comments about @entity9 . @entity234 , an @entity4 journalist who was imprisoned in @entity5 for several months in 2009 , said @entity0 's remarks were " incomprehensible .

new : former flight attendant @placeholder pleads guilty	@entity16	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a former @entity3 flight attendant -- who reportedly cursed a passenger over a plane 's public address system , deployed the plane 's emergency evacuation slide , and used it to dramatically exit a flight at @entity10 in august -- pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal mischief as part of a plea deal with prosecutors . @entity16 pleaded guilty to second - degree attempted criminal mischief , a felony , and fourth - degree attempted criminal mischief , a misdemeanor . under terms of the plea deal , he must enter a yearlong mental health program . during the program , he must take assigned medications and not get arrested . if he does not comply , he could receive between one and three years in jail . if he successfully completes the program , @entity28 can apply after one year to vacate the guilty plea to the felony charge and will receive a year of probation , according to terms of the plea deal . he must also pay $ 10,000 in restitution to @entity3 , the cost of repairing or replacing the chute . " i want to thank everyone for their support and kindness that got me through to this day , " @entity28 said after the hearing . " the public interest in this was surprising , unexpected and encouraging . at the end of the day , i am a grown adult and must accept responsibility for my actions . therefore , i am looking forward to moving forward with my life and i 'm very grateful to the court for making these arrangements which allow me to do so . " @entity3 suspended @entity28 immediately after the august 9 incident and he resigned from the airline last month . terms of the deal were announced and @entity28 entered the plea tuesday in @entity56 . @entity28 defense attorney @entity57 said last month he was negotiating a plea deal with @entity60 prosecutors . " we look forward to resolving this matter amicably with the district attorney , " @entity57 said . and @entity60 district attorney @entity64 had said his office is considering " an alternative sentencing program , at the defendant 's request . " @entity64 initially charged @entity28 with reckless endangerment , criminal mischief and criminal trespass , all of which could theoretically carry a seven - year sentence in prison . @entity28 at first pleaded not guilty . @entity28 's first court - appointed attorney had said a passenger hit @entity28 on the head with either the overhead bin or luggage , triggering his outburst . but some passengers who were on board the flight raised questions about that account . @entity28 's apparent " take this job and shove it " action generated hundreds of thousands of fans on the internet . @entity93 public relations veteran @entity92 agreed to represent @entity28 amid speculation the former flight attendant 's notoriety could lead to a television contract . " the court is the first issue , " @entity92 told @entity1 . " i want to resolve that and then we 'll deal with the rest .

@entity8 's lawyers argue @placeholder chose and controlled dr. @entity45 .	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- opening statements in the @entity4 wrongful death trial will be heard monday , april 29 , with the first testimony soon to follow , the judge announced tuesday . @entity4 's mother and three children are suing @entity8 , claiming the concert promoter was liable in the pop star 's june 25 , 2009 , death . jury selection concluded tuesday afternoon with selection of six alternates to back up the 12 jurors chosen monday . @entity4 lawyer @entity16 called it a " good , diverse " jury after the 12 main jurors were seated monday . the main jury panel includes six men and six women , and there are four male and two females alternates . the trial , which could last three or four months , is expected to include testimony from @entity30 and @entity29 , the singer 's two oldest children , and a list of celebrity witnesses . @entity4 died two weeks before his " @entity36 " comeback concerts , organized by @entity8 , were to have debuted in @entity37 in summer 2009 . lawyers for @entity4 's mother , @entity40 ; and children , @entity30 , @entity42 and @entity43 , argue that @entity8 is liable because the company hired and supervised dr. @entity45 , who used a surgical anesthetic in a fatal effort to treat the singer 's insomnia as he prepared for the comeback concerts . @entity45 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and is serving a prison sentence . @entity8 's lawyers argue that @entity4 chose and controlled @entity45 . the lawsuit seeks a judgment against @entity8 equal to the money @entity4 would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009 . if @entity8 is found liable , it could cost the company several billion dollars , according to estimates of @entity4 's income potential . @entity8 is a subsidiary of @entity8 , a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $ 8 billion asking price .	@entity16:Brian Panish	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:Jackson	@entity37:London	@entity30:Prince	@entity29:Paris Jackson	@entity36:This Is It	@entity45:Conrad Murray	@entity40:Katherine	@entity42:Paris	@entity43:Blanket	@entity8:AEG Live
@placeholder can got four points clear sunday	@entity17	( @entity2 ) @entity1 's chances of winning the @entity4 league where dealt a huge blow saturday as they were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity6 at the @entity7 . a mistake by @entity1 defender @entity9 in the eighth minute allowed @entity10 to fire @entity6 in to the lead , a lead they maintained relatively comfortably . the defeat left them in second place just a point behind behind @entity17 but with their @entity17 rivals still to play its one game in hand . much of the talk before this weekend 's round of fixtures surrounded the effectiveness of @entity25 versus @entity26 ; acronyms for the players that have been pivotal in attack for @entity1 and @entity17 this season . @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 for the former ; @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 for the latter . up until the start of the year , @entity17 's strike force had dominated . but since the start of 2015 @entity1 's new look triumvirate has thrived . @entity31 has scored 14 goals alone , two more than the entire @entity17 strike force , whilst @entity33 has bagged ten goals , and @entity32 four . but the three players were surprisingly subdued and had no answer to @entity6 's resolute defending . " we 're used to these kind of games . i 'd like it to be an accident but it is becoming habit , the opposition close up and we ca n't find a way through , " @entity1 boss @entity51 told @entity52 after the game . " these kind of results are sometimes a good reminder that other sides have their qualities . you could consider this a deserved defeat . " the result ended a superb run of form for @entity1 , who had won their last 11 matches in all competitions and scored 42 goals in the process . " they scored and shut up shop , " added a frustrated @entity74 . " they let us use the ball out wide and we tried , but the final ball was n't there and we did n't create clear cut chances .

" it was a physical game . great game . i was just trying to pace myself better , if i can say that , during the game , " the @entity19 told reporters . " or else i 'd be out of gas like i did in @entity12 , where in the second half i did n't have enough juice and my hamstring was kind of fatigued . in this game i was trying to take my time and it helped . " @entity28 @entity27 turned in his finest performance of the series so far , adding 24 points and 10 assists . the @entity1 opened up a 20 - point lead in the third quarter , with the crowd showing their appreciation with chants of " @entity38 " as @entity40 's team closed on a first @entity4 title since 2007 . " i was having a tough time scoring , and i needed to feel like the game was coming to me , and i was being able to attack the rim , get to the free - throw line , and make a couple of shots , " said @entity27 . " so it felt great when i heard that . to feel that i really helped the team to get that 20 - point lead , it was a much - needed moment in the series . so i 'm glad to see it happen . " for the @entity6 , @entity54 and @entity55 both scored 25 points as @entity6 continued a run which has seen the 2012 champions alternate between wins and losses over its last 12 playoff games . tuesday 's @entity62 will see the series return to @entity6 's @entity64 , which will also stage @entity65 if it is required .	@entity1:Spurs	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Game Five	@entity6:Heat	@entity4:NBA	@entity38:Ma-nu	@entity9:Tony Parker	@entity8:NBA Finals	@entity15:AT & T Center	@entity19:Frenchman	@entity40:Gregg Popovich	@entity55:Dwayne Wade	@entity54:LeBron James	@entity12:Game Four	@entity64:American Airlines Arena	@entity65:Game Seven	@entity62:Game Six	@entity28:Argentine	@entity27:Manu Ginobili
the defending champion beaten 6 - 2 6 - 2 by @placeholder 's @entity17	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- it was deja vu for the @entity4 sisters at the @entity5 -- but not in a good way . a mouthwatering third - round clash between seven - time grand slam champion @entity8 and 17 - time major winner @entity4 was ruled out when the former lost to unseeded @entity11 @entity10 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 in early play in @entity13 on wednesday . then hours later , @entity4 -- also the defending champion and world @entity15 -- fell to @entity18 's @entity17 6 - 2 6 - 2 , her worst ever grand slam performance . in 2008 , the siblings were also defeated on the same day at @entity5 , their least productive major . the last time it happened was at @entity23 in 2011 . an 18th grand slam singles crown for @entity4 would have tied her with legends @entity26 and @entity28 but the younger of the tennis playing sisters has now been upset in consecutive majors . @entity8 has been hindered by debilitating autoimmune disease @entity32 in recent years though she looked solid in her first round match against the promising @entity35 , @entity36 . the siblings join other big names who 've already been upset at the tournament , including @entity43 champions @entity41 and @entity44 , as well as @entity45 and @entity46 . defeat for @entity4 meant it was the first time in the @entity5 era that the top two women 's seeds had fallen before the third round . " i do n't think anything worked for me today , " a dejected @entity4 told reporters at her post-match press conference . " it was one of those days . you ca n't be on every day , and , gosh , i hate to be off during a grand slam but it happens . it 's not the end of the world . " i think she played really well and she played really smart . it 's great because i 'm going to go home and work five times as hard to make sure i never lose again . " i feel like i do n't have to win another match , i do n't have to win another tournament . everything and every day is a bonus for me . " obviously i want to do the best and i want to win and i want to be the best and that 's my whole goal . but it 's great sometimes to get knocked down because you have to get back up . i love getting back up . i love the challenge . " as for @entity17 , the 20 - year - old played with precision and power , securing the biggest victory of her career to date with barely a hint of nerves . " ( @entity4 ) said that if i continue playing like this , i can win the tournament . i said , ' i will try , i will try , ' " @entity17 explained of her chat with her opponent at the net upon victory . " i really did n't expect that but i 'm really happy . i had to be aggressive and i did it well . @entity4 is a great champion but today is a great day for me . " there were no such problems for the no. 3 seed from @entity92 , @entity93 , who beat @entity96 @entity95 . @entity97 -- the no. 7 seed from @entity99 -- disposed of @entity101 's @entity100 7 - 5 6 - 2 @entity102 , the eighth seed from @entity104 , edged past @entity106 @entity105 6 - 2 7 - 5 while the 2011 @entity110 champion @entity109 , from @entity111 , beat @entity108 's @entity107 . the no. 12 seed , @entity113 from @entity114 , was knocked out by @entity116 's @entity115 while there were also wins for @entity118 , the 18th seed from @entity120 , and @entity18 's 14th seed @entity121 . the top of the men 's draw did n't see any such turmoil , and two of the favorites enjoyed straight sets victories on wednesday . @entity130 , the no. 2 seed from @entity132 , breezed past @entity134 's @entity133 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 2 in just over 90 minutes . @entity130 is looking for his first @entity5 title and will now face @entity137 's @entity136 . @entity138 , the 2009 champion , was also in cruise control as he dispatched @entity141 's @entity140 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4 . the no. 4 seed will face @entity99 's @entity143 in round three . both players sympathized with @entity41 , the @entity43 champion who was knocked out in the opening round by @entity148 outsider @entity147 . " i understand what @entity41 is going through . in 2008 when i won my first grand slam , i know how that period went after that , " @entity130 told reporters . " it 's the first time that you have to encounter pressure or expectations of being a favorite in grand slams . " @entity138 also had some kind words for his compatriot , and said he was confident this would only prove a blip in his career . " with @entity41 , i understand where he is , because i was in such a position at a moment in my career , and it 's not even the pressure itself . i think it 's how you look at yourself and at your game , " the @entity35 told reporters .

@entity3 officials : @placeholder is refusing monitors from " @entity6 " countries	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- in yet another attempt to help stop the relentless bloodshed in @entity6 , a group of @entity3 monitors are on the ground to observe a so - called " cease - fire " that appears to be violated daily . while opposition activists have reported some improvements thanks to the monitors ' presence -- including a brief slowdown of shelling and the ability to retrieve bodies from streets without fear of government sniper attacks -- some say the mission will have little net effect , serving merely as proof that the international community is taking some sort of action . what exactly are the monitors supposed to do ? the @entity29 has authorized up to 300 unarmed military observers for a 90 - day mission in @entity6 . the monitors are tasked with observing a cease - fire that was supposed to go into effect april 12 , though both the @entity36 regime and opposition have reported at least hundreds of killings since then . the cease - fire is part of a six - point peace plan laid out by @entity3 - @entity41 special envoy @entity40 that was accepted by both the @entity36 government and opposition members . in addition , observers are tasked with supporting the implementation of @entity40 's peace plan , which also calls for access for humanitarian groups , the release of arbitrarily arrested detainees and the start of a political dialogue . who are these monitors ? the unarmed military monitors are soldiers trained in peacekeeping duties . they come from at least 11 different countries , including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 . the observers are selected based on availability from neighboring missions and recommendations by member states , said @entity76 , @entity40 's spokesman . what restrictions has the @entity36 government placed on the monitoring mission ? @entity3 officials say president @entity82 's regime has refused at least one @entity3 monitor because of his nationality and said it wo n't accept monitors from " @entity6 " countries -- precluding observers from many @entity89 countries who have been vocal on the @entity36 crisis . the @entity6 , which aims to find a solution to the @entity36 crisis , includes more than 60 countries and international bodies , including @entity96 , the @entity41 , the @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99 . in april , the group formally recognized the opposition @entity101 as a legitimate representative of the @entity36 people . the regime 's refusal to allow monitors from such countries is n't surprising , said @entity108 , associate professor at the @entity110 's @entity109 . " i understand their point . ... @entity82 is concerned with his own survival , " he said . @entity115 probably does not want to risk allowing monitors from countries that could be aligned with the opposition . he said the monitors could come from " impartial " countries , as " there are enough members states in the @entity3 that are not members of the @entity6 coalition . " @entity76 , @entity40 's spokesman , acknowledged @entity6 's demand might be a challenge . " that could be a problem , which we will deal with when it becomes one , " he said . what other challenges does the mission face ? opposition activists and world leaders have decried reports of retaliation attacks against residents who speak out to the @entity3 monitors . " we have credible reports that when ( monitors ) leave , exchanges start again , that these people who approach the observers may be approached by security forces or @entity36 army and harassed or , even worse , killed , " @entity76 told the @entity29 . in addition to the fear of speaking freely to the monitors , some say the observers are usually flanked by government forces -- preventing a fully objective , comprehensive view of the crisis . " if the @entity3 monitor mission is accompanied by military , then they 're not really monitoring the situation , " @entity153 said . can the observer mission bring peace to @entity6 ? even the head of the monitoring mission , maj. gen. @entity161 of @entity65 , said no number of monitors can stop the violence without a commitment to peace by all sides of the conflict . " ten unarmed observers , 30 unarmed observers , 300 unarmed observers , even 1,000 unarmed observers can not solve all the problems , " @entity161 told reporters after arriving in @entity6 in april . " so i call on everyone to help us and cooperate with us in this very challenging task ahead of us . " but @entity176 , a @entity36 - born scholar at the @entity177 in @entity178 , said the monitoring mission was " dead on arrival . " " no one expects the @entity82 regime to abide by the six - point plan of mr. @entity40 , " said @entity176 , who is also a member of the opposition @entity101 . " what can i say ? it has failed . the @entity82 regime has failed every principle . " @entity176 said the international community is clinging onto the peace plan to prove it is taking some sort of action , " to justify the lack of action it should take to save @entity36 lives . " since no diplomatic efforts have successfully stopped the violence , is it time for foreign military intervention ? " i think it was necessary some time ago , " @entity176 said . " in the absence of a greater force ... @entity82 is going to continue to slaughter his people until he wins . he will win when he subdues this uprising , when @entity36 will be too fearful to go out and demonstrate for their freedom and their dignity . " but unlike with @entity207 , @entity206 has shown no interest in launching a military mission in @entity6 . there are several possible reasons why the international community would be more hesitant to get involved militarily in @entity6 . in @entity207 , rebels had their own capital of sorts -- the opposition stronghold of @entity217 , where they operated out of a large base . but @entity36 rebels do n't have such a central operations center . in addition , the @entity36 army is much stronger and better equipped than the @entity207 army . and @entity6 is considerably more mountainous than @entity207 , which could make military operations more difficult . plus there 's worry over possible political fallout , @entity176 said . the @entity97 , for example , is in the middle of an election year . " all seem to be waiting for a @entity97 lead ... and as long as the @entity97 does not lead , no other countries " will initiate , @entity176 said . what other options does the international community have to help end the slaughter in @entity6 ? " if i were a diplomat , i 'd be less focused on sending 300 monitors and more focused on reaching a consensus with @entity66 and @entity68 , " @entity153 , the @entity110 professor , said . @entity66 and @entity68 are the only members of of the @entity29 that have repeatedly blocked attempts at formally condemning the @entity36 regime . both countries have said they want to focus on a @entity36 resolution based on political dialogue , but many analysts say @entity66 and @entity68 have ulterior motives . @entity6 is one of the largest recipients of @entity66 military equipment , @entity176 said , and @entity66 leases a naval facility at the @entity36 port of @entity251 , giving the @entity66 navy its only direct access to the @entity254 . but the interests are n't just financial or geographical . " @entity66 and @entity68 are both very fearful that the @entity29 interferes with internal affairs of states , " @entity176 said . " @entity66 has a problem with @entity259 , and @entity68 has a problem with @entity261 . " but both @entity66 and @entity68 support the @entity3 monitoring mission . and @entity6 's failure to maintain a cease - fire could cause enough frustration to shift the political landscape . " if any good news came out of this monitoring mission , it further exposed the @entity82 regime , " @entity176 said .

@entity177 : fight over @placeholder project is creating unnecessary collateral damage	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity2 pipeline has turned into a poster child for political posturing . while it is merely one of many pipelines crisscrossing @entity9 , this project has become " red meat " that both sides of the congressional aisle are using to weaken each other in an election season . to make matters more complicated , @entity17 public and private - sector officials have jumped into the fray by coming to town to extol the virtues of the pipeline . the battle has become so heated it 's easy to lose sight of the main question on which the fate of the pipeline should rest -- whether the project is in @entity9 's national interest and what are the measurable benefits and costs . the pipeline , as originally proposed , would bring crude oil from the tar sands of northern @entity17 through the @entity33 to the oil refineries in @entity35 and @entity36 , primarily for export . supporters tout that the project would bring much needed jobs . opponents warn of environmental risks . unfortunately , the fight over whether to greenlight @entity2 is creating collateral damage that vastly outweighs the marginal benefit either side will gain from sticking to its current position . three victims among many deserve special mention : the @entity51 transportation bill , @entity51 - @entity17 relations and @entity9 's strategic interests . the transportation bill , now in its ninth extension , is a critical piece of infrastructure legislation that consolidates more than 100 separate programs into just five major investment categories ( for efficiency ) and establishes performance standards for these investments ( no more " bridges to nowhere " ) . it is finally in the last stage of negotiations between the @entity67 and @entity68 . while the @entity68 passed a bill in march in a bipartisan 72 - 24 vote , the @entity67 has only a shell bill to offer , plus its " non-negotiable " insistence on mandatory approval of @entity2 . the @entity68 majority has its own bazooka : a presidential veto if @entity2 is in the bill . there is a good possibility that a sound , bipartisan bill authorizing a program so important to our future economic growth -- infrastructure -- will be tossed aside for a 10th extension and kicked into a new @entity86 to start all over from scratch . if this happens , both parties must stand to account in november for the damage done to our economy . @entity9 , which in 10 years has fallen from fifth to 23rd place in the quality of its infrastructure compared with its global competitors , will be the loser if the transportation bill becomes a victim of @entity2 . if the project ca n't be resolved soon , @entity51 - @entity17 relations could also be compromised . @entity17 is not only our largest trading partner but also a great friend . today , @entity17 supplies the largest share of @entity51 oil imports and buys our products with the money we pay them for it . yet the @entity17 government risks becoming a pawn in our domestic political catfight . @entity2 is being egged on by the fossil fuel lobbyists on both sides of the border who have urged @entity17 to double down against the initial permit denial and " turn up the political heat . " in a recent meeting with representatives of the @entity17 government , a @entity51 oil industry representative argued that @entity17 should have pulled its ambassador when the @entity2 permit was initially denied . that 's crazy talk . yet the @entity17 have pushed hard for @entity2 approval , bringing in both prime minister @entity127 and @entity129 premier @entity128 to praise the pipeline and hosting the @entity131 while in town to brief @entity86 on the merits of the pipeline . all the pressures aside , the @entity51 needs to pause and think carefully about its national interest . our future energy balance and supply chain should not be short - stopped by attaching @entity2 as a nongermane rider to a transportation bill for temporary political gain . politicians come and go ; nations generally do not . the long - term strategic interests of both @entity17 and the @entity51 are better served if all parties involved heed the analysis under way in the @entity149 rather than resort to legislative fiat or a presidential veto . calmer heads are already working on the details of a better proposal : a new route , improved technology and perhaps cleaner oil . the @entity17 government should vigorously and publicly embrace the existing @entity149 analysis and strongly oppose attaching @entity2 as a rider to the transportation bill . @entity17 should not be complicit in rushed , political decisions -- it should play by the rules . @entity86 should resist the temptation to use @entity2 as an opportunity for political brinkmanship . both democrats and @entity169 need to make sure that the real issues are n't lost in the partisan noise of @entity172 and that we do our best to avoid all the collateral damage . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .	@entity17:Canada	@entity2:Keystone XL	@entity33:Great Plains	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Texas	@entity68:Senate	@entity177:Burwell	@entity36:Louisiana	@entity67:House	@entity9:America	@entity169:Republicans	@entity149:State Department	@entity51:U.S.	@entity172:Washington	@entity128:Alison Redford	@entity86:Congress	@entity129:Alberta	@entity127:Stephen Harper	@entity131:Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers
the body of @placeholder , who died thursday , arrived early saturday from the @entity18	@entity3	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the funeral for @entity3 , @entity4 's former spy chief , took place amid tight security saturday , attended by several thousand mourners , politicians , religious scholars and military leaders . @entity3 succumbed thursday to complications from amyloidosis , a disease that affects multiple organs , including the heart and kidneys , according to the @entity17 in the @entity18 , where the 76 - year - old died . @entity3 's body , flown by private jet from the @entity18 , arrived at the vip terminal in the @entity23 at dawn saturday . several dozen supporters wearing black t - shirts waited outside the terminal carrying the @entity4 flag . they chanted slogans denouncing @entity30 and the @entity18 . the ceremony coincided with the second day of @entity32 . the military funeral began with prayers at the @entity36 mosque in @entity37 in eastern @entity0 . @entity3 's coffin , wrapped in the @entity4 flag , was borne on a horse - drawn carriage through the streets , accompanied by a marching band to the @entity42 . military police wearing red berets carried his coffin past screaming mourners carrying posters of @entity3 and chanting denouncements of the newly elected president , @entity49 , and the @entity50 . @entity49 spent six months behind bars during @entity3 's tenure as head of intelligence . @entity49 delegated his grand chamberlain and @entity56 . gen. @entity57 as his representatives . grand mufti @entity59 and a delegation from @entity61 , @entity4 's highest @entity63 institution , also were present , as were field marshal @entity64 , head of the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , and his chief of staff , @entity67 . @entity3 was briefly appointed vice president under president @entity69 during the uprising that toppled the longtime @entity4 leader last year . it was @entity3 who , in february 2011 , announced @entity69 's resignation and declared that @entity66 would run the country 's affairs . @entity3 's death came as a surprise to @entity4 . he had entered the race for @entity4 's first democratically elected president in the eleventh hour , but failed to gather enough signatures to be on the ballot . he was disqualified by a panel that included members connected with the @entity69 regime , suggesting the move was not politically motivated . @entity3 had headed @entity4 's intelligence since 1993 , maintained close ties with the @entity90 , and was often criticized by human rights groups for his heavy - handed approach with suspected militants . born into poverty in the town of @entity96 , he enrolled in @entity4 's prestigious military academy and was decorated for his performance in the wars against @entity30 in 1967 and 1973 . in june 1995 , both @entity3 and @entity69 survived an assassination attempt during an @entity102 summit in @entity103 , @entity104 . @entity3 was credited for saving @entity69 's life that day . a divisive figure in @entity69 's regime , during the revolution @entity3 led negotiations with various pro-change groups , including the @entity50 . his stance was mainly to end the " @entity114 " protest in @entity113 and create a " reform " package or else face a military coup . when asked by a @entity1 correspondent what he wanted from the protesters during the 18 - day uprising that toppled @entity69 , he replied , " go home .

@entity0 's former @entity4 correspondent @placeholder dies from cancer	@entity3	( @entity0 ) -- @entity0 colleagues have been paying tribute to the network 's former @entity4 correspondent @entity3 , who died thursday at age 65 after a long battle with cancer . @entity3 was a tireless reporter in a troubled part of the world . " @entity3 worked for @entity0 for 13 years from 1990 to 2003 during some of the most spectacular highs and lows of the @entity16 and was one of the network 's regular reporting faces from the region , " said @entity12 chief @entity11 . " he was a passionate journalist and a guiding force for many he worked with . " @entity3 was born in @entity22 and moved to @entity23 as a young man . he was a widely published print reporter who worked for the @entity25 and @entity26 before joining @entity0 as a field producer , then correspondent and deputy bureau chief . he led @entity0 's viewers through events ranging from the @entity33 accords between @entity23 and the @entity34 , to the assassination of @entity36 , @entity23 elections and the intifada . a portly man with a fuzzy white beard , @entity3 's gentle appearance and warm friendly manner gave no hint of his inner intensity . he was known to colleagues for his seven - day - a - week commitment to the story , his voluble personality and his insider 's knowledge of @entity16 events . " @entity3 was an expert on the @entity23 - @entity34 story , and managed to explain the complicated politics of the @entity16 on our air for so many years , " said @entity52 , @entity0 's senior vice president of international newsgathering . @entity0 anchor @entity57 , a former @entity58 correspondent well - traveled through the region in his own right , said he also benefited from @entity3 's experience . " @entity3 always went out of his way to help others understand the context of the story and shared his knowledge and his sources unselfishly . " @entity3 's encyclopedic knowledge of the region made him a favorite of @entity0 producers when news broke . as the network scrambled to figure out the story , @entity3 could vamp on air as long as needed . " if the producer said in his ear , ' keep going ' there would be a hint of a smile , and he would keep right on going , " said @entity0 senior editorial director @entity75 . even faithful viewers would probably be surprised to learn that @entity3 was devoted to cricket , his vegetarian diet and more profoundly , to his family . he is survived by his wife , son and four grandchildren .	@entity3:Jerrold Kessel	@entity16:Mideast	@entity33:Oslo	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:Israel Radio	@entity12:Jerusalem Bureau	@entity11:Kevin Flower	@entity4:Jerusalem	@entity25:Jerusalem Post	@entity23:Israeli	@entity22:South Africa	@entity36:Yitzhak Rabin	@entity52:Parisa Khosravi	@entity57:Jim Clancy	@entity75:Richard Griffiths	@entity58:Beirut	@entity34:Palestinian
@placeholder partners disagree on arming @entity9 rebels	@entity12	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- despite having @entity5 agents on the ground and @entity9 leader @entity8 's exit as stated policy , @entity3 officials continue to say the @entity12 - led military mission in @entity9 is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes . the seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the @entity18 administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a @entity21 resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . with the military mission shifting thursday to a new phase of full @entity12 control after initial @entity3 leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within @entity28 became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . president @entity18 continues to insist that arming the @entity9 rebels remained an option under consideration , while @entity12 secretary general @entity39 and @entity41 defense minister @entity40 ruled it out . at @entity44 and @entity45 committee hearings , @entity42 grilled defense secretary @entity46 and @entity48 chairman adm. @entity47 on the @entity3 role in @entity9 . " to say this is not about regime change is crazy , " said @entity50 rep. @entity50 of @entity51 . " of course this is about regime change . why not just be honest with the @entity3 people ? " @entity18 has said the motivation for launching military action on march 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by @entity9 military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of @entity62 . since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with @entity3 planes and missiles have taken out much of @entity8 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines . while @entity8 's forces have pulled back from @entity62 , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels . on thursday , @entity44 spokesman @entity77 noted the @entity3 turned over control of the @entity9 mission to @entity12 that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill @entity18 's pledge to the nation that @entity3 leadership would end within " days , not weeks . " while @entity77 said the @entity3 and its allies would keep up pressure on @entity8 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . regardless of when , he said , " the scope of the @entity3 involvement will be limited " and @entity18 continues to reject any possibility of sending in @entity3 ground troops . at the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the @entity5 to conduct operations supporting @entity3 policy in @entity9 . a presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include " advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . " top administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting @entity9 civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and @entity5 operations -- aimed at hastening @entity8 's departure . " does the @entity3 have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in @entity9 or another country ? it probably does . we probably do , " @entity77 told reporters . " is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of @entity9 's future , the future ... interests of the @entity3 and the region ? no. " @entity18 's dual - track policy , with the military coalition protecting @entity9 civilians while the @entity3 pursues " as a political , diplomatic and economic policy " the end of @entity8 's rule , is the best fit for the @entity9 situation , @entity77 insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a @entity21 resolution and @entity143 support . critics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . at a @entity153 hearing , rep. @entity149 , @entity151 - @entity150 , said the mission 's " military and political goals are not harmonized , " while @entity156 called it " just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in @entity3 military history . " on the @entity164 side , liberal rep. @entity161 of @entity162 challenged @entity18 's legal power to commit @entity3 forces to a combat role without congressional authorization . " this is a clear and arrogant violation of our @entity171 , " @entity161 declared on the @entity44 floor . " even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only @entity28 can declare a war . " sen. @entity177 of @entity178 , the unsuccessful @entity42 presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling @entity3 forces back to a supporting role under @entity12 control undermined the military mission at a key moment . " for the @entity3 to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the @entity8 regime , especially to those @entity9 officials whom we are trying to compel to break with @entity8 , " @entity177 said at a @entity184 hearing . " i need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , " @entity177 told @entity46 and @entity47 . " but in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of @entity8 leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal . " while @entity18 administration officials have described the continuing @entity3 role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- @entity46 said thursday that @entity3 strike aircraft such as @entity211 and ac - 130s could still be made available to @entity12 . however , he added that he believed @entity12 allies had the capacity to take out @entity9 ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations . appearing before both the @entity44 and @entity45 panels at separate hearings , @entity46 said the no - fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged " you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal .

@placeholder accused of public endangerment , harming the environment	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- the head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in @entity6 has been arrested , accused of public endangerment and harming the environment , authorities said monday . earlier , executive @entity9 had been questioned by authorities . @entity6 's prime minister , @entity10 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity11 that he favored strong government intervention against @entity9 's aluminum company , @entity13 " i proposed appointing a state commissioner to exercise control over the company who should manage the company and its assets until the tasks stemming from the disaster have been fulfilled , " he said . " i ask the parliament to accept the proposal . the company should be put under state control and its assets under state closure . " much of the red sludge has been removed or diluted in the town of @entity28 . residents watched monday as emergency workers and soldiers walked past in full biohazard suits . military trucks and cars used to decontaminate the area came through the streets , spraying away the dark red dust that accumulates . workers told @entity0 that they have been diluting the mud and removing it constantly . meanwhile , an eighth victim of the sludge has been found , said @entity43 , an official with @entity6 's emergency services department . " we have found a body near @entity47 that is likely to be the missing person , who would be the eighth victim , " she told @entity0 . " the identification process is ongoing , but we think this is the person who 's been missing . " five @entity50 experts are due to arrive in @entity6 on monday to find out how badly toxic sludge has damaged the environment and advise on decontamination , the @entity50 said . and @entity6 authorities continue frantically building dikes in case the dam holding the sludge breaks further , the government said monday . a " large section " of the dam is still showing signs of ruptures , the government said in a statement , meaning there is a " continuing risk of a possible spill . " the area has been evacuated , and soldiers were on standby sunday , an official said . the cracked wall is expected to collapse , @entity43 told @entity0 on sunday . " we know that it will happen , " she said , although when is unknown . about 800 people have been evacuated from the village of @entity47 , leaving it essentially empty , she said . hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses . a 50 - centimeter ( 19 - inch ) crack has developed in the wall of the aluminum plant reservoir . if the wall collapses , 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out . that 's about half the amount that spilled last monday , inundating @entity47 and two other villages . in addition to the eight people known to have been killed , more than 100 were injured . @entity6 's state - owned @entity94 news agency quoted @entity95 , state secretary of environment , as saying the damaged wall could not be saved . specialists had tried to reinforce the wall saturday . @entity10 , the prime minister , who was visiting the stricken area saturday , said it was " very likely " the reservoir wall will collapse . " it 's in very bad shape , and our estimation is that that wall could fall down , " @entity10 told reporters in the town of @entity105 . " one consequence is that human lives could be in danger . that 's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area , in order not to have more loss in human life . " the sludge from last monday 's spill reached @entity125 's mighty @entity124 river thursday , raising fears of wider contamination in @entity6 and countries downstream , including @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133 . but water test results released friday indicated the sludge may not harm the @entity124 after all . the ph , or acidity , level of the @entity124 water was 8.5 friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life , @entity43 said . readings of @entity136 range from 0 to 14 . levels lower than 7 characterize acids , and levels higher than 7 denote bases ; highly acidic or highly basic water can harm living things . the 8.5 ph level and fast - moving currents made officials optimistic that a natural disaster can be avoided , @entity43 said . however , on sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority , officials remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill and want to protect @entity125 's waterways . but , she said , it 's too soon to tell what those effects might be . " what happened on monday has never happened before in @entity125 , so we will see , " she said , " and we will try to avoid a bigger new catastrophe . " the environmental disaster occurred near @entity105 , nearly 100 miles west of @entity164 . the sludge covered the villages of @entity47 , @entity167 , and @entity168 , in some places reaching several feet high , leaving dead animals such as fish and frogs in its wake . the aluminum company , @entity13 , said in a statement saturday it was doing its utmost " to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit . " the company maintains it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations . the company was working to construct dams and defense lines in an attempt to minimize damage , it said . it has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for evacuated people . more than 1,100 residents of @entity105 and the surrounding towns are @entity13 employees , it said . @entity10 warned saturday of the " toughest possible consequences " for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause . " behind this tragedy , some human errors and mistakes must exist , " he said . " we will reveal all of that , and the consequences will be very serious -- as much as you can imagine . " the exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed , but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide , cadmium and chromium . emergency workers have been pouring plaster and fertilizers on the sludge in hopes that it will counter its alkalinity . dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat , @entity6 's @entity222 has said . it said some workers involved in damage cleanup may need filtering masks . @entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , and journalist @entity235 contributed to this report .	@entity28:Devecer	@entity136:pH	@entity131:Bulgaria	@entity130:Serbia	@entity133:Ukraine	@entity132:Romania	@entity232:Diana Magnay	@entity233:Brian Walker	@entity230:Antonia Mortensen	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Hungary	@entity234:Bharati Naik	@entity235:Flora Hevesi	@entity9:Zoltan Bakonyi	@entity50:European Union	@entity13:MAL	@entity11:MTV	@entity10:Orban	@entity231:Eileen Hsieh	@entity105:Ajka	@entity241:Official	@entity129:Croatia	@entity124:Danube	@entity125:Europe	@entity95:Zoltan Illes	@entity222:Interior Ministry	@entity167:Devecser	@entity164:Budapest	@entity168:Somlovasarhely	@entity47:Kolontar	@entity43:Tottos	@entity94:MTI

@placeholder oil production rose by 10 times since 2011 , more and and heavier trains needed	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- the tragedy of the train derailment in @entity3 , @entity4 , has brought home just how small our world has become . oil that was drilled in @entity11 's @entity10 oil fields is loaded onto rail cars and passes through a small @entity15 community and shatters their world in an instant . all my thoughts and best wishes go out to the families and emergency responders in the midst of this human and environmental catastrophe . everyone is touched by this man - made disaster -- 20 killed , 30 missing -- because so many communities have a rail line running right through the middle of town . here in @entity11 , like all over the @entity34 and @entity15 , towns grew up around the railroad lines . they brought people in to help settle the state and shipped the farm and manufacturing products to other parts of the world . but the increase in the amount of volatile crude oil being transported by rail from @entity11 's @entity10 fields has brought a new and troubling set of problems to the debate about our continued dependency on fossil fuels , and particularly oil , as an energy source . railroad engineers did not have transporting oil in mind when they laid out the routes . they did not avoid population centers , rivers , or environmentally sensitive areas . they were only concerned with getting from @entity64 in the most efficient manner possible . in fact , trains carrying oil tanker cars run just two blocks from my office , right through the heart of @entity73 , @entity11 . rail is the most efficient way to move freight , and @entity77 is a big fan of rail for transporting people and conventional freight . but moving extreme fossil fuels , like @entity10 or @entity84 tar sands , is a different story entirely . these fuels are " extreme " because they are more toxic and more carbon intensive than conventional oil . they are also more dangerous to transport than conventional sources of oil . production in the @entity10 fields has increased nearly 10 times since 2011 . to move all this crude , oil rail companies are running longer , heavier trains . and they are running them farther than ever before , bringing crude to refineries on the @entity102 and @entity104 coasts . the regulatory framework for train safety was n't designed for crude oil trains , and the rail and safety infrastructure is out of date and not up to the task . a state transportation safety spokesman in @entity113 this week said that the @entity115 disaster is " on the same parallel as a tractor - trailer accident . it 's private commerce and we do n't get involved . " this catastrophe proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that the transportation of @entity10 shale requires much more vigilant oversight . it 's too early to draw conclusions from the ongoing catastrophe in @entity3 , but there 's one simple lesson that we should not ignore . bakken shale , tar sands , and other extreme fossil fuels threaten our towns and our communities . we ca n't afford the additional cost , in safety or pollution that these fuels bring . and with growing efficiency and with renewable sources of energy , we do n't need them . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .	@entity3:Lac-Megantic	@entity15:Canada	@entity0:CNN	@entity34:U.S.	@entity11:N.D.	@entity10:Bakken	@entity104:Gulf	@entity4:Quebec	@entity102:East , West	@entity115:Lac-Magantic	@entity147:Schafer	@entity113:Maine	@entity84:Alberta	@entity64:Point A to Point B	@entity77:Sierra Club	@entity73:Bismarck
@entity10 , @placeholder top the latest list for countries where child labor is most prevalent	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- where in the world are children toiling dangerous and dirty conditions , missing out on education and other basic rights ? a new report by risk analysis firm @entity8 , which ranks 197 countries , identifies @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 as the 10 places where child labor is most prevalent . countries with high poverty rates fare badly in the index due to the need for children to supplement their family income , the report said , but economically important countries like @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 were also found to have extreme risks because child labor laws are often poorly enforced . trafficking of children into forced labor or sexual exploitation remains a big problem , the report added . despite its fast - growing economy , @entity28 has witnessed a substantial increase in child labor risks over the past year , ranking 20th compared with 53rd a year earlier . the report said that unofficial estimates suggested that 100,000 children are employed in the country 's manufacturing sector . @entity46 " the use of vocational work and study schemes , along with the continued use of children in factories , present significant supply chain risks to companies even in the more economically developed provinces , " the report said . last year , electronics supplier @entity56 admitted that interns as young as 14 worked at one of its @entity28 plants . however , the report pointed to minor improvements in the risk of child labor , with @entity64 now ranked as " high risk " rather than " extreme risk . " in september , the @entity67 estimated that the rate of five to 17 year olds engaged in child labor had decreased to 10.6 % in 2012 from 13.6 % in 2008 . the number of children involved in the worst forms of child labor has decreased to 85 million from 115 million during this time . the company compiles the ranking by evaluating the frequency and severity of reported child labor incidents , as well as tracking how governments prevent child labor and ensure perpetrators are held accountable . the index has been developed to help companies understand the risks of children being employed in their supply chains .	@entity17:Zimbabwe	@entity16:Pakistan	@entity15:Afghanistan	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:Myanmar	@entity12:Democratic Republic of Congo	@entity11:Somalia	@entity10:Eritrea	@entity28:China	@entity8:Maplecroft	@entity18:Yemen	@entity46:CNN Freedom Project	@entity14:Sudan	@entity56:Foxconn	@entity29:India	@entity67:International Labor Organization	@entity30:Russia	@entity31:Brazil	@entity64:South America
@placeholder : we need to understand the nature of intelligence and risk of false conclusions	@entity206	( @entity0 ) -- the intelligence community and the @entity3 administration have been under tremendous scrutiny since the attack on the @entity7 consulate in @entity8 and an investigation is under way . but some aspects of intelligence gathering and analysis are worth keeping in mind before drawing conclusions about whether this attack could have been thwarted or if its specific nature could have been publicized sooner . i should disclose my bias up front : i 'm a former @entity20 analyst , and believe there is an innate " inevitability of failure " in intelligence collection and analysis . this does n't mean we should n't hold agencies accountable if reasonable signs were missed in @entity7 , but assessments often take time , evolving as new information and evaluations of the credibility of conflicting reports emerge . instead of trying to turn the @entity7 attack -- and the deaths of @entity39 ambassador to @entity8 @entity40 and three other @entity39 -- into a partisan blame game , policymakers would be better served by thinking about how to enhance @entity39 intelligence capabilities . @entity43 writes in his seminal 1978 piece on intelligence failures , " analysis , @entity47 , and decision : why intelligence failures are inevitable , " that " intelligence failures are not only inevitable , they are natural . " in his 2002 piece , " @entity53 , " he notes that " even the best intelligence systems will have @entity56 failures . " @entity43 says so much information is being collected around the globe regarding so many potential targets , with so many enemy actors adopting deceptive tactics to mislead analysts , that uncovering every threat and thwarting every possible attack is virtually impossible . this overwhelming abundance of information , @entity43 says , may result in false alarms -- making it more difficult to discern if the threat of an upcoming attack is real . the global stream of information constantly includes vague information regarding security risks . the tragic events in @entity7 mark the first killing of a @entity39 ambassador since 1979 . but the rarity of this kind of terror attack actually demonstrates the overarching success of @entity39 intelligence agencies in keeping @entity39 safe . people have questioned why the administration did n't immediately report that the @entity7 attack was the work of terrorists . but we do n't know whether analysts had enough credible intelligence on hand at the time to be absolutely sure of the nature of the attack . reports indicate that the intelligence community 's evaluations evolved in the following days and weeks as information came in , and policymakers were briefed as assessments changed and solidified . this is common practice . it 's also important to keep in mind that the better a state 's intelligence capabilities , the more reports it collects , making assessments take longer as mountains of information are sifted through . these realities are significant as the intelligence community 's role in the @entity8 attack is examined under a political microscope . @entity115 e-mails sent about two hours after the attack and obtained by @entity0 show that an @entity118 group , @entity117 , had claimed responsibility for @entity7 on @entity120 and @entity121 , one of many channels of information intel analysts need to examine before reaching conclusions . the group denied responsibility the next day . claims such as these need to be corroborated . sometimes multiple groups claim responsibility after attacks ; obviously claims of responsibility are often false . it 's also possible that the attackers had ties to multiple groups , or had different motives . expecting policymakers to publicly examine and go through every conflicting piece of intelligence collected in the hours before and after an attack would be unreasonable and potentially even damaging to national security . instead of making political hay out of the circumstances surrounding @entity7 , we should be focusing on how to improve our intelligence collection and analysis capabilities . but we should also avoid overreacting with ill - considered major organizational overhauls in response to one particular attack . one improvement we could make right away is to invest in recruiting high caliber people to the intelligence community to create an analyst reserve corps . @entity43 has proposed this idea , and it merits renewed attention . such a team could comprise nonpartisan trained intelligence experts from various government agencies , academia and the private sector who would be mobilized when an incident happens . another idea would be to create the equivalent of an intelligence special forces team made up of individuals from inside the ranks or from outside professions . additional scholarships could be offered to recruit students from top colleges and graduate schools . we could also promote academic research into the realm of intelligence . there is a wide array of academic literature on military tactics and strategy , war , sanctions and negotiations , but little in the field of the role of intelligence in conflicts . in the final days leading up to the election , we must evaluate the performance of intelligence gathering in @entity7 in a fair and objective manner , with every effort to omit our biases and political views . the intelligence community prides itself on such objectivity in its work and in serving both @entity196 and @entity197 administrations . the public and policymakers should afford analysts the same courtesy by holding their judgments of the intelligence community to the same standard . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .	@entity3:Obama	@entity53:Fixing Intelligence	@entity20:CIA	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Benghazi	@entity39:Americans	@entity196:Democratic	@entity8:Libya	@entity117:Ansar al-Sharia	@entity197:Republican	@entity115:Government	@entity47:War	@entity40:Christopher Stevens	@entity56:BIG	@entity43:Betts	@entity118:Islamist	@entity206:Maller	@entity120:Facebook	@entity121:Twitter
@placeholder : " @entity299 occurs on the emotional , psychological , and spiritual levels "	@entity4	editor 's note : this is an excerpt from @entity4 's new book " @entity6 " published by @entity5 . @entity4 anchors " issues with @entity4 " on @entity8 nightly at 7 p.m. et. @entity4 writes about her journey from addiction and overconsumption to a simpler , honest life . this is the story of my ch . . . ch . . . changes , which took me from insanity to clarity , from egocentricity to altruism , from alcoholism to activism . these changes have marked an evolution in what i want from this life . i am what i want . what i seek to consume , possess , and achieve is a mirror that reflects my lusts and cravings , values and priorities , and moral boundaries or lack thereof . i am happy to say that what i want today is much less toxic and self - centered than what i used to want . it 's taken decades of self - examination to peel back the layers and figure out what really makes me happy . and while i 'm still searching for my ultimate bliss , i know for sure it 's not what i once thought it was . it 's not alcohol , cigarettes , money , food , sugar , or status symbols : i 've consumed all of those in massive quantities , and they 've just made me miserable . now , i want what ca n't be tasted , smoked , worn , seen , or counted . it 's the opposite of material . as sappy as it might sound , what i want is spiritual . watch @entity4 talk about her new book » the shift from material to spiritual is a particular challenge in our culture . we have allowed ourselves to be defined by our consumption , instead of by our ability to move beyond it . to keep consumers consuming , the corporate culture has brainwashed us into thinking we can change ourselves by changing what we buy , which pills we pop , what type of booze we swill , what gated community we join , what kind of golf clubs we swing , and what kind of cancer sticks we dangle between our lips . we 've been told that certain consumer choices say a lot about us , that they reveal our character . if we 've stepped up to a more prestigious brand , we 've changed for the better . nonsense ! we can not consume our way into personal growth . yet , millions of us have bought into this cynical concept of faux identity . if you keep buying the " latest and the greatest " but feel like you 're stuck in the same place , you 're just changing labels , and that 's not changing . that 's rearranging . real change occurs on the emotional , psychological , and spiritual levels , not in a shopping mall , a car dealership , online , at the drugstore , at the liquor store , or at the fast - food joint . for too long , we have allowed ourselves to be manipulated by forces whose sole purpose is profit and @entity104 . we have given advertisers leave to claim that inanimate objects have spiritual qualities . one ad , in perhaps the world 's most prestigious newspaper , urges us to buy an expensive diamond by insisting that such a purchase will feed the soul , lift the spirit , and increase our resolve to achieve whatever we wish . really ? how exactly does a diamond feed the soul ? it 's absurd ! this is false advertising . today , as a culture , we are awash in false advertising . as a society , we 've lent legitimacy to these patent lies by literally buying into them . as a result of this unnecessary , self - indulgent consumption , we 've gone a long way toward destroying our natural environment with our waste . perhaps most important , by obsessing about material things , we 've cheated ourselves out of the most fundamental aspect of the human experience : real experiences that result in real growth . unlike diamonds , meaningful experiences can actually feed the soul , resulting in self - development and self - knowledge . authentic change has allowed me to gradually learn why i 'm here experiencing this existence as well as what i am destined to contribute during my lifetime . for me , meaningful change has been about getting sober , becoming honest , and adopting a new attitude . sobriety has allowed me to shift the criteria i use for all the decisions i make from an ego - based formula of what 's in it for me to a more evolved formula based on compassion for other people , other living creatures , and our environment . it 's an ongoing struggle , and there are many times when i fail . but i keep trying . this book is my story of how i 've progressed from self - obsession to a life that i hope will count . in the tradition of the twelve steps created by @entity171 , i 'm going to lay out what it was like , what happened to change me , and what it 's like now . for thirty years as a television news reporter , i 've been recounting other people 's mostly sordid stories . frankly , the prospect of airing my own dirty laundry scares the wits out of me . the very thought of this sparks a flood of memories , primarily featuring the many stupid and embarrassing things i 've done over the years , especially before i got sober . my face burns at the prospect of sharing some of these memories with you . i know we 're all only as sick as our secrets . by pouring out the intimate details of my personal history , i am trying to get healthier through honesty . still , i ca n't help but wonder if you really have to know every single one of my secrets . is that what is meant by ­ rigorous honesty ? these thoughts swirl through my mind as i ­ huddle under my covers unable to sleep ... ... there 's so much to tell . but would you want to know everything about my personal struggles ? you may simply be reading this book because you 're interested in my life , and for that i thank you . but if you identify with my story , then we will both learn from my experience . that is the essence of all recovery programs . many of the battles i 'm fighting , the compulsions i 'm struggling to conquer , are the same as those experienced by many of my friends , relatives , co ­ workers , and neighbors . some struggle with overeating , with alcohol or drugs , with workaholism , with codependency , with compulsive spending , with gambling , with sex addiction , or with facing the truth about themselves -- whatever that truth may be . and virtually everyone i know , including myself , suffers from generic overconsumption -- a chronic craving for more of everything that is poisoning our lives , not to mention our oceans , skies , and forests . my friend once called himself a tornado of consumption . that description fits most @entity254 . sadly , we 're a nation of addicts . for a multitude of reasons -- our health , our finances , and our environment , among them -- we need to take immediate action to reduce our collective consumption levels . unfortunately , addicts do n't respond to reason or rationality . just as you ca n't reason with a drunk who is on a binge , we are not going to lecture our way out of @entity254 's consumption mess . fortunately , there are proven recovery methods out there that can help us get a handle on our addictive consumption . i 've used them to deal with my plethora of addictions , and i will share these techniques with you while i tell you my story . from @entity285 by @entity4 . available wherever books are sold . copyright © 2009 @entity4 . @entity288 .	@entity171:Alcoholics Anonymous	@entity6:iWant	@entity5:HCI Books	@entity4:Velez-Mitchell	@entity8:HLN	@entity104:POWER	@entity299:Change	@entity285:IWANT	@entity254:America	@entity288:All Rights Reserved

@entity4 leader @entity3 appointed as @placeholder prime minister	@entity6	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 leader @entity3 was appointed as @entity6 prime minister on tuesday following the resignation of @entity8 , whose @entity9 was defeated in thursday 's general election . @entity3 traveled to @entity11 where he was invited to form a government by @entity13 . so what will happen in the near future ? when does @entity3 take office ? @entity3 arrived at the prime minister 's official @entity18 residence early wednesday morning to begin work on agreeing the final details of his coalition government with the @entity23 . @entity8 left the building for the last time on tuesday evening . full election coverage how will the next government work ? the @entity4 won 306 seats in the election , which is 20 seats short of a parliamentary majority , so it needs the cooperation of other , smaller parties , especially on contentious legislation . on tuesday the center - right party agreed a deal to govern in coalition with the centrist @entity23 to form a " strong and stable " administration . this will give it a notional majority of 86 if all @entity4 and @entity41 vote with the government . who will be in the government ? @entity45 and other leading @entity23 look to be the big winners from the coalition deal with @entity45 appointed deputy prime minister , although it remains unclear exactly what brief that role will entail . the @entity23 are expected to hold five ministerial posts in the @entity53 . but the @entity4 hold on to two senior offices of state , with @entity56 named @entity57 , or finance minister , and @entity59 appointed foreign secretary . what is the agenda of the new government ? the government is expected to unveil an emergency budget within weeks as the @entity6 continues to recover from the economic crisis . @entity3 said reducing the huge budget deficit was his priority along with tackling the social problems that @entity6 faced . the @entity23 favored delaying public spending cuts while the economic recovery remained fragile . but both parties have been forced to compromise on key policies in reaching a deal to work together . the @entity4 have pledged £ 6 billion ( $ 9 billion ) in spending cuts this year . they will also scrap a planned increase in national insurance contributions -- a form of tax funding healthcare and welfare benefits -- paid by employers which they said would damage the economy . but the @entity23 have achieved a concession that will see the personal tax threshold raised to £ 10,000 ( $ 15,000 ) -- a key manifesto pledge they say will benefit lower - paid workers . @entity23 demands for electoral reform have been partially accommodated with the government pledging a referendum on moving to an " @entity94 " system . but the @entity23 have dropped for now their opposition to the replacement of the @entity6 's @entity98 independent nuclear deterrent . what are the potential stumbling blocks ? the conservatives and the @entity23 have very different policies on @entity103 , the @entity6 's nuclear deterrent , immigration and , crucially , electoral reform . will a coalition impede the workings of government and will it make it more difficult to get laws passed ? there is no reason why a coalition government should necessarily work any differently to one formed by a single party . the party leaders will need to agree on the government 's agenda , laid out in the @entity120 later this month . how effective the government is in passing new laws depends on lawmakers in both parties of course . if @entity23 are rebellious they will vote against the government , and if they bring it down , by forcing a no - confidence motion , they risk sparking another general election . is a second general election likely ? @entity3 has the right to call a new election at any time ; he may do so if he feels in a strong enough position and if he feels the @entity23 are not allowing him to pursue his agenda . who is the opposition ? the @entity9 is now in opposition along with other smaller parties , and its deputy leader @entity141 will be interim leader as well as leader of the opposition following @entity8 's resignation as @entity9 leader earlier in the week . do officials in @entity18 remain in their jobs ? members of the @entity148 are non-partisan , and work with a government formed by any party . the civil servants thus remain in their posts , and help with the transition of the new government . how often does @entity6 have coalition governments ? they are very rare in @entity6 politics . the last time @entity6 had a hung parliament was in february 1974 , when @entity160 's conservatives gained more votes but fewer seats in @entity163 than @entity9 . unable to form a deal with the @entity165 , the @entity4 stayed on in a minority government , but found themselves back at the polls by october . the last coalition to rule the @entity6 was formed in response to the crisis of @entity171 , with conservative @entity172 leading an all - party administration between 1940 and 1945 .	@entity23:Liberal Democrats	@entity3:Cameron	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:England	@entity0:London	@entity6:British	@entity4:Conservative Party	@entity9:Labour	@entity8:Brown	@entity53:Cabinet	@entity57:Chancellor of the Exchequer	@entity56:George Osborne	@entity59:William Hague	@entity171:World War II	@entity13:Queen Elizabeth	@entity11:Buckingham Palace	@entity18:Downing Street	@entity172:Winston Churchill	@entity98:Trident	@entity94:Alternative Vote	@entity120:Queen 's Speech	@entity163:Parliament	@entity160:Edward Heath	@entity141:Harriet Harman	@entity165:Liberal Party	@entity148:Civil Service	@entity45:Nick Clegg	@entity103:Europe	@entity41:Lib Dem MPs
source : if budding stars @placeholder and @entity56 ca n't deliver ratings , there 's a problem	@entity54	( @entity0 ) -- a tv series ' 100th episode signifies success and , in most cases , a profitable afterlife in syndication . shows like " @entity8 " and " friends " coasted past their centenary episodes , leaving fans wanting more . but it 's not just ratings juggernauts that reach the milestone . sometimes networks and viewers just do n't know when to let go . " @entity23 's " climactic 100th episode aired on monday , reminding dedicated fans why they 've held on for so long , and , by the same token , alerting former viewers of the show 's protracted life . " they can trot out a cake with 100 candles on it , but let 's be honest , ( ' @entity23 's ' ) ratings have been terrible for years , " said @entity24 , the features editor at @entity25 . the @entity33 drama has n't attracted more than 1.5 million viewers during its monday night timeslot since the fifth season kicked off in september . during its first season , which premiered in 2007 , episodes of " @entity23 " routinely garnered more than 2 million viewers -- a feat for the younger - skewing network . and despite disappointing ratings , " @entity23 " executive producer @entity43 told @entity45 that they 're not writing a series finale anytime soon . " the actors ' contracts expire at the end of next season , so that feels like probably an organic ending point , " @entity43 said . if budding movie stars @entity54 and @entity56 ca n't deliver ratings , there 's a problem , @entity24 said . perhaps it 's because the series , based on @entity62 's novels of the same name , is n't playing hard to get . " @entity23 " does n't need 24 episodes each season , @entity24 said . networks can learn from the model employed by @entity69 's " @entity68 " and @entity71 's " @entity70 , " he added . they need to minimize the number of episodes airing each season . " some shows only need to last three seasons , " he said . " and some shows only need to have 10 episodes per season . users can handle that , but the networks ca n't . " the show 's creator , @entity83 , has taken heat for this in the past . his @entity89 drama " @entity90 " lasted four seasons -- just short of the 100 - episode mark -- before getting canceled in 2007 . many viewers have argued that " the @entity90 's " jumping point occurred when @entity96 's character was killed off at the end of season 3 . of course , it 's easy for a high quality show that 's won a ton of awards , like " @entity103 , " to go out on top , @entity24 said , adding , " other shows on network tv will try and wring out every dollar ... they possibly can . it 's always happened that way . " take , for example , @entity112 's " @entity111 " and " @entity113 " on @entity89 , he said . at one point , both shows dominated ratings and awards shows . now , with both programs currently in the midst of their eighth seasons , viewership has greatly diminished . after hitting a ratings rough patch last season , @entity112 's " @entity126 , " on the other hand , is currently experiencing a resurgence in its eighth season . many primetime soaps experience hills and valleys , @entity24 said . unfortunately for " @entity23 , " the next hill might be out of reach . " to wait five seasons before marrying @entity134 off and announcing who @entity23 is , you 've missed the boat , " he said . " they were starting to throw in these gimmicks too late in the game . " but the @entity33 , @entity83 and @entity43 have another trick up their sleeves . they 're working to bring " @entity144 " prequel " the @entity145 " to the small screen . @entity24 says only the really great shows will make it to syndication and last there . " @entity150 " and " @entity151 : @entity154 , " he said , " will forever be in syndication because people still tune into them . " a show like " @entity23 , " he added -- not so much . " there are too many options on tv . ... and with people flipping around the @entity160 ... ratings have been dropping across the board , " he said .

@placeholder and his regime " have no future , " the @entity4 secretary - general says	@entity9	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- new @entity4 airstrikes shook @entity0 into early tuesday after the alliance 's secretary - general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime @entity10 strongman @entity9 had fallen into a stalemate . at least three rounds of explosions echoed across the @entity10 capital in a three - hour span that began late monday , and the roar of jets could be heard overhead . @entity19 spokesman @entity18 told @entity2 that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central @entity0 , and that a nearby hospital was " indirectly " affected . " @entity23 was an exceptional night in @entity0 , " @entity18 said , noting that the strikes followed " an extended period of calm . " " it is very sad , " he said . " we are losing people every day on both sides . we think it is time to sit down and talk . " @entity4 warplanes and missiles have been pounding @entity9 's forces and government installations since march 31 as @entity9 attempts to put down a nearly three - month - old revolt against his rule . secretary - general @entity38 told @entity2 on monday that @entity9 and his regime " have no future , " but refused to predict how long the @entity10 leader could hold on . @entity38 denied that the situation in @entity1 had devolved into a " stalemate , " insisting that @entity4 was " making progress " and had " taken out " a substantial part of @entity9 's military capability . he said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end , but " it 's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as @entity9 remains in power . " despite the ongoing bombardment , @entity9 's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of @entity61 , survivors there have told @entity2 . @entity61 is the only city in western @entity1 held by the rebels , and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones , burns and amputations . " they are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . it has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of @entity61 , " said @entity70 , a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to @entity72 . @entity77 , a spokesman for the rebels , said fighters attacked @entity9 's forces about 22 kilometers ( 14 miles ) from @entity0 , killing 12 and hitting a tank . the situation in @entity61 " is at the forefront " of @entity84 concerns about @entity1 's civilian population , @entity85 , the @entity84 undersecretary - general for humanitarian affairs , told the @entity87 on monday . two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city 's port has prevented aid ships from docking there , and between 150 and 300 non-libyans are still waiting to be evacuated , she said . " some people are running short of food , water and other basics , " she said . " medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel . " the @entity87 voted in march to authorize the use of force to protect @entity10 civilians from @entity9 's regime . nearly 750,000 people have fled the country , another 58,000 are displaced within @entity1 and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into @entity1 , @entity111 and @entity112 , @entity107 said . for those who remain , @entity107 said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on @entity9 and his allies have caused " a severe disruption of supply lines within the country . " the results have been " shortages of fuel , difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs , medicines and other essential goods , and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country . " @entity1 has about three months ' supply of food remaining ; the mostly rebel - held east has about two months , she said . fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many @entity10 " are running out , " she added . there have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and @entity145 forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . as time wears on , though , human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged @entity10 in @entity61 . the wounded arriving in @entity72 , the rebel hub city , painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in @entity61 . @entity152 , who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the @entity155 , was wounded when a missile struck near her home . " i was in my house praying when the first missile landed . shortly after , more missiles , one after another started hitting our neighborhood , " said @entity160 , who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds . " @entity167 . fear . people are scared every moment of the day no matter their age , " she said . " oh @entity173 , it 's like a horror movie . " @entity175 , who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds , said he does not regret fighting . " the price for freedom is high and it ( is ) necessary to be liberated from this regime , " he said . @entity182 has said @entity9 's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes . a report issued last week by the monitoring group accused @entity189 forces of the " unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks , including use of heavy artillery , rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents . " " i 'm not going to guess about a timeline . i want a solution sooner rather than later , " @entity38 said . @entity2 's @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Tonight	@entity84:U.N.	@entity85:Valerie Amos	@entity111:Tunisia	@entity87:Security Council	@entity112:Niger	@entity152:Hanan Muhammad	@entity155:International Organization for Migration	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Libya	@entity0:Tripoli	@entity175:Al-Neairy	@entity4:NATO	@entity9:Gadhafi	@entity77:Mostafa Bozen	@entity70:Ibrahim al-Neairy	@entity72:Benghazi	@entity10:Libyans	@entity38:Rasmussen	@entity173:God	@entity19:Government	@entity18:Ibrahim	@entity107:Amos	@entity203:Sara Sidner	@entity202:Jomana Karadsheh	@entity145:anti-Gadhafi	@entity204:Amir Ahmed	@entity189:pro-Gadhafi	@entity160:Muhammad	@entity167:Terror	@entity182:Amnesty International	@entity61:Misrata
@entity119 is stuffed with vitamins a , @placeholder , @entity12 , @entity13 , as well as other nutrients	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- even if you 're not a fan of broccoli , your joints may be . nutritionists have rhapsodized about the various benefits of broccoli â € ” the cruciferous vegetable is stuffed with vitamins a , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , as well as nutrients such as potassium , zinc and fiber â € ” and arthritis sufferers may soon join them . along with its cousins brussel sprouts , cauliflower and cabbage , broccoli contains sulfur compounds that can filter out carcinogens that promote tumor growth . the latest study , published in the journal @entity30 , shows that those substances may also battle inflammation , which is at the root of osteoarthritis , a painful , degenerative joint disease in which cartilage that normally protects joints starts to wear away under the influence of the inflammatory factors . for the estimated 12.4 million people affected by arthritis in the @entity44 , these results are certainly welcome news . @entity0 : acupuncture may offer real relief for chronic pain starting with studies in mice , the researchers found that animals that ate a diet high in the sulforaphane found in broccoli had significantly less cartilage damage and signs of osteoarthritis compared to mice who did not consume sulforaphane . the team then moved to human and cow cartilage cells , and found that the sulforaphane was equally effective in protecting these cells from damage . the sulfur - based compound , they say , may be blocking enzymes that contribute to inflammation in cartilage , and the scientists are starting a trial to see if broccoli can protect a small group of arthritis patients getting knee replacement surgery . if that trial confirms these early results , that could help more people to avoid arthritis to begin with ; although surgery can treat symptoms , protecting joints from irreversible damage would keep joints stronger for a longer period of time . " although surgery is very successful , it is not really an answer . once you have osteoarthritis , being able to slow its progress and the progression to surgery is really important , study author @entity92 , professor of musculoskeletal biology at the @entity93 said in a statement .

@entity1 and former " 90210 " co-star @placeholder are developing a tv series together	@entity127	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 is not ashamed to admit she gets hooked on " @entity2 , 90210 " reruns on @entity4 from time to time . " sometimes i 'll be walking through a room , and i 'll see that it 's on , and i have to stop and pay my respects and watch it , " she said . " then i get sucked in . just seeing the clothes and the makeup was so distinct to that era , you know ? it 's really fun to watch now . you can play drinking games to it , too , which is always a good time . " while in @entity18 promoting @entity19 's give one program benefitting @entity21 , the actress spoke to @entity0 about re-entering the dating scene , her former co-star @entity23 and the role that launched her career : @entity26 on " @entity2 , 90210 . " over the course of the original " 90210 's " 1990 - 2000 run , @entity26 was shot , raped , kidnapped , addicted to cocaine , joined a cult and almost died in a fire . while @entity32 never got top billing , @entity26 was arguably the series ' star , looking back on " 90210 's " decade - long run . in fact , @entity32 pointed out that the only episode that did n't prominently feature her character was the one where the gang went to @entity42 ( because that 's what you do when you 're unemployed and just out of college ) . " this is the ultimate sacrifice for being a mother , " said @entity32 . " the ultimate ' f --- you , ' basically , from my show . i had a baby ; they went to @entity42 . i did n't get to go because i had had a baby . " @entity32 's character , @entity26 , did get shot at the very end of that episode . " yeah i got shot , but really i was having a baby , " said @entity32 . " very symbolic . become a mother , get shot . become a mother , do n't get to go on anymore vacations . " the conversation quickly turned into a retrospective about the disasters @entity26 endured during her " 90210 " tenure . the fire : " i had to wear that stupid scar makeup for months . " @entity26 's fellow burn victim : " the lesbian stalker , one of my favorites ! " drug addiction : " the coke days ! those were fun episodes . the dark eye makeup , black nails , i really went for it . edgy . " 2013 will mark the 20 - year high school reunion of the fictional @entity78 of ' 93 , and @entity32 is n't opposed to a potential reunion special . " i 've never been to a real reunion because i did n't graduate from a real high school so that would be pretty cool , " she said . @entity32 was hard - pressed to come up with any on - set " 90210 " secrets that the fans do n't already know , but she did come up with something rather shudder - worthy . " there was a vending machine at the @entity88 that had nuts and candy , " said @entity32 . " you know those ones where you put your quarter in and out comes a handful ? it was maggots . there were actual maggots crawling inside it . it was so disgusting . " another interesting fun fact : the house where the fire episode took place was the same house used for the exteriors of the @entity109 family house in " @entity110 " and the @entity112 family house in " @entity113 . " that house sits on the @entity115 lot in @entity116 , @entity117 , and its windows and trimmings are often altered to suit filming . @entity32 , who turned 40 earlier this year , remains friends with her " @entity2 , 90210 " co-stars -- yes , even @entity124 . she also still sees @entity125 and @entity126 , but remains closest with @entity127 . " @entity127 and i are actually doing a show , " she said . " we love working together so when we did that ( @entity131 ) commercial , he and i , specifically , have a very strong connection so we were like ' let 's make a show together . let 's work everyday with people we actually love . ' so we 're working on something now . " details about the still - in - development show remain under wraps , but @entity32 and @entity127 are developing , creating and producing it . @entity32 , who starred alongside @entity23 on the sitcom " @entity143 " from 2002 - 2006 , has not spoken to @entity23 since the young actress ' legal woes began mounting this year . " i 'll always have a special place for her in my heart , " said @entity32 . " you ca n't play sisters with somebody for four years and not love them and take them under your wing . " @entity32 and her husband , actor @entity153 , split earlier this year after 11 years of marriage . @entity153 is now romantically linked to actress @entity156 , his co-star on @entity158 's " @entity157 . " @entity32 and @entity153 share joint custody of their three daughters -- @entity164 , 15 , @entity165 , 10 , and @entity166 , 6 -- whom they remain utterly devoted to . " i have the girls for christmas day , and we 're gon na have a traditional @entity169 , " said @entity32 , " then we 're traveling to see some friends in @entity171 and then their dad 's going to be taking them for a few days to go skiing or something . it 's all new , this splitting of the holidays . it 's definitely new . definitely new and foreign ; but i 'm jumping in with both feet , and i 'm going to make it the best holiday for my girls that i possibly can . " for all the " twilight " fans wondering whether @entity32 has seen @entity153 's latest movie , " @entity182 " : " i have n't , " she said . " my girls are all fans , and i support them loving it and loving the movie that their dad 's in but , no , i have n't seen the new one . " @entity32 also admitted she hates being back on the dating scene . " who wants to date , " she said . " it 's awful , and then add to it being photographed while doing it , and the scrutiny that that entails . it 's impossible . " @entity32 also took the opportunity to clear up rumors that she likes mean guys . " it went viral that i like bad boys , like mean people . no , i 'm a little edgy so i like someone who has that edge . you can have that edge , and you might not notice it by looking at someone , but it 's in there ... i 'm into nice guys !

" the @placeholder are unlike anything else on the planet , " hard - core fan says	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has been to @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , 101 times . " the @entity6 are unlike anything else on the planet , " he said . @entity1 , who runs the @entity6 fan site @entity10 , will be in @entity3 this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort 's 40th birthday . since its opening on october 1 , 1971 , @entity2 -- or @entity2 , as it 's often referred to online -- has become the world 's most visited recreational resort . it 's also more than twice the size of @entity20 's @entity19 island . people get married there , they go there on their honeymoons ( more than anywhere else in the continental @entity26 ) , and of course it 's a major destination for families . for those who go over and over again , like @entity1 , there is a big nostalgia factor . he counts attractions that no longer exist at the park among his favorites . " i think the fascination is partly nostalgia for characters & childhood memories and partly the promise of fun , " the ireporter said . " you know when you go to @entity2 , you are going to have fun . there are n't many places you can take the family and have that guarantee . " for other repeat visitors , like @entity50 , a visit to the resort can mark an important point in their lives . " i was newly sober and only had one day to spend at @entity2 while in @entity3 for business [ in 1993 ] , " he said . " my first park was @entity59 , and as a result of that visit , i became enamored with everything @entity6 . i promised myself for each year i stayed sober , i would reward myself with a visit to @entity2 . " @entity50 eventually moved to @entity3 and started the websites @entity65 and @entity66 . @entity50 does n't think one thing in particular makes the parks so special . like him , many who visit the parks have one special memory they take with them . " everyone has a story -- a memory -- that they relive every time they return , " he said . " @entity6 is really its own world -- and a place where you can escape from reality without any of the negative consequences that usually come with other forms of escapism . " check out more ireports of @entity6 memories @entity87 , another hard - core fan , ireporter and creator of @entity90 , said he remembers specific moments instead of rides or attractions : " sharing a great meal with a great collection of friends , watching my wife 's face light up as she watches fireworks burst overhead , or wandering old stomping grounds with my mom and dad . @entity2 is , for me , the magical place that means so much to my friends and family , and they are the heart of my experiences there . " just before packing for his 102nd trip to the parks , @entity1 said that he believes @entity2 is " unlike anything else on the planet . sure , there are other theme parks , but they are n't even close to @entity2 in popularity , quality , and most certainly in meaning to @entity26 culture . " watch an ireporter 's home movie of @entity121 and @entity2 in 1974 for hard - core fans like @entity1 , @entity2 history is something that is discussed on the many websites devoted to the parks . here are some important dates in @entity2 history : october 1 , 1971 : nearly five years after the death of @entity6 , the resort bearing his name officially opens in an area that used to be swampland , with @entity136 theme park attractions like " @entity137 , " the @entity138 , the @entity139 and the @entity140 . the resort surrounding the park would bring in tourists from all over the globe over the next 40 years . december 15 , 1973 : @entity145 , one of the most popular rides of all time , opens in the @entity136 's @entity149 . january 15 , 1975 : two centerpieces of @entity136 's @entity151 -- the @entity153 roller coaster and the @entity154 show -- open to the public . june 11 , 1977 : the first @entity156 takes place in the @entity136 , state of the art for its time . october 1 , 1982 : @entity6 's vision of the future , @entity59 ( consisting of @entity59 and @entity161 ) , opens with attractions such as @entity163 , @entity165 's @entity164 and @entity166 . fan favorites @entity167 ( introducing the original characters @entity167 and @entity170 ) and @entity171 would open within the year . september 12 , 1986 : @entity172 stars in " @entity173 , " which makes its world premiere at @entity59 . ( it would return to the park in 2010 , in memory of the pop star , after a 16 - year absence . ) @entity172 at the @entity136 in 1983 may 1 , 1989 : a third park , @entity6 - @entity181 ( which would herald a new spate of filmmaking in @entity3 -- at least for a short time ) opens .

lt. gen. @placeholder replaces lt. gen. @entity20 , who retires march 18	@entity14	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's prime minister named a new head of @entity4 , the country 's powerful spy agency and a critical element in the @entity9 fight against insurgents in both @entity2 and neighboring @entity11 . lt. gen. @entity14 , who is currently serving as an army corps commander in the region of @entity17 , steps into the new post , the office of @entity2 prime minister @entity13 said friday . the current @entity4 chief , lt. gen. @entity20 , is retiring march 18 , @entity13 's office said . the appointment has been approved by the head of @entity2 's military , gen. @entity24 . @entity24 submitted three names to the prime minister to select from for the appointment . a spokesman for the @entity2 army would not comment on the matter . " obviously , the army chief is close to all three of the individuals he recommended for the position , but we do n't comment on why he chose those names , " said maj. gen @entity30 , the army spokesman . a @entity9 official who was not authorized to speak for attribution said @entity39 " is close to @entity24 " and has served in key positions in both the @entity2 army and at the @entity4 . the official also said @entity39 is familiar with the @entity9 . " during his career , ( @entity39 ) traveled to the @entity9 to participate in @entity9 military sponsored training and international fellowship programs , " the official said . it remains to be seen how @entity39 's appointment affects the country 's intelligence relationship with the @entity9 . however , the @entity9 official said , " we would expect ( @entity39 ) to continue cooperation with the @entity9 in our mutual fight against terrorism . " the @entity9 relies on the cooperation to aid its efforts to target @entity57 and the @entity58 , especially as @entity2 - based insurgents continue to provide critical support and manpower to the insurgency in @entity11 . the appointment comes as @entity2 is reconsidering its ties to the @entity9 intelligence service after a tense 2011 in which @entity2 was kept out of the loop as @entity9 intelligence tracked @entity57 founder @entity69 to a @entity2 town , flew undetected into the country and killed him . that was followed by the killing of two dozen @entity2 troops when @entity9 and @entity77 forces fired on two border outpost under the mistaken belief they were being attacked by @entity58 . in addition , @entity9 government and military officials have accused the @entity4 of aiding and protecting the @entity58 . the former chairman of the @entity84 , adm. @entity83 , accused the @entity4 of protecting a key @entity58 group , the @entity85 , calling it a " veritable arm " of the @entity2 spy agency . the effect was to chill @entity2 cooperation with the @entity9 . @entity9 drone strikes targeting @entity57 and the @entity58 were paused for over a month after the border incident but have since resumed . even with the tension , there continues to be a " back and forth " of information sharing , the head of the @entity93 , @entity94 , said in january . he described the relationship as " strained " and " fraught , " but said there continued to be intelligence discussions . the @entity2 parliament is preparing an assessment of the overall @entity9 - @entity2 relationship , including the intelligence agencies . that will then be used as basis for the @entity2 cabinet to advise on how the country should move forward . @entity0 's @entity110 and @entity111 reported this story from @entity2 ; @entity113 and @entity114 reported from @entity115 .	@entity20:Ahmed Shuja Pasha	@entity24:Ashfaq Pervez Kayani	@entity115:Washington	@entity83:Mike Mullen	@entity84:Joint Chiefs of Staff	@entity85:Haqqani network	@entity111:Nasir Habib	@entity110:Reza Sayah	@entity2:Pakistan	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:Inter-Services Intelligence	@entity9:U.S.	@entity57:al Qaeda	@entity77:NATO	@entity58:Taliban	@entity17:Karachi	@entity30:Athar Abbas	@entity14:Zahir Ul-Islam	@entity13:Gilani	@entity11:Afghanistan	@entity39:Ul-Islam	@entity94:David Petraeus	@entity93:Central Intelligence Agency	@entity114:Pam Benson	@entity69:Osama bin Laden	@entity113:Adam Levine
the @placeholder says @entity23 has the world 's highest rate of internal displacement	@entity41	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's life and livelihood vanished in a matter of seconds . when a fumigation plane flew over his farm in september 2010 , mistakenly targeting his crops with coca eradication chemicals , his small cacao , yucca and plantain plants did n't stand a chance . @entity15 and crisp , they can no longer produce food . @entity19 , his four children and his pregnant wife , @entity18 , fled to a city slum more than eight hours away and prayed they would be able to return to lush green land someday . they are among @entity23 's more than 3 million desplazados , or displaced population . the founders of @entity25 , a nonprofit organization trying to turn an international spotlight on the plight of displaced farmers in @entity23 , want to make sure @entity19 's voice is heard . " we 're an organization that believes in story telling as a means to bridge the gap between the @entity38 and the developing world , " give us names co-director and editor @entity33 said . headquartered in @entity40 , give @entity41 released its first documentary , " leaving @entity43 , " in september . it tells @entity19 's story in an effort to end displacement in @entity23 caused by illicit crop fumigations . these aerial fumigations are heavily funded as a part of @entity23 , a complex $ 7.5 billion program started in 1999 during the @entity53 administration . @entity23 supports the nation 's efforts against the drug trade by investing in various military and anti-drug operations . " the aerial eradication program run by the government of @entity23 has been extraordinarily successful , " said @entity59 , director of the @entity60 at the @entity61 in @entity62 . he said coca cultivation in the @entity67 country has decreased about 40 % and cocaine production has dropped 60 % since @entity23 's inception . he also said homicides are down by 50 % , and terrorism and kidnappings are down more than 90 % . displacement in @entity23 is extraordinarily complex , @entity59 explained . he lists poverty , floods , land titling issues , violence over land , coca cultivation , and terrorism as a result of drug trafficking and child recruitment among the main drivers forcing people from their homes . " when you take displacement out of the rather scientific and sterile ways we tend to talk about it , what you 're really talking about is human beings that are being pulled away from their trades , " @entity33 said . " things they know how to do , things that give them value ... and that is a deeply human and tragic issue of dignity . " according to a 2010 @entity102 report , @entity23 has the world 's highest rate of internal displacement . " we kept researching the top humanitarian crises in the world , and @entity23 kept coming up again and again on the top of that list , " documentary co-director @entity106 explained . give @entity41 spent months traveling , researching and filming in @entity23 . " we knew we wanted to get specific , to find a story to tell . we had searched for someone who would open their lives to us and tell us about the issue of displacement . " give @entity41 met @entity19 through a partner organization several months before his legal crops were fumigated . their relationship helped narrow the organization 's focus to displacement caused by fumigation . the documentary reports that @entity19 's neighbor 's coca crop — plants whose leaves are processed to make cocaine — remained untouched by the herbicide . " if your neighbor is growing coca , every attempt possible is made only to spray the coca itself , " @entity59 said . " there is some drift that happens . it 's very minimal , within 150 meters . " @entity59 added that a complete system in place in @entity23 allows people to file formal complaints through their municipal government . if the claims are verified by vigorous review , the farmers get economic redress for any legal crops that have been damaged by the spray program . story said few of these receive compensation for a variety of reasons , such as late filing , mixed legal and illegal crops , or lack of evidence of spray . according to documents from the anti-narcotics division of @entity23 's @entity166 , in 2004 , only one complaint out of 874 received payment . in 2009 , 4,442 complaints were filed . redress was paid to 107 of those . there are few statistics detailing what percentage of displacement is caused by fumigations . @entity177 , a @entity179 human rights nonprofit organization , estimates that 60 % to 70 % of displaced people from the @entity181 in 2007 and 2008 were linked to erroneous fumigations . " trying to get at the exact number of people who 've been displaced because of spray event is very difficult , " @entity59 said . he placed a loose estimate at less than one - quarter of 1 % . out of the nearly 3.5 million desplazados , that 's fewer than 9,000 people . @entity59 also said @entity191 has invested $ 2.5 million in areas like @entity43 , where it works with 5,000 displaced people . " certainly , our program has spent over $ 1.2 million focused on providing economic redress for those people who 've been affected wrongly by the spray program , " he said . " it 's a very rare and unfortunate thing that happens . each individual case is a tragedy in itself . " " @entity204 " also explores alternative solutions . give us names partners with other organizations to place displaced farmers in co-operative - style communities . " we want something better for @entity2 , " @entity106 said . " and because we want something better for @entity2 , we 're gon na work to make sure it happens . so we 're storytellers , but we 're characters within that story at the same time . " give @entity41 insists it is n't criticizing the @entity179 government . " we 're not attacking them at all , " @entity106 said . " we 're saying on our side as @entity38 citizens , we see that our policy 's not going the way it should be . so let 's talk with the @entity179 government , the @entity38 government , with different ngos on the ground , and see what are the best ways to move forward . " @entity226 , the government entity that assists displaced people , said it does not consider these types of displaced farmers among its statistics . @entity0 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Colombia	@entity25:Give Us Names	@entity15:Brown	@entity232:Andrés Gay	@entity233:Wes Little	@entity0:CNN	@entity177:CODHES	@entity179:Colombian	@entity191:USAID	@entity53:Clinton	@entity59:Story	@entity33:Roge	@entity2:Abelardo	@entity38:U.S.	@entity19:Joya	@entity18:Olga	@entity102:United Nations	@entity106:Collier	@entity204:Leaving La Floresta	@entity166:Policía Nacional	@entity226:Acción Social	@entity181:Guaviare region	@entity40:Atlanta	@entity41:U.N.	@entity43:La Floresta	@entity67:South American	@entity62:Bogotá	@entity60:Narcotic Affairs Section	@entity61:U.S. Embassy

@entity191 , @placeholder , mayor says at meeting that the bullied should stick up for themselves	@entity4	for anyone who has experienced the brutality of a bully , a blunt - talking mayor in @entity4 with a horseshoe mustache now weighs in with this bit of wisdom : " grow a pair . " looking and talking like an @entity11 figure , mayor @entity9 made his declaration while on the dais of the @entity14 last week . " i 'm against bullying , but i 'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world , " @entity9 said during the @entity14 meeting . " ( most ) people just have to grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves . " @entity9 imparted his advice while discussing a proposal to create an anti-bullying safe zone for students . his remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and , in subsequent days , around the country . councilwoman @entity33 immediately challenged the mayor . " it 's hard to just grow a pair when you 're a 10 - year - old girl , " @entity33 shot back . the councilwoman 's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor 's tough - talking comments have roiled many people nationwide , especially advocates of bullying prevention . what 's bullying indeed , in the past few years , a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and is n't -- bullying . sponsors of @entity52 say it 's wrong to view bullying as " a childhood rite of passage " and something to make " kids tougher . " in fact , bullying can be a traumatic experience , causing school avoidance , anxiety , depression and loss of self - esteem . some researchers , however , say " bullying " has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights , teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships . the bald , cigar - smoking @entity9 seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy , but he was n't backing down . he has also received some hate e-mail . " of course , i wish i would have put it a little different , a little less colorful , but let 's not lose track of what the message is , " @entity9 said in a @entity75 interview . watch @entity9 speak about the controversy " we 're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying , " he continued . " we 're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from ( something ) or never allowed through the zero - tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves . " the one i worry about the most is physical intimidation , and that 's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence , " he said . " but if somebody puts their hands on you , it 's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this . " people should " just tell the bully we 're not going to put up with this , " he said . raising two grandchildren @entity9 has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck . " i guarantee i 'm not raising them to be whiny , " @entity9 said . but he 's frustrated with school policies that do n't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves , he said . his grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle . in fact , the principal called @entity9 about the incident . " i asked my grandson afterwards , what 'd you do about it ? " @entity9 said . " i did n't do anything , " the grandson told him , according to @entity9 . " why ? " @entity9 said . " because i 'll get in trouble , " the grandson told him . @entity9 expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero - tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem . those zones empower bullies , @entity9 said . " how do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable ? " @entity9 said . " they do n't expel them or do n't suspend them . they have them come back to class , and you 're brought back in the same environment . " when @entity9 was in 7th grade , he was bullied by " a guy that kept pullin ' a knife on me , " he said . " i made up excuses not to go to school . ... i did n't tell my mom and dad what was going on , did n't tell my friends cause i did n't want them to think i was afraid of this guy , " @entity9 said . " finally it came to a head . i dropped him like a rag doll . everything was cool again , " he said . hate mail @entity9 acknowledged he 's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him . " i could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind , " he said . one e-mail was profane and condemning , but @entity9 read it aloud in a @entity75 interview . " hey there mayor ... just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth , " the e-mail read , according to @entity9 . " you have no idea what it 's like to be bullied . you have no idea what it takes for a 10 - year - old to stand up to someone who is picking on them . and you have no idea how much bad press you bring on @entity191 . that town is a backwards bastion for bigotry , and you made it worse by becoming mayor . " among experts taking exception with @entity9 is @entity200 , a @entity201 human behaviorist and therapist who appears on @entity204 television programs . " i would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully , " @entity200 said . " you can very easily say ' i 'm against bullying , ' but then blame the people , the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair . " what does that actually mean ? be braver and you wo n't get bullied ? i do n't think that 's how bullying works , " @entity200 said . " if we put responsibility on children to do an adult 's job , or to do a politician 's job or to do a teacher 's job , then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children ! -- to be adults .

the @entity21 striker and @entity3 both expressed disappointment in the @placeholder 's verdict	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- the two - match ban imposed on @entity3 striker @entity2 for swearing in front of a television camera has been upheld by the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) after an appeal by the player that the punishment was excessive was rejected . the decision means the @entity21 international -- who scored @entity3 's only goal in a 1 - 0 @entity14 quarterfinal victory against @entity15 on wednesday -- will now miss a crunch domestic cup semifinal against city rivals @entity17 on april 16 as well as saturday 's @entity19 clash with @entity20 . the ban was initially imposed by the @entity6 after @entity2 shouted expletives directly in front of a tv camera during his hat - trick celebration in a 4 - 2 league win against @entity29 last saturday . the 25 - year - old said his outburst had been provoked by " continuous verbal abuse from @entity29 supporters . " but in an official statement released on thursday , the @entity6 said : " @entity2 had admitted a charge for the use of offensive , insulting and / or abusive language , but claimed that the automatic penalty of two games was clearly excessive . " the commission did not accept the claim and @entity2 will begin the standard two - match suspension with immediate effect . " in a statement issued through his spokesman @entity45 to @entity0 , @entity2 said he was " gutted " to miss two matches . " i am not the first player to have sworn on tv and i wo n't be the last , " the statement read . " unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera , i apologized immediately and yet i am the only person banned for swearing .

@entity159 will testify to clear up " misrepresentations " he told @placeholder , a source says	@entity173	thanks to testimony and " real - time " video , lawmakers said they got their clearest picture yet thursday of the deadly attack on a @entity7 diplomatic compound in @entity8 , though questions and tensions remain as to how president @entity12 's administration handled the matter . republicans and @entity15 who attended closed - door sessions of the @entity18 and @entity19 intelligence committees described what they heard and saw as informative , albeit not necessarily conclusive . they vowed to keep asking questions , and keep holding hearings , to determine not only how ambassador @entity22 and three other @entity7 died but also whether officials were forthright in the attack 's aftermath . " a lot of light was shone on this situation , " sen. @entity26 said after a hearing of the @entity28 , which she chairs . " but we do n't have all the facts yet . we are , in effect , fact - finding . " added the committee 's vice chairman , @entity39 @entity14 @entity37 , " were mistakes made ? gosh , we know mistakes were made , and we 've got to learn from that . " legislators saw a " real - time film ( showing ) exactly what happened " on september 11 in @entity45 , starting before the attack began up " through the incident and the exodus , " said @entity26 . a source familiar with the @entity51 hearing said the video included shots of @entity22 being dragged out of the building . sen. @entity55 , an @entity56 @entity14 , described the footage as " a combination of video from a surveillance camera and a drone . " " it gave us a good picture , from the surveillance standpoint , what was happening , " @entity55 said . besides learning more about the attack , some @entity14 in recent days have focused on comments made by @entity7 ambassador to the @entity71 @entity70 days afterward , when she suggested the attack came after a protest against an @entity76 video produced in the @entity7 . several of those @entity14 -- including sen. @entity77 of @entity78 , sen. @entity79 of @entity80 and rep. @entity81 -- have vowed to block any effort to nominate @entity83 as secretary of state should @entity85 step down . sen. @entity86 : heads should roll over @entity45 , but @entity83 is not the issue " what is clear is that this administration , including the president himself , has intentionally misinformed -- read that , lied -- to the @entity7 people in the aftermath of this tragedy , " said rep. @entity89 of @entity90 , a @entity14 member of the @entity91 that on thursday convened a panel of experts not directly connected with the @entity45 attack . " the arrogance and dishonesty reflected in all of this is a little bit breathtaking . " @entity12 himself has stepped into the fray , saying wednesday that those who criticize @entity83 " because they think she 's an easy target , then they 've got a problem with me . " his comments did n't appear to dampen @entity14 criticisms of @entity83 and , thus , the @entity12 administration at thursday 's @entity116 hearing . a source familiar with that briefing said one @entity14 @entity18 member " got into it " with acting cia director @entity121 and director of national intelligence @entity122 about @entity83 's comments , challenging why they were n't as strong as they should have been on whether an extremist element was involved in the attack . @entity12 : @entity14 criticism over @entity83 ' outrageous ' after that hearing , rep. @entity130 echoed the president 's comments on @entity83 , saying those " claiming that the @entity71 ambassador had some different information ... are either unfamiliar with the facts or willfully ignoring them . " the @entity90 @entity138 said the ambassador got the same assessment as lawmakers that the violence in @entity45 began with " a spontaneous protest that evolved into something militant . " " we were given a very early assessment of events in @entity45 , and we were given an unclassified version that we could share with the public . that unclassified version turned out to be inaccurate , as we found out later , " @entity130 said . it was not clear if @entity83 's comments came up at the corresponding @entity19 hearing , though @entity26 did say , " we had a good back and forth , and it was not always the easiest thing for everybody . " then - cia director @entity159 -- who is set to testify friday before the @entity18 and @entity19 intelligence committees , one week after resigning citing an extramarital affair -- did develop unclassified talking points in the days after the incident , a source who has spoken to him said . but he had no direct involvement in comments made by @entity83 , which may have used some of @entity159 ' information but were otherwise distinct , the source said . @entity159 is testifying because he wants to clear up " a lot of misrepresentations of what he told @entity173 initially , " said the source , who is directly familiar with the @entity176 chief 's analysis of the situation . @entity178 releases official timeline of @entity45 attack he knew " almost immediately " that @entity182 , a loosely connected radical @entity183 group , was responsible for the attack , as suggested by multiple sources and video from the scene , said the source . at the same time , a stream of intelligence -- including about 20 distinct reports -- also emerged indicating that a brewing furor over the @entity194 video preceded the attack . the @entity196 eventually disproved the reports that film - related protests had anything to do with the attack . but this did n't happen until after @entity159 ' initial briefings to lawmakers , in which he discussed all the possibilities , the source said . @entity159 ' told @entity207 of @entity208 , @entity210 's sister network , that his resignation was not linked to the @entity45 attack and that he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with . @entity159 : i did not pass on classified info	@entity22:Stevens	@entity194:anti-Islamic	@entity26:Feinstein	@entity28:Senate Intelligence Committee	@entity80:South Carolina	@entity81:Peter King of New York	@entity159:Petraeus	@entity83:Rice	@entity85:Hillary Clinton	@entity86:Rand Paul	@entity89:Dana Rohrabacher	@entity130:Schiff	@entity173:Congress	@entity7:American	@entity176:ex-CIA	@entity178:Pentagon	@entity8:Libya	@entity51:House committee	@entity79:Lindsey Graham	@entity56:Indiana	@entity55:Coats	@entity77:John McCain	@entity76:anti-Muslim	@entity71:U.N.	@entity70:Susan Rice	@entity78:Arizona	@entity15:Democrats	@entity14:GOP	@entity12:Obama	@entity37:Saxby Chambliss	@entity39:Georgia	@entity19:Senate	@entity18:House	@entity208:HLN	@entity210:CNN	@entity122:James Clapper	@entity91:House Foreign Affairs committee	@entity121:Michael Morrel	@entity116:House Intelligence Committee	@entity182:Ansar al-Sharia	@entity183:Islamist	@entity207:Kyra Phillips	@entity45:Benghazi	@entity90:California	@entity196:CIA	@entity138:Democrat
@placeholder singing star keeps a low profile , works on albums for years	@entity12	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 is an anomaly . think about it : how many recording artists have enjoyed 20 years of success while never having toured ? @entity2 sets her own pace when making albums . " and @entity10 " is her first cd in three years . " the fans are very , very loyal , " says the @entity12 chanteuse . " they 're always saying , ' when is the next album ? ' they know when i finish in the studio it 's got to be a few years before the next album . " perhaps it 's the vast gaps between releases that help make @entity2 , 47 , the @entity23 's second - biggest - selling artist of all time ( after @entity25 ) . thanks to a stipulation in her recording contract , the @entity30 winner has the luxury of setting her own pace with each project , another rarity in the music business . she 'll devote two to three years to each album , flitting between her @entity38 castle and the studio , where she works tirelessly to perfect every celestial chord and layer harmony upon harmony . " i always felt that the music sells by itself , " she says . " the music has always been the successful aspect on my career and that means that , to me , i can always still stay very focused on music . " watch @entity2 revel in harmony » her latest album -- the seventh of her career -- celebrates both the drama and quiet contemplation that come with the winter season . called " @entity56 , " the release has reached the top 10 on album charts across @entity59 and in the @entity61 since its november release . and while @entity2 wo n't commit to the idea of taking her tunes on the road , she does hint at the possibility . " to actually tour with the songs would be wonderful . it would be very much on a large scale : the orchestra , the choir . there 'd be a lot of rehearsals , but it 'd be very exciting , " she says . @entity2 spoke to @entity1 about how her music is like an onion ( think layers , not tears ) , keeping a low profile , and marking the 20 - year anniversary of " @entity82 , " her breakout album . @entity1 : what does wintertime mean to you ? @entity2 : wintertime for me is a time when i do a lot of my writing in the studio . it 's a time i enjoy . and it 's very reflective and a very calming time of the year . throughout the year i gather a lot of musical inspirations and this is where i bring them to the studio and see what will evolve musically . @entity1 : you set out to make a @entity103 album . how did the project evolve ? @entity2 : i 've always wanted to put together a @entity103 album . so i was writing some @entity103 carols and what happened was some of the songs started to veer more into winter themes . and when i discussed it with [ producer and lyricist ] @entity113 and @entity115 [ @entity116 ] , they felt , well , within winter is the celebration of @entity103 , so let 's infuse the two themes together . @entity1 : a lot of people think of @entity2 as a soloist , but really you 're kind of a trio , are n't you ? @entity2 : i work with two other people , the producer @entity116 and @entity127 , the lyricist . the way i work with @entity113 and @entity115 is firstly i do the writing of the melodies in the songs , and that 's kind of the solitude moment for me in the studio , which i enjoy very much . when i have the melody -- the idea of the melody -- i play that to @entity113 and @entity115 . ... i get to see their reaction immediately . is this a song for the album ? and i can see from their reaction -- " yes , this is going to work , " or perhaps it 's not . there are a lot of ideas that @entity113 had wanted to experiment with . when i met with him first he had this idea of using a voice -- one voice -- as an instrument to layer many times and he knew my love of harmonies . some people who hear the songs think that we have a set routine , a set formula we work with . it is n't , ... because each song is very different , and it 's very spontaneous on my part . @entity1 : about the layering of your voice ... at any given time how many @entity165 might we be listening to ? @entity2 : i do n't count ! it 's a very spontaneous moment on my behalf . i will listen back to the last harmony i 've sung , and then i 'll sort of try to enhance that harmony . then @entity113 will decide if he 'll record my voice 20 times or 30 times [ for ] that one part . @entity1 : i read that you might [ record ] as many as 80 vocal tracks . is that a reasonable number ? and then i read 500 . that 's got to be ridiculous ! @entity2 : yes , it can be , but you have to remember that [ if ] it 's 500 vocals i would n't have sung them at the same time . we 're talking about over two years that we keep going back to arrange vocal parts on these songs . it 's a very slow process . @entity1 : it 's hard to believe that it was about 20 years ago that you made " @entity82 . " do you ever go back and listen to that record ? @entity2 : well , with the anniversary , yes , i 've been listening to " @entity82 . " it 's kind of like a journal for me . it takes you back to that time in your life . each song has its own little story and i can hear the life of that song . you know how it was written , what inspired me , what worked , what did n't work . but the nice thing about spending two to three years on an album is i can say there 's nothing i would change on any of the albums . @entity1 : you 've said that you change the formula a little with each album , but to an untrained ear your music has sort of stayed the same throughout your career . are you a believer in the saying " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " ? @entity2 : musically it has to be something that i 'm comfortable to perform . would we ever hear @entity2 with a guitar solo ? i say , " never say never . " and there 's a guitar solo on " my ! my ! time flies . " this happened because it suited the song . it 's always got to sound like me because it 's my voice and there 's always this little sense of melancholy that is inherent in my melodies . i think that 's because of my @entity12 culture . @entity1 : your manager has suggested that one of the secrets to your success is that you keep a fairly low profile . do you agree ? @entity2 : it 's very easy for me to keep a low profile because the focus i feel is always on the music . success and fame are two different things . and so i feel the success is always towards the music , which means that i can have a very normal and private lifestyle .	@entity2:Enya	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:NEW YORK	@entity12:Irish	@entity23:Emerald Isle	@entity38:Dublin	@entity25:U2	@entity115:Roma	@entity116:Nicky Ryan	@entity10:Winter Came	@entity103:Christmas	@entity113:Nicky	@entity56:And Winter Came	@entity165:Enyas	@entity127:Roma Ryan	@entity30:Grammy	@entity59:Europe	@entity82:Watermark	@entity61:U.S.

" the most important of those is , first of all , that they should take the seasonal flu vaccine two weeks prior to @entity24 , " @entity42 said . even with the guidelines in place , @entity53 spokesman dr. @entity52 acknowledged that it wo n't be easy keeping potential pilgrims away . @entity58 told @entity0 , " it was discussed in detail how it 's going to be worked out between the country and @entity3 to find out the best way to do it and , of course , to make sure that people do n't try to use their connections to get their visas or to get to go to @entity3 , because people are really very keen to go to the pilgrimage .

developer @placeholder plans to build a museum near ground zero	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- a three - story museum and sanctuary dedicated to @entity3 near the @entity4 in @entity5 is the latest plan from a developer who failed to build his " ground zero " mosque amid local and national opposition more than three years ago . rather than the 15 - story , $ 100 million mosque and community center that raised such ire , developer @entity11 now plans a smaller , three - story museum and sanctuary at 45 - 51 @entity17 , to be designed by @entity19 - winning architect @entity18 . " @entity5 's arts and cultural institutions have always been a great inspiration to me and i consider this opportunity to create a museum to be a true privilege , " @entity11 said in a statement released april 30 through his publicist , @entity21 . " commissioning an architect of @entity18 's talent is a dream come true . " in 2010 , @entity11 faced opposition to his mosque proposal from some families of september 11 victims , anti-islamic activists and others who thought the mosque was to close to the @entity4 . president @entity38 said he supported the right of @entity40 to build a house of worship on private property , adding that his support was not a comment on the " wisdom " of such a decision . @entity50 senate majority leader @entity49 and former @entity51 and " @entity52 " co-host @entity48 joined the debate , coming out against the site 's location . @entity11 tells @entity0 why he wanted to build the mosque although he did n't lay out a budget or timeline for construction , @entity11 's application to demolish the existing buildings at 45 @entity17 and 51 @entity17 were approved april 7 , a @entity58 spokesman confirmed . but the developer has n't filed the necessary paperwork for permits to start demolition , the spokesman said . @entity11 's news release did n't offer many specifics about what the museum will showcase , although " it will likely display rotating exhibitions of art and host academic and cultural events . " it 's not clear how much more opposition he might face three years later , but @entity11 has already taken at least one step to better negotiate the rough - and - tumble debate around @entity5 development : he 's hired veteran @entity5 publicist @entity21 to manage his communications .	@entity3:Islam	@entity17:Park Place	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:New York	@entity11:El-Gamal	@entity4:World Trade Center site	@entity21:Sheinkopf	@entity38:Barack Obama	@entity19:Pritzker Prize	@entity18:Jean Nouvel	@entity52:CNN Crossfire	@entity51:Speaker of the House of Representatives	@entity50:U.S.	@entity40:Muslims	@entity58:New York City Department of Buildings	@entity48:Newt Gingrich	@entity49:Harry Reid
@placeholder manager leaves during slow economy to force himself to change	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- big company . big salary . big sendoff . @entity4 says he left @entity5 because the chance to build something new " outweighed the need for stability . " that 's the formula millions of @entity13 workers used for years to map their career trajectory . conventional wisdom advised workers to land a job with a big company and retire with generous benefits . but there 's a new breed of worker who is making that formula seem as quaint as a @entity25 tape . they are the ultimate risk - takers -- they leave large , successful companies to pursue their own dreams even though the economy is reeling . they are people like @entity4 , who resigned as @entity5 's manager of new business development in 2007 to launch @entity34 , a startup that 's designed to inspire bloggers and users of social media sites . @entity4 says he was getting complacent working at @entity5 , despite the company 's domination of the @entity41 . he says he decided to leave @entity5 despite a shaky economy because he wanted to force himself to change . " being an entrepreneur is all about risk and innovation , not timing the market , " @entity4 says . " a good idea does n't wait for the perfect time to emerge . the ability to build something new outweighed the need for stability . " ireport.com : are you striking out on your own and starting your own project at home ? why leave a sure thing ? stability , though , seems to be a rare quality in the workplace . those who contemplate leaving the corporate cocoon ca n't help but pay attention to the constant news about corporate layoffs . their challenge : why leave a comfortable position in corporate america when there seem to be so few ? @entity70 had to face that question . he says he was a regional vice president at @entity72 , a company that provides retirement plans for nonprofit groups . he says the company had 5,000 employees , $ 400 billion in assets and 17,000 clients at its peak . but @entity70 says he started contemplating a change because @entity72 's corporate culture was changing . he started talking with a friend who ran a consulting firm , and he started paying attention to his emotions . " it was getting more difficult to get up in the morning , " he says . " i was n't enjoying my old job as much as i used to . the more i talked about the job with my new partner , the more excited i got . " @entity70 left @entity72 in march of 2008 . he is now an executive at a new company , @entity90 , which has 25 employees . now he does much of his own typing . he ca n't take clients to fancy restaurants . he even uses recycled paper for scrap paper to save costs . though @entity70 misses the perks of a large company , he says he received a lot more in return . " there 's much quick decision making , " he says . " i work in a culture where we are not afraid to try new things . " @entity4 , who resigned from @entity5 to start @entity107 , says the large resources of a company can actually slow down the creative process . a person might want to invent a product , but small things like the name of the product end up being discussed in a committee . " you do n't find that in a small company , " he says . " at my new company , @entity107 , we sometimes dream things up in the morning and by the afternoon have it live on the @entity41 . that never happens at a big company . " greater freedom is also what inspired @entity128 to resign from her position at @entity5 , where she helped build @entity130 , one of the company 's most successful projects . today , @entity134 is the founder of " @entity136 , " which helps web site developers ensure their sites can be found by potential customers , and " @entity140 , " which helps businesses use online data to better understand their customers . @entity128 says the challenge of creating something in an evolving space like the @entity147 was too great to pass up . " as hokey as it sounds , there 's more to life than money , " she says . " as much as i loved working at @entity5 , i am really enjoying the flexibility i have now , as well as the ability to really make a difference in the direction i choose to go in . " planning your exit those who leave the security of corporate life should not do it without research and a plan , some say . the notion of suddenly bolting a cushy corporate dream to follow one 's bliss may seem romantic . but some who 've done it say those thinking about making a change should make a frank appraisal of their talents and latch onto something unique that they have to offer . @entity70 , the retirement planning consultant , says he knew the @entity178 would soon change the retirement plans for nonprofit groups . he knew his expertise would be in demand . " i sat down and put together a three - month planning process , " he says . " i knew there was going to be a market out there where firms needed additional guidance . " all the careful planning , though , did n't remove his fear , @entity70 says . but he discovered something remarkable . once he committed to leaving , doors suddenly opened for him : people materialized to help him and amazing coincidences led to business opportunities . @entity70 , a devout @entity197 , says it seemed like his leap of faith was being rewarded . " no question , it was a scary proposition , " @entity70 says . " but my pastor preached about when you do the right things , the @entity205 will bless you as he sees fit . " yet @entity70 says he knew he could n't just lean on faith . " if you realize that you have some skill sets that are valuable , you can market yourself accordingly , " @entity70 says . " if not , you 're sitting there , waiting to see if you 're going to be downsized . " @entity70 says he 's happy with his move . he sometimes misses having the muscle of a big company behind him , but he no longer feels he 's being controlled by larger forces . he may have to do his own typing now , but at least he is writing his own script , he says . " if you allow yourself to have other people continue to dictate your future , " @entity70 says , " you 're at their mercy .

ranked @entity13 before beating @entity14 2 - 0 on wednesday , the 1988 @entity10 champions needed a good result before heading to the tournament in @entity17 and @entity18 . coach @entity19 gave a pointer to the opening @entity22 game against @entity24 on june 9 by leaving free - scoring striker @entity25 on the bench , as @entity27 spearheaded the attack with @entity29 and @entity30 on the wings . the @entity32 forward continued the form that made him the @entity36 's top scorer as he netted twice , while @entity37 's @entity30 also bagged a double . @entity39 scored the second goal with a superb free - kick in the 15th minute as the @entity43 playmaker shook off an ankle worry that saw him fail to finish the @entity14 game , while defender @entity46 sealed it with a header on 78 . @entity24 also wrapped up preparations with a win , bouncing back from the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity51 to beat @entity52 2 - 0 . @entity53 netted a first - half penalty and fellow central defender @entity55 doubled the lead in the second half . however @entity58 -- who face @entity60 in the other @entity22 opener -- crashed to a disappointing 3 - 1 home defeat against @entity63 as @entity64 missed a penalty . having been held goalless by @entity17 and @entity68 , the @entity67 finalists needed a good result but went 2 - 0 down as @entity71 striker @entity70 scored in each half . midfielder @entity74 reduced the deficit in the 57th minute , but @entity77 top scorer @entity64 's penalty was saved by @entity78 before defender @entity73 diverted an attempted clearance by teammate @entity80 into his own net near the end of the match . co-hosts @entity17 , who kick off the tournament with a @entity88 match against @entity89 on friday , won 4 - 0 against @entity10 minnows @entity90 . @entity91 and striker @entity92 scored before @entity94 's penalty made it 3 - 0 at halftime , while @entity97 added another spot - kick after the break in front of a 30,000 crowd in @entity102 . @entity104 boss @entity103 enjoyed his second successive 1 - 0 victory , but faces more injury problems following the home match against @entity108 . @entity103 has already lost midfielders @entity109 and @entity111 for @entity112 , and now @entity113 needs a scan on a suspected broken jaw and fellow central defender @entity55 will have a tight hamstring checked . @entity118 striker @entity117 scored the only goal of the game in the first half , but was taken off as a precaution in the second period . @entity124 conceded a late equalizer in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity127 , as striker @entity129 's second - half header was canceled out by @entity130 . @entity132 's team , who beat @entity134 3 - 1 on may 25 , will face the @entity135 in their @entity137 opener next weekend . in @entity7 qualifiers , @entity138 and @entity139 moved to the top of the @entity143 group after a 1 - 1 draw in @entity145 . however , both nations could be overtaken by @entity147 and @entity148 , who were to play fifth - placed @entity150 and bottom team @entity151 respectively later on saturday . in @entity155 qualifiers , @entity153 's @entity153 made a winning start to their bid to appear at the @entity7 for the seventh time , beating @entity159 1 - 0 . with captain @entity161 suspended , the winner came via a second - half penalty from @entity163 . in @entity22 , @entity164 beat @entity165 3 - 1 while @entity166 won 2 - 1 at home @entity167 . in @entity137 , @entity169 opened with a 2 - 0 win over 10 - man @entity171 thanks to goals from @entity175 winners @entity176 and @entity177 , while @entity178 fought back to earn a 1 - 1 draw away to @entity179 . in @entity180 , @entity182 champions @entity181 lost 2 - 0 away to @entity183 -- and next weekend face @entity184 , who thrashed @entity186 7 - 0 . @entity187 beat @entity188 3 - 1 in @entity189 , while on friday @entity190 won 2 - 0 against @entity191 in @entity192	@entity108:Belgium	@entity171:Tanzania	@entity175:European Champions League	@entity177:Didier Drogba	@entity176:Salomon Kalou	@entity179:Gambia	@entity178:Morocco	@entity78:Volkan Demirel	@entity74:Nani	@entity77:Real Madrid	@entity71:Toulouse	@entity70:Umut Bulut	@entity73:Pepe	@entity189:Group J	@entity145:Montevideo	@entity147:Argentina	@entity143:South American	@entity148:Chile	@entity68:Macedonia	@entity67:Euro 2004	@entity64:Ronaldo	@entity63:Turkey	@entity60:Germany	@entity159:Democratic Republic of Congo	@entity153:Cameroon	@entity151:Bolivia	@entity150:Ecuador	@entity155:African	@entity53:Daniel Agger	@entity52:Australia	@entity51:Brazil	@entity55:John Terry	@entity58:Portugal	@entity30:Afellay	@entity32:Arsenal	@entity37:Barcelona	@entity36:English Premier League	@entity39:Wes Sneijder	@entity129:Eduardo	@entity127:Norway	@entity124:Croatia	@entity46:Ron Vlaar	@entity43:Inter Milan	@entity22:Group B	@entity27:Robin van Persie	@entity24:Denmark	@entity25:Klaas-Jan Huntelaar	@entity29:Arjen Robben	@entity139:Venezuela	@entity138:Uruguay	@entity135:Republic of Ireland	@entity134:Estonia	@entity137:Group C	@entity130:Tarik Elyounoussi	@entity132:Slaven Bilic	@entity17:Poland	@entity14:Slovakia	@entity13:Bulgaria	@entity12:German	@entity11:Bayern Munich	@entity10:European	@entity19:Bert van Marwijk	@entity18:Ukraine	@entity102:Warsaw	@entity103:Hodgson	@entity104:England	@entity97:Marcin Wasilewski	@entity109:Gareth Barry	@entity94:Jakub Blaszczykowski	@entity92:Robert Lewandowski	@entity91:Ludovic Obraniak	@entity90:Andorra	@entity188:Liberia	@entity80:Ricardo Costa	@entity180:Group D	@entity181:Zambia	@entity182:African Cup of Nations	@entity183:Sudan	@entity184:Ghana	@entity186:Lesotho	@entity187:Senegal	@entity117:Danny Welbeck	@entity113:Gary Cahill	@entity112:Euro 2012	@entity111:Frank Lampard	@entity88:Group A	@entity89:Greece	@entity118:Manchester United	@entity1:Netherlands	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:World Cup	@entity4:Northern Ireland	@entity192:Group G.	@entity191:Mozambique	@entity190:Egypt	@entity201:South American World Cup	@entity163:Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting	@entity161:Samuel Eto'o	@entity166:Sierra Leone	@entity167:Cape Verde Islands	@entity164:Tunisia	@entity165:Equatorial Guinea	@entity169:Ivory Coast
@entity1 beat @placeholder side @entity6 2 - 0	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 secured their first victory in this season 's @entity3 with an unconvincing 2 - 0 victory against @entity7 side @entity6 at @entity8 in @entity9 . after a tepid first period the game burst into life in the second half with a string of penalties and red cards following a handball by the @entity6 defender @entity17 . @entity18 scored from the penalty spot but the relief was short lived . two minutes later , @entity1 's @entity22 center back @entity21 was harshly sent off for a high tackle on @entity24 . @entity25 pushed on but failed to make their numerical supremacy count , with @entity29 guilty of missing the target when found unmarked in front of goal . a second red card was flashed , this time for the @entity7 side , when @entity35 picked up a second yellow card . deep in injury time @entity18 was tripped in the @entity6 box and awarded a second penalty which he duly dispatched . it was a far from convincing performance from @entity1 , who now sit second in @entity44 , two points behind @entity47 's @entity46 who beat @entity49 2 - 0 in @entity50 . " we did n't have the penetration first half , " coach @entity51 told the cameras after the game . " [ @entity18 showed ] @entity56 with his two penalties , he took them well . " he was less convinced by @entity21 's red card . " he 's raised his foot and in the context of the interpretation [ of the rules ] i can see why he [ the referee ] has given it , " he admitted . " but it 's very harsh . " @entity65 kept up appearances with the neighbors after they too secured their first @entity3 win . city have found life harder in the @entity3 compared to the @entity71 - where they are currently top - and soon fell behind to @entity74 side @entity73 after @entity75 scored within four minutes . a @entity73 own goal leveled the match but @entity78 scored with virtually the last kick of the match to keep @entity69 in touch with @entity83 leaders @entity84 , who drew 1 - 1 with @entity85 @entity86 continued their perfect start to their @entity89 campaign by thumping @entity91 side @entity90 4 - 0 . @entity92 scored against his old club before @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 completed the rout . with @entity86 all but through to the next round @entity98 gave their chances of finishing second a boost with a 2 - 0 victory against @entity103 in @entity104 . @entity106 , on the other hand , is much harder to predict . troubled @entity107 went top after beating @entity91 side @entity108 on the road thanks to a first half @entity112 strike . meanwhile @entity113 beat @entity115 side @entity114 3 - 0 . but only four points separate top from bottom at the half way stage .	@entity22:Serbian	@entity98:Ajax	@entity21:Nemanja Vidic	@entity24:Gabriel Giurgiu	@entity25:Galati	@entity29:Bratislav Punosevic	@entity115:Turkish	@entity83:Group A	@entity84:Bayern Munich	@entity85:Napoli	@entity86:Real Madrid	@entity89:Group D	@entity3:Champions League	@entity1:Man Utd	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Romanian	@entity6:Otelul Galati	@entity9:Bucharest	@entity8:The National Stadium	@entity51:Alex Ferguson	@entity50:Switzerland	@entity56:Composure	@entity47:Portugal	@entity75:Ruben Cani	@entity74:Spanish	@entity71:English Premier League	@entity73:Villarreal	@entity78:Sergio Aguero	@entity17:Sergiu Costin	@entity35:Milan Perendija	@entity18:Wayne Rooney	@entity103:Dinamo Zagreb	@entity104:Croatia	@entity106:Group B	@entity107:Inter Milan	@entity108:Lille	@entity96:Sergio Ramos	@entity95:Mesut Ozil	@entity94:Sami Khedira	@entity92:Karim Benzema	@entity91:French	@entity90:Lyon	@entity44:Group C	@entity46:Benfica	@entity114:Trabzonspor	@entity69:City	@entity113:CSKA Moscow	@entity65:Manchester City	@entity49:Basel	@entity112:Giampaolo Pazzini
@placeholder contractors who responded to terror attack in @entity7 will tell their story to @entity25	@entity3	a @entity1 will hear from @entity3 security officers who are expected to tell a much more detailed story about the terror attack in @entity6 , @entity7 , that killed ambassador @entity8 and three other @entity9 last year , @entity0 has learned . the men , described by sources as former @entity12 , former @entity13 and former @entity14 , were under contract to guard @entity3 agents on the ground there . the security officers were among those who responded when @entity8 ' compound was attacked on the night of september 11 , 2012 . they will appear before lawmakers behind closed doors during the week of november 11 , sources told @entity0 . members of @entity25 have been trying to get access to the security officers and @entity3 agents , but those attempts have failed to date . of the estimated nearly two dozen @entity3 operatives on the ground that night , only one has testified , the sources said . frustrated lawmakers have told @entity0 they have been dissatisfied with the investigation so far conducted by @entity35 chairman @entity34 , @entity36 . his staff defends the work of the committee , telling @entity0 previously the review has included nine full committee hearings , roundtable discussions with some @entity45 administration officials , an interim report and a vow that the investigation continues . the members of @entity25 say they do n't want information that 's filtered like what they 've gotten in briefings and documents , but that they want to hear the answers to three basic questions straight from those who were there : one : what was the @entity3 doing in @entity7 ? there have been allegations the @entity3 was operating a gun - running program with weapons going from @entity7 to @entity63 rebels . two : what happened during the failed rescue attempts ? @entity0 has been told that there was a group of would - be rescuers at the @entity3 annex , armed and ready to go within minutes of the attack , but they were held off until finally they defied orders and staged a rescue on their own . sen. @entity74 pushes for answers three : did the administration know immediately that this was a planned terrorist attack ? and if so , why did administration officials try to first claim it was a spontaneous response to a demonstration over a movie that offended @entity83 ? " i think that there 's a real mystery here surrounding what really took place and for reasons unbeknownst to me , the @entity25 as well as the agency are going out of their way to protect whatever there was that they were doing operationally in @entity7 , " said @entity84 , a former @entity85 diplomatic security agent who has written a book about @entity6 that 's now being turned into an @entity88 movie . and sources say the @entity3 has been trying to keep its employees quiet . @entity0 reported previously that some operatives involved in the agency 's missions in @entity7 have been subjected to frequent -- even monthly -- polygraph examinations to find out whether they 've have spoken to @entity25 or the media , according to sources with deep inside knowledge of the agency 's workings . the @entity3 said in a statement this is " patently false . " " not a single @entity3 officer who was on the ground in @entity6 during the attacks has been subjected to any @entity3 polygraph intended to discourage them from speaking to @entity25 or as retaliation , " the agency told @entity0 . " to date , some of these officers have already spoken to the oversight committees on @entity6 , " it added . commandos were poised for @entity7 raid to get @entity6 suspect	@entity25:Congress	@entity83:Muslims	@entity84:Fred Burton	@entity85:State Department	@entity88:HBO	@entity35:House Intelligence Committee	@entity136:Republicans	@entity34:Mike Rogers	@entity3:CIA	@entity1:House Intelligence subcommittee	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Libya	@entity6:Benghazi	@entity9:Americans	@entity8:Christopher Stevens	@entity74:Lindsey Graham	@entity14:Marines	@entity13:Army Special Forces	@entity12:Navy SEALs	@entity36:R-Michigan	@entity45:Obama	@entity63:Syrian
@entity7 lawyers say @placeholder was a secretive drug addict even beyond his family 's help	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity5 's ex-wife @entity4 is set to testify in the @entity7 wrongful death trial wednesday , lawyers for the concert promoter said monday . @entity4 is expected to be questioned about @entity5 's drug use during the 1990s when she traveled with him , married him and bore his two oldest children . she will be called as the next witness in the @entity0 courtroom after an economics expert concludes his testimony aboutÂ the financial support @entity5 would have provided his mother and @entity16 had he not died four years ago . @entity5 's youngest brother made an unsuccessful effort to reach the singer in his last weeks because of family concerns about his drug use , according to testimony friday . lawyers for the concert promoter accused of liability in @entity5 's death want to show that the pop icon was a secretive drug addict who was even beyond his family 's help . jurors watched video of @entity32 's questioning by the @entity7 lawyers about failed interventions he led because of his concerns about @entity5 's use of painkillers in the last decade of his brother 's life . @entity5 died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol that a doctor told police he was using to treat his insomnia as he rehearsed for a comeback tour four years ago . @entity5 's mother and three children are suing the concert promoter , contending it negligently hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death . @entity32 testified that he and his father , @entity53 , were turned away from the gates of @entity5 's rented @entity0 mansion on @entity56 , the home in which he died weeks later . they were concerned because of " reports to me that he did n't look too good , " he said . who is @entity4 ? " after i had heard this , i said , ' come on , let 's go . we 're going over there , ' " he testified . other witnesses , including @entity5 's makeup artist and the show director , have testified that @entity5 suffered physical deterioration in the last two months of his life . " there was a drug issue , " @entity32 said , explaining why they wanted to reach him . " he was n't eating . all of these things were happening at the same and , you know , a lot of pressure . " he said he wanted to persuade his brother to leave rehearsals and enter a drug rehab program in @entity81 . " of course my brother would n't let me through because he would n't want me to see him like that , " he said . the security guard told him his brother was not at home , he said . @entity5 lawyers do not dispute that @entity5 had a drug dependency problem at times , but they say he went long periods of time without taking painkillers . the entertainer publicly acknowledged his dependency when he cut short his dangerous tour to enter a rehab program in 1993 . the drug use was connected to two decades of pain stemming from scalp burns suffered while filming a @entity102 commercial and several onstage accidents on tour , they say . he also used prescription sedatives to help him sleep , especially during the pressure of touring , they argue . the pressure was on again as @entity5 prepared for his " @entity113 " concerts set to debut in @entity112 in july 2009 , they say . @entity5 was getting nightly infusions of propofol in a desperate effort to cure his insomnia , which a sleep expert testified disrupted his natural sleep cycles and caused his physical and mental decline . @entity7 executives created an ethical conflict of interest by hiring dr. @entity125 as @entity5 's full - time physician for $ 150,000 a month , the @entity5 lawsuit contends . @entity125 could not refuse @entity5 's demands for propofol infusions since he was deeply in debt and could not risk being fired from the lucrative job , they argue . jury applauds witness in trial @entity7 lawyers say it was @entity5 who chose and controlled @entity125 , not the company , and they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the singer in the privacy of his bedroom . while @entity32 was questioned for several hours by @entity7 lawyers , only about an hour of the video was shown to jurors friday . most of it focused on his repeated attempts to interrupt his brother 's use of painkillers . " i wrote letters to my family about his problem and that we had to do something to help , " @entity32 testified . the letters would tell his parents , brothers and sisters that ' he 's an addict , ' and at this point , addicts are n't so responsible for what they do . so this is where the family needs to step in and do something about it because their desire becomes physical . " @entity5 testified that he " staged several interventions , " including in @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity0 . " four or five " of those attempted interventions were at @entity5 's @entity174 between 2004 and 2006 -- around the time of the child abuse trial in @entity177 , @entity178 , he said . @entity5 's ' pajama day ' in court @entity32 said he was able to get his brother off of drugs at one point , but he resumed just before the child molestation trial began in a @entity186 , @entity178 , courtroom in 2004 . " he was really scared . " he fired @entity5 nanny @entity187 because he suspected she was supplying his drugs , he said . " whenever she 's around , he 's wasted . " he asked older sister @entity189 to stay close to their brother , he said , telling her , " make sure you watch everything he does , because i have to get him in this courtroom every day and see this thing through . " @entity32 gave new insight into what happened that infamous day of the trial when @entity5 showed up late for court wearing pajamas . at the time , the singer blamed a back injury suffered when he fell in the shower , which sent him to a hospital that morning . ex-bodyguard testifies about singer 's drug use his brother testified , however , it was " because he did n't want to go to court . " " i went to the hospital and he said to me , he says , ' i do n't know what you 're thinking . i 'm not walking into that courtroom , so do n't even think about it , @entity32 , ' " he testified . " and i said , ' ok . ' i said , ' but you 're going to court . ' he goes , ' no , i 'm not . ' " @entity32 blamed the nanny for supplying " some kind of patch " that had drugs . @entity5 also described an incident in which his brother had a bad reaction to a sedative while at a @entity227 home in 2005 . the nanny called him , saying , " you need to get over here . something 's not right , " he testified . a doctor who lived nearby paid a house call and treated him , he said . he said his brother would " kind of hide from me " because he did n't want him to know about his drug use , @entity5 said . monday is the start of the 16th week of testimony in the trial , which the judge told jurors could last until the end of september .	@entity81:San Francisco	@entity113:This Is It	@entity112:London	@entity171:Taiwan	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Los Angeles	@entity7:AEG Live	@entity174:Neverland Ranch	@entity5:Jackson	@entity4:Debbie Rowe	@entity178:California	@entity53:Joe Jackson	@entity56:Carolwood Drive	@entity16:threeÂ childrenÂ	@entity32:Randy Jackson	@entity173:Las Vegas	@entity102:Pepsi	@entity172:New York	@entity125:Murray	@entity189:Rebbie Jackson	@entity177:Santa Barbara County	@entity227:Beverly Hills	@entity186:Santa Maria	@entity187:Grace Rwaramba
@placeholder - @entity3 tensions escalated after incident between respective navies	@entity5	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 this week condemned @entity5 's " unnecessary escalation " of tensions between the two nations over disputed islets known as @entity9 in @entity5 and @entity9 in @entity3 . he was referring to two incidents in january when @entity5 frigates reportedly locked weapons radar onto a @entity3 vessel and a helicopter , a claim @entity5 denies . once fire - control radar is locked on , a missile can be fired at the designated target , generating obvious risks of miscalculation . at best this is a militarized game of tag but one that could , at its worst , spark wider hostilities . when @entity3 indicated that its jets might fire tracer bullets to warn off @entity5 aircraft , a @entity5 general responded that @entity3 should refrain from doing so , as this would be taken as an act of war . in this context , there is good reason to be concerned that @entity33 is sleepwalking its way towards war . on february 6 , @entity2 told the country 's parliament , known as the @entity38 , " the incident is dangerous conduct that could have led to an unforeseeable situation . it is extremely regrettable that @entity5 carried out such a one - sided , provocative act when signs are emerging for dialogue . " he added , " i ask the @entity5 side to return to the spirit of mutually beneficial , strategic relations and prevent the recurrence of an incident like this . i strongly ask them for restraint so that the situation will not escalate further . " the probing has escalated in 2013 as both sides have scrambled jets and patrol boats shadow each other . given the perilous state of bilateral relations , and recent efforts at fence - mending , why the radar - rattling ? and why did @entity2 only go public with his concern a week after the latest incident ? the @entity66 initially seemed curiously unprepared for @entity2 's allegations , deflecting questions and suggesting reporters ask the relevant agencies involved . but the spokeswomen did say that @entity3 should stop conducting " illegal activities , " meaning the deployment of @entity3 ships and jet aircraft in the disputed seas and airspace around the @entity9 . @entity5 's @entity78 pugnaciously dismissed @entity2 's allegations as a " self - directed and self - acted farce , " staged in preparation for his visit to @entity82 later this month . @entity2 is known to seek closer security cooperation with the @entity84 and has stated that he intends to revise the @entity85 to ease constraints on the @entity3 military . it is not clear how @entity2 could exploit the incident to sway the @entity91 administration since it does n't reveal anything about @entity5 that @entity82 does n't already know and worry about . the radar incident may indeed play into @entity2 's hands , reminding @entity3 that they live in a dangerous neighborhood . but given @entity99 's missile and nuclear testing program , it 's safe to say they already know that . the @entity3 media reaction has been predictably outraged , but the @entity104 did point out that @entity5 's actions signal frustration with the @entity3 government 's intransigent position of denying that there even is a territorial dispute . @entity3 knows from experience how frustrating this can be as @entity113 also maintains there is no territorial dispute regarding what @entity3 calls the @entity117 , near @entity118 . when former premier @entity120 recently visited @entity5 , he caused a stir at home when he acknowledged that there is a territorial dispute , prompting the defense minister to call him a traitor . so is this merely a case of @entity2 hyping the dangers poised by @entity5 to advance his agenda of constitutional revision ? or is @entity5 upping the ante in a calculated risk ? probably a bit of both . revising @entity3 's peace constitution is controversial with voters and @entity2 is eager to gain control of the @entity138 in summer elections . since @entity2 has a lock on security issues , focusing on the @entity5 threat has its uses . equally , @entity144 is keen to remind @entity0 that this problem will not go away and that it will continue to press its claim to sovereignty and is willing to take disproportionate risks to pressure @entity3 into at last acknowledging there is a dispute . in january , a succession of prominent @entity3 politicians visited @entity5 , signaling a thaw in relations . @entity155 , head of @entity156 , @entity2 's ruling coalition partner , delivered a letter from @entity2 to @entity159 chairman @entity158 . @entity158 responded quite positively to @entity2 's call for improving relations and a summit . his comments led to a brief toning down of fiery rhetoric in @entity5 . the incidents also follow @entity5 's efforts to involve the @entity167 in the dispute to determine the validity of its claim that the islands are a natural extension of its continental shelf . the radar - rattling also raises questions about who gave the orders or whether the frigate captains were acting at their own discretion . @entity182 images notwithstanding , this incident underscores the reality that there are various state actors in @entity5 with varying agendas . the problem is that the island dispute has become highly politicized in @entity5 and the genie of nationalism limits room for maneuver . emotions run high and in such a context the current dead - end policy is the path of least resistance . is @entity33 heading toward war just as @entity199 did a century ago ? there are also parallels with @entity3 's withdrawal from the @entity203 80 years ago in february 1933 over censure of its occupation of @entity206 and subsequent aggression throughout @entity33 until its defeat in 1945 . @entity5 suffered more than any other country from this rampage . like @entity5 today , @entity3 felt that the international status quo was biased and denying what it deemed its legitimate aspirations . it decided to modify that status quo by force of arms . history does n't repeat itself , but @entity217 reminds us that it sometimes rhymes . in 1913 and 1933 , there was a rational expectation that cooler heads would prevail and governments would come to their senses . @entity33 in 2013 may not be sliding towards war and @entity5 and @entity3 understand how mutually beneficial relations have been , and how much they risk losing , but we also know the folly of assuming risk away . leadership transitions generate risk because new leaders need to project strength , a need that complicates the compromises necessary to lower bilateral tensions . the zigzagging of diplomacy and confrontation on display highlights that re-shelving the sovereignty issue and managing this dispute wo n't be easy . the increased diplomatic activity is a good sign , and should urgently focus on hammering out a code of conduct in the disputed seas and airspace that can help prevent armed miscalculations . both nations have already agreed to establish an emergency hotline and it 's now time to get that connected . let 's hope that the various lessons of 1913 and 1933 are absorbed by all the relevant parties , including @entity82 , and @entity33 's two leading nations wake up before a nightmare descends . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .	@entity117:Northern Territories	@entity82:Washington	@entity158:Xi	@entity84:U.S.	@entity138:Upper House of the Diet	@entity258:Jeff Kingston	@entity156:New Komeito	@entity155:Natsuo Yamaguchi	@entity118:Hokkaido	@entity3:Japan	@entity2:Abe	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Tokyo	@entity5:China	@entity9:Senkaku	@entity78:Global Times	@entity33:Asia	@entity38:Diet	@entity217:Mark Twain	@entity104:Mainichi	@entity99:North Korea	@entity203:League of Nations	@entity264:Kingston	@entity206:Manchuria	@entity91:Obama	@entity167:United Nations	@entity144:Beijing	@entity199:Europe	@entity182:Monolithic	@entity159:Communist Party	@entity120:Yukio Hatoyama	@entity66:Chinese Foreign Ministry	@entity113:Russia	@entity85:Constitution
the @placeholder site is expanding into aggregation , starting with 26 popular craft sites	@entity36	( @entity0 ) -- some people hire florists and caterers when planning their wedding . former @entity6 employee @entity5 brought on a programmer to create a custom app. that personal app grew into @entity10 , a real product that helps people design wedding sites , and @entity5 went on to create her own lifestyle how - to company called @entity16 , which combines crafting , homemaking and a bit of tech. in the year since it launched , @entity16 has created tons of step - by - step posts , filmed how - to videos staring @entity5 , brought in user - generated projects and started selling merchandise such as crafting starter kits , books and subscription boxes called @entity28 . for $ 20 a month , @entity16 will deliver a @entity30 box filled with crafting materials and instructions for projects such as gloves that work on touchscreen devices . last week , @entity36 entered its newest stage by branching out into content aggregation with a feature called @entity5 's @entity40 . the company is pulling in posts from 25 popular crafting and style sites , including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , and hand - picking the best posts to share with the @entity36 readers . inspired by the maker movement and the tech culture of @entity52 , @entity5 wanted to combine her interest in technology and crafting with the popular @entity50 . " there was really no voice or teacher , specifically on the female side , who was really sharing all of these new innovations with those inspired to live creatively , " she said of the maker culture . the projects on @entity36 are fairly simple and meant to be completed quickly , but many incorporate cool gadgetry such as @entity67 and laser printers , or wired elements such as @entity71 kits , which are do - it - yourself computing and circuitry kits . there are recipes for no - bake peanut butter and jelly pie , instructions on how to create homemade headbands in less than five minutes , and plenty of @entity81 app and accessory round - ups . one of @entity5 's favorite recent projects was an @entity85 cowboy hat she wore to the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88 . using @entity90 pieces , she stitched wire into the hat to spell out her @entity94 handle . " being from @entity88 , it really showed who i am : a little bit style , a little bit country and a little bit tech , " said @entity5 . @entity5 says she aspires to be a combination of @entity101 and @entity102 . she worked with @entity104 ceo @entity103 in the past , and @entity103 is an investor in @entity16 the company raised a $ 1.25 million seed round of funding last year from a group that also included @entity110 , the former chairman of @entity111 and co-founder of @entity113 . in an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of @entity117 like @entity118 , @entity5 avoids saying the word " craft , " which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks . instead she enthusiastically uses the word " hack " to describe any time - or money - saving trick . for example , she hacked a @entity128 fitness tracking device by wrapping the bracelet in gold wire to make it look less like a sports accessory and more like jewelry . at @entity135 , @entity5 's agreeable , bubbly personality is a big part of the product . her photographs are used to illustrate the various projects . she stars in a the how - to videos online . and she is constantly promoting the brand in magazines and on tv programs . next week , she 's headed to the " today " show , where she will demonstrate how to use the @entity146 site to print metals in @entity67 . this personality - centric approach to branding is all part of her larger plan to emulate some very successful companies . " we 're trying to recreate what it is to have a person as the core of the brand , " said @entity5 .

" this generation specifically , as opposed to older generations , did n't spend enough time on the domestic arts , " said @entity5 , who aims to fill in the blanks for today 's busy , stylish and proudly geeky @entity117 fans .	@entity86:South by Southwest festival	@entity16:Brit + Co.	@entity28:Brit Kits	@entity110:Tina Sharkey	@entity117:DIY	@entity81:iPhone	@entity113:iVillage	@entity85:LED	@entity111:Baby Center	@entity87:Austin	@entity88:Texas	@entity118:Stewart	@entity171:University of Texas	@entity0:CNN	@entity174:Apple	@entity5:Brit Morin	@entity10:Weduary	@entity52:Silicon Valley	@entity50:Maker movement	@entity90:littleBits	@entity71:Arduino	@entity30:Brit Kit	@entity36:Brit.co	@entity146:Shapeways	@entity135:Brit and Co.	@entity101:Marissa Mayer	@entity102:Martha Stewart	@entity103:Mayer	@entity104:Yahoo	@entity128:Jawbone Up	@entity94:Twitter	@entity6:Google	@entity162:Walmart	@entity160:Disney	@entity161:Rockefeller	@entity45:Style Me Pretty	@entity46:Oh Happy Day	@entity47:Smitten Kitchen	@entity40:Picks	@entity67:3D
@placeholder : with @entity2 's death , @entity3 faces difficult transition	@entity257	( @entity0 ) -- the passing of @entity3 president @entity2 from cancer , long expected despite his condition being shrouded in secrecy , has opened a @entity7 of questions concerning @entity3 's future . the @entity3 constitution holds that power should have been given to the leader of the @entity13 , @entity12 , once @entity2 could not attend his own inauguration and new elections should have been held within 30 days . this did not happen . now , @entity17 , current vice president and @entity2 's hand - picked successor , will likely face divisions both from within the @entity20 of @entity3 and the @entity3 military to keep his hold on power . but he also is likely to receive a challenge for the presidency from @entity25 , current governor of @entity26 and former presidential nominee , when and if an election is held . conflict among the @entity20 , the military and the opposition will largely determine whether @entity3 has a smooth and peaceful transition or one that descends into violence as various factions lobby for power . since winning his first election in december 1998 , @entity2 dramatically reoriented @entity3 's government and economy . his efforts have particularly focused on poverty reduction , providing housing and health services for the poor . although @entity3 poverty data are heavily disputed , most figures show poverty has indeed fallen . @entity47 statistics show a decline from 50 percent of the population in 1999 to 32 percent in 2011 . inequality has declined as well ; @entity3 has the most equal income distribution in @entity52 . news : @entity2 leaves a revolutionary legacy the @entity3 economy has not fared as well , with economic growth from 1999 - 2010 averaging a mere 2.7 % , according to @entity58 figures . this stands out , given the strong economic performance of other @entity52 economies during this time and high global oil prices since the mid- 2000s ; oil exports comprise roughly 95 percent of export earnings for @entity3 . despite this windfall , the @entity2 government has done little to diversify the country away from its oil - dependence . at the same time , by using oil proceeds to fund social initiatives at home , support for @entity76 and other regional initiatives , such as @entity78 , which provides oil to mostly @entity81 countries on generous repayment terms , oil production has declined nearly 25 percent since 2001 . the state - owned @entity84 , @entity83 lacks capital to maintain existing production or exploit new reserves , notably the oil - rich @entity88 . this , and the horrible mismanagement of the company , have destroyed what was once @entity3 's industrial shining star . and now , with @entity2 's death , a power vacuum has opened in @entity3 . under the political coalition of @entity99 ( the @entity99 ) and @entity25 , the @entity3 opposition is the most united it has been under @entity2 . but @entity25 ' 11 - point defeat in october 's presidential election , coupled with @entity2 's allies winning 20 of 23 gubernatorial elections in december , underscores the fact that the opposition still holds little power . vice president @entity17 may not have the current president 's appeal with @entity3 , but he will still head a party with considerable influence . at the same time , the reaction of the @entity3 military will be key to the transition . the military can be organized into three camps : one is the institutional group , focused on the effectiveness of the military and largely non-politicized , and then there is the constitutional camp . with @entity2 's death , @entity12 , current president of the @entity122 , would preside over the country while new elections are called in 30 days . speculation is rampant that @entity12 , a former @entity3 soldier who participated in the 1992 coup with @entity2 , has stronger support within the military and they may push him as the next candidate . finally , there is the @entity133 camp that has committed itself to the revolution and will likely follow the late president 's wishes and push for @entity17 . @entity137 : tyrant or hero ? @entity2 allies have reason to be worried . under @entity78 , members received generous terms for oil purchases , with payments as low as 5 % of market value , and the remainder paid off through generous loan terms spread over 25 years . even better , payment could be made in manufactured goods , with a barter system replacing payments in numerous instances . @entity76 has been the prime beneficiary , receiving roughly 100,000 barrels of oil per day , which meets two - thirds of its daily requirement . if @entity3 's next leader were to end the program , or even reduce the generous terms , many countries would see a shock as import bills rise ( not to mention having to face a public forced to pay much higher energy prices ) . absent @entity2 's leadership , the @entity167 of the @entity168 might also find itself increasingly marginalized . extra-regional actors that have recently gained a foothold in @entity52 could find themselves losing influence . @entity174 in particular will have lost its biggest supporter in the region and may find future efforts to engage stymied without @entity2 's popular support . the @entity180 government , which has benefited from @entity3 's recent arms purchases , will likely find itself with a reduced footprint in @entity52 as well . furthermore , other @entity2 - supported regimes throughout the world , from @entity185 in @entity186 to the @entity188 government , will likely feel the effects of his death . for the @entity192 , oil supplies could be an important concern . while @entity3 imports have decreased in importance in recent years , falling to 8 % of imports in 2011 , it remains the fourth - biggest supplier to the @entity192 market . if the transition were to turn violent and exports dropped , @entity192 consumers could face higher prices and @entity192 economic growth could take a hit . @entity2 's passing also opens questions on narco - trafficking in @entity3 . transnational crime has flourished under @entity2 , with @entity3 serving as a major hub for shipment of illegal narcotics . not only has @entity3 cooperation with the @entity192 declined , the @entity192 has also added several high - level @entity3 officials to its @entity216 list , including former defense minister @entity217 , for their complicity with transnational crime organizations and support for the @entity221 . a prolonged struggle for power would likely give these groups even greater space to operate within @entity3 . at the same time , this could produce spillover effects in @entity228 , whose recent security gains , with the help of @entity192 assistance through @entity228 , may be tested if the @entity221 can move more freely between the two countries . if there is a transition and new elections are called for in the coming months , regional leaders will need to play a key role in calling for a peaceful and democratic transition . the @entity192 -- with @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity228 , and @entity242 -- should urge for free and fair elections . undoubtedly , @entity3 will remain divided no matter the next president , but fair and transparent elections will help ensure the next administration has the political capital to tackle needed reforms -- from a stagnant economy to rising crimes rates , rampant transnational crime and the rebuilding of the nation 's powerful state - owned oil company -- that will benefit all @entity3 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .	@entity20:United Socialist Party of Venezuela	@entity26:Miranda	@entity99:Democratic Unity Roundtable	@entity25:Capriles	@entity81:Caribbean	@entity83:S.A.	@entity84:Petróleos de Venezuela	@entity257:Meacham	@entity88:Orinoco Belt	@entity137:iReport	@entity133:pro-Chávez	@entity3:Venezuela	@entity2:Chavez	@entity216:Foreign Narcotics Kingpin	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Pandora 's box	@entity174:Iran	@entity192:United States	@entity52:Latin America	@entity78:PetroCaribe	@entity76:Cuba	@entity17:Maduro	@entity188:North Korean	@entity13:Venezuelan Assembly	@entity12:Cabello	@entity217:Henry Rangel Silva	@entity242:Canada	@entity241:Brazil	@entity240:Mexico	@entity122:National Assembly	@entity221:FARC	@entity58:International Monetary Fund	@entity167:Bolivarian Alliance	@entity180:Russian	@entity228:Colombia	@entity168:Americas	@entity185:Bashar al-Assad	@entity186:Syria	@entity47:World Bank
@placeholder mayor vows to institute changes -- quickly	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- federal civil rights investigators have found " reasonable cause " to believe that police in @entity4 , @entity5 , use " unnecessary or unreasonable force " with persons who have mental illness , the @entity1 said . the department 's civil rights division and @entity12 in @entity5 issued a letter to @entity4 mayor @entity14 stating that local and federal authorities will " continue our collaborative relationship to craft sustainable remedies . " in the 42 - page letter , federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct . investigators found cause to believe that the @entity26 engages in " a pattern or practice of using excessive force in encounters involving people with actual or perceived mental illness . " " we found instances that support a pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not , as a result of their mental illness , comply with officers ' commands , " said the letter , which was signed by assistant attorney general @entity33 and @entity35 attorney @entity34 . " we also found that @entity26 employs practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized . " one incident in december 2010 involved several officers who used " repeated closed - fist punches and repeated shocking of a subject who was to be placed on a mental health hold , " the letter said . @entity14 , in a posting on his web page , vowed that the city and its @entity26 would improve quickly , and listed a series of changes : -- the city will revise its use - of - force policies -- particularly those regarding the use of stun guns -- " to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness . " -- the police will expand their @entity76 -- composed of an officer and a mental health worker -- " to ensure availability at all times and enhance non-law enforcement capacity to respond to persons in crisis that do not pose a public safety threat . " -- the city will establish a mental health desk at its 911 calling center to ensure calls are properly dispatched . -- the city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options , such as establishing a 24 - hour secure drop - off and walk - in center , " that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis . " -- the city will use an early intervention system to identify officers , supervisors and units " for non-punitive corrective action , and to assess gaps in policy , training , supervision and accountability . " -- the city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct . -- a community body composed of representatives of a variety of groups will assess how well the agreement is being implemented , offer recommendations on additional steps , and advise the police chief and @entity14 on how to improve community relations .	@entity1:U.S. Justice Department	@entity0:CNN	@entity26:Police	@entity12:U.S. Attorney 's Office	@entity5:Oregon	@entity4:Portland	@entity33:Thomas E.

@placeholder has sent a patent application to launch barges to host its data centers	@entity14	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- forget the @entity3 and the @entity4 -- the ' computer navy ' is on its way , and digital media on the high seas are set to make a steaming comeback . new home ? barges like this one could soon play host to @entity14 's massive data centers . it seemed that floating media firms were a thing of the past when the @entity20 's last major offshore pirate radio station , @entity21 , followed other @entity23 and @entity24 examples and died out in the early 1990s . but , fast - forward 20 years and enter internet giant @entity14 . according to a patent application seen by @entity1 newspaper " @entity28 , " @entity14 is considering launching barges up to seven miles ( 11km ) offshore to host the massive data centers required to run its internet search engines . the plan would likely see the data centers -- which consist of huge supercomputers -- use wave energy to power and cool themselves while stationed at sea . in the application @entity14 states : " computing centers are located on a ship or ships , anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured , and turned into electricity and / or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away . " energy consumption is undoubtedly a massive issue for these giant data centers . the servers within each data center need to be air - conditioned to prevent overheating -- and considering a company such as @entity58 runs approximately eight million square feet of servers -- that 's a lot of required cooling . according to a 2005 study by @entity64 consulting professor and @entity66 staff scientist , @entity67 , the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005 . the total annual worldwide power bill for the servers at the time was an estimated $ 7.2 billion , according to @entity67 . the @entity74 has continued to grow at a rapid rate and other major companies have also been searching for a more efficient method of maintaining their data centers . @entity79 has looked into taking advantage of a cold climate by constructing a data center in @entity83 , while @entity84 is reported to be sending its computers down a former coal mine , using water below the ground as a coolant . but , how workable is @entity14 's project , really ? and does it mark a potential new future for the maritime industry ? dr @entity94 , reader in @entity95 at @entity96 , described the move as " an audacious risk " that will push the boundaries for major companies in future . @entity94 said the project would carry significant risks , but potentially very high rewards . " anytime you take on several new technologies at the one time -- and you are trying to build something highly reliable -- there are going to be real technical challenges , which there will be for these data centers , " he said . some major benefits of @entity14 's project include being able to save money on rent and property taxes by being positioned offshore , as well as saving money on electricity bills . " if you look at the percentage of power being used by these centers ... it seems like a good long - term bet for the future , " @entity94 told @entity2 . @entity94 believes @entity14 could also benefit from snaring a " green " image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems , in addition to providing a quality service to users . " one of the reasons @entity14 has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are . this will still allow them to do that . " he said there were some logistical issues , but if the ships were stationed not far from the coast , they should not have too many operational concerns . " at that distance ( 11km ) you would want to provide wired network activity -- some sort of under - sea cable . the sheer bit - rate needed for an operation like this is usually too high for most wireless systems , " @entity94 said . @entity94 does point out there could be plenty of maintenance required on such a system : " the sea is not exactly a friendly environment for cables . " although some commentators have raised concerns about the ships leaving themselves open to attack , @entity94 did not feel it was a major issue . " it 's not the kind of thing you see reported on very often . typically the kind of things we worry about more is network - based attacks . " current data centers are defended by corporate - type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances . @entity94 envisages a similar level of protection for the centers at sea , potentially using a protective barrier or guarding vessels . if this project is realized , it offers the potential to alter not only online commerce , but also introduces the potential for new strands of business in the maritime industry . @entity197 spokesman @entity196 said : " so far as i know there is n't anything quite like it . we have n't really seen anything like this since the old pirate radio stations . " @entity196 says that if the project goes ahead -- and more companies attempt to adopt a similar program -- it could provide a sizable boost to the maritime industry through the ships and workers required to establish , run , protect and maintain such operations .	@entity23:European	@entity20:United Kingdom	@entity21:Radio Caroline	@entity24:American	@entity28:The Times	@entity83:Siberia	@entity84:Sun Microsystems	@entity3:Royal Navy	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:London	@entity0:England	@entity4:U.S. Marines	@entity197:Maritime eCommerce Association	@entity196:Nilson	@entity79:Microsoft	@entity74:Internet	@entity58:IBM	@entity14:Google	@entity96:University College London	@entity95:Computer Systems and Networks	@entity94:Karp	@entity66:Lawrence Berkeley National Labs	@entity67:Koomey	@entity64:Stanford University
the sport has been gaining momentum in @entity0 , @placeholder	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- off track , @entity3 is a rather introverted young woman who works as a photographer in @entity0 . on track , however , she pulls on black tights and slips into roller skates to transform into " @entity9 " -- a hard - hitting , sharp - moving diva on wheels .

" quirky outfits fast - paced and full - contact , roller derby involves endurance , teamwork and crashes -- all on wheels . as much a bump - and - bruise sport as a lifestyle , derby 's alternative edge is on full - on display on the rink . roller girls typically don colorful skates , protective pads and quirky outfits as they race on a flat oval track , body checking each other to impede opponents from earning points for their team .

" one of the most important things about roller derby is your derby name , " explains @entity78 , who founded @entity26 in 2010 . " i know it seems kitsch and silly but it 's something people get excited about and historically people had derby names because they did n't want to participate in such an aggressive spectacle sport and compromise their professional career . " what is roller derby ? roller derby is a sport that requires strategy , team spirit and lots of body checking . a derby match , called a bout , is played by two teams consisting of jammers , who are the point scorers , and blockers , the team 's line of defense . the goal is for the jammers to get past the other team 's blockers and then lap them . once the jammer has done so , the team gets a point for every skater she passes . read this : @entity121 cricket warriors -- " @entity118 is like throwing a spear " along the way , the action is rough and rowdy .

" full impact -- we 're tough ; we 've got our team 's points on the line so we 're fighting for that . " comeback roller derby first took off as a competitive sport in the @entity139 in the 1930s but later evolved into a tv spectacle sport , much like @entity141 . its popularity decreased in the 1980s but an all - women league in @entity144 helped re-invent the sport in the early 2000s , this time with a bigger emphasis on athleticism . @entity32 's " whip it " gave the sport attention around the world , including in @entity1 , where its popularity has been growing steadily . the @entity26 league is made up of three teams -- the @entity20 , the storm riders and the @entity154 -- boasting a variety of female players , from working mothers and students to locals and ex-pats . men are only involved in a coaching or refereeing capacity . @entity78 says the sport is helping break stereotypes , crashing any notions that women ca n't be both tough and feminine . " @entity137 is one of the most multifaceted and dynamic organizations to be a part of , " she says . " it 's kind a do - it - yourself culture ; it 's gender empowerment because we praise the finer points of our gender without compromising femininity , but at the same time we are embracing strong independent women .

city host @entity15 on sunday , when title rivals @entity16 travel to @placeholder	@entity19	( @entity0 ) -- defending champions @entity1 marched five points clear at the top of the @entity4 on saturday with a 2 - 0 victory that left @entity6 in the relegation zone . @entity9 's team bounced back from last weekend 's goalless draw at @entity11 to put the onus on title rivals @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 . @entity15 travel to @entity14 on sunday , while @entity16 face a potentially tricky clash with @entity19 in the club 's first match since @entity23 striker @entity22 -- who is sidelined with injury -- made a surprise turnaround and decided to sign a new five - year contract after threatening to leave . @entity1 faced a @entity28 team who had not won since the opening day of the season , but made hard work of the victory after taking the lead in the 23rd minute . @entity35 helped @entity36 -- his fellow goalscorer in the midweek @entity38 win over @entity39 -- set up @entity41 winger @entity40 for the opener . the visitors belied their lowly league position and squandered several chances to equalize , coming closest when halftime substitute @entity47 's header was cleared off the line by @entity49 . @entity47 was booed when he came on the pitch by the home fans , who have still not forgiven him for the collision that left @entity1 goalkeeper @entity54 with a fractured skull four years ago . @entity56 replaced @entity40 with 18 minutes to play , and the @entity57 forward made it 2 - 0 on 81 when he finished off a series of passes involving him , @entity49 and @entity61 , who returned from injury to lead the attack . @entity64 moved up to third place with a 1 - 1 home draw against @entity67 in saturday 's early kick - off , after @entity70 's first - half strike equaled @entity72 ' goal for the visitors . defender @entity72 put @entity75 ' men ahead at @entity76 in the 17th minute with a deftly - struck left - foot free - kick that sailed into the top right - hand corner from the edge of the area , but the advantage proved to be short - lived . @entity64 , who made three changes to the side who lost 4 - 3 to @entity86 in the @entity38 in midweek , equalized three minutes later . capitalizing on a defensive mix - up between @entity67 goalkeeper @entity88 and @entity89 from a deep cross , @entity70 celebrated his return from @entity93 suspension to slot home his fourth of the season on 19 minutes when the ball fell at his feet just yards from the goal line . @entity67 looked to have greater energy as the game progressed though @entity102 , who had managed well as @entity67 's only forward , was replaced with @entity41 striker @entity104 after sustaining an injury . the move prompted @entity64 manager @entity107 to shuffle his pack and introduce the presence of striker @entity110 in place of speedy winger @entity112 , as both sides gambled for the win . promoted @entity115 joined @entity64 on 15 points with a 2 - 1 victory at home to @entity119 , moving up to fourth place ahead of @entity15 and @entity16 . @entity122 's team , had to come from behind after @entity123 could only push @entity125 's ninth - minute effort onto the post -- and the ball bounced back off the former @entity23 goalkeeper and into the net . but @entity131 midfielder @entity130 leveled eight minutes later after collecting @entity133 's throughball and beating keeper @entity134 . striker @entity135 made it 2 - 1 five minutes before halftime with a cool finish after winger @entity139 cut the ball back from the byline . @entity119 boss @entity142 brought on former @entity23 striker @entity143 for his first appearance since january , but his team could not equalize and have now not won away since the opening day in august . @entity147 moved up to seventh place after beating @entity11 1 - 0 to end a run of five successive draws , as @entity152 's first - half own - goal proved the difference between the teams . the @entity156 defender could only divert @entity159 midfielder @entity158 's 25th - minute cross into his own net , and @entity11 earlier saw winger @entity161 hit the post and striker @entity163 completely miskicked in front of goal in the second half . @entity147 have scored just 11 times in nine league matches -- seven from @entity23 striker @entity169 , two from record signing @entity170 , and two own - goals . @entity173 joined @entity147 on 12 points with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity176 , who moved above @entity119 into 14th place . @entity176 took the lead just before the hour mark through @entity182 striker @entity181 , but @entity184 forward @entity183 leveled in the 66th minute . @entity185 moved up to 12th place with a 2 - 0 win over @entity188 , who also have 10 points along with @entity67 , @entity19 and @entity176 . defender @entity191 scored @entity185 's first home goal since august 21 in the 36th minute , nodding in from close range after @entity194 headed against the crossbar . the giant @entity197 striker scored his second goal in successive matches 10 minutes after the halftime break when @entity188 could not clear @entity191 's cross . @entity202 won 2 - 1 at bottom club @entity203 in the late match to move above @entity11 on goal difference , with young striker @entity206 netting a 68th - minute winner for his fifth league goal this season . @entity203 went ahead in the 12th minute through striker @entity210 's first of the campaign , but visiting captain @entity212 leveled 10 minutes later .	@entity22:Wayne Rooney	@entity23:England	@entity169:Darren Bent	@entity28:Wolves	@entity135:Marc-Antoine Fortune	@entity115:West Brom	@entity158:Steed Malbranque	@entity139:Jerome Thomas	@entity112:Aaron Lennon	@entity86:Inter Milan	@entity110:Roman Pavlyuchenko	@entity88:Tim Howard	@entity89:Phil Neville	@entity131:Congo	@entity130:Youssouf Mulumbu	@entity119:Fulham	@entity170:Asamoah Gyan	@entity1:Chelsea	@entity0:CNN	@entity210:Carlton Cole	@entity6:Wolverhampton	@entity212:Kevin Nolan	@entity176:Wigan	@entity197:Serbia	@entity93:European	@entity9:Carlo Ancelotti	@entity194:Nikola Zigic	@entity191:Ridgewell	@entity156:Republic of Ireland	@entity41:France	@entity57:Ivory Coast	@entity133:Chris Brunt	@entity54:Petr Cech	@entity75:David Moyes	@entity76:White Hart Lane	@entity70:Van der Vaart	@entity56:Salomon Kalou	@entity16:Manchester United	@entity15:Arsenal	@entity14:Manchester City	@entity35:Nicolas Anelka	@entity11:Villa	@entity36:Yuri Zhirkov	@entity39:Spartak Moscow	@entity38:Champions League	@entity147:Sunderland	@entity173:Bolton	@entity19:Stoke	@entity102:Yakubu	@entity152:Richard Dunne	@entity104:Louis Saha	@entity123:Scott Carson	@entity107:Harry Redknapp	@entity203:West Ham	@entity202:Newcastle	@entity125:Zoltan Gera	@entity122:Roberto Di Matteo	@entity206:Andy Carroll	@entity188:Blackpool	@entity163:Emile Heskey	@entity161:Stewart Downing	@entity4:English Premier League	@entity142:Mark Hughes	@entity143:Andy Johnson	@entity181:Hugo Rodallega	@entity182:Colombia	@entity183:Johan Elmander	@entity184:Sweden	@entity185:Birmingham	@entity47:Hunt	@entity40:Malouda	@entity134:Mark Schwarzer	@entity159:French	@entity67:Everton	@entity64:Tottenham	@entity72:Baines	@entity49:Essien	@entity61:Didier Drogba
@entity260 : @placeholder is one of a few officials who knows full story on drones	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- the president 's pick for @entity4 director -- @entity5 -- is one of a handful of @entity8 officials who understands @entity8 's covert drone campaign inside and out . nearly everyone else is in the dark about the whos , wheres and whys of the program , including most members of @entity18 . but @entity5 is also one of the few @entity8 officials who 's stood in front of a public audience and tried to explain the targeting of terrorists outside recognized battlefields . and while overseeing a massive use of lethal force , @entity5 is also known inside the administration as a moderating voice in the fight against terrorism . the fact is , @entity5 's personal views are as opaque as the drone campaign itself . he may assume leadership of the @entity4 and decide a clandestine agency should not conduct what is an obvious military operation ( a stance i and many others would fully support ) ; after all , a veteran of the @entity4 may believe the agency should get back to gritty intelligence gathering . @entity0 explains : @entity8 drones or , maybe @entity5 believes that when it comes to the fight against @entity46 , the public and its @entity18 should trust the executive office to protect the @entity8 people by whatever means it sees fit . one way or the other , this week 's @entity52 confirmation hearings should be an opportunity to bring @entity5 's views out of the shadows , along with the basic attributes and justifications of the covert drone campaign . the man , the machine and the policy are inextricably linked . @entity63 : @entity5 , @entity8 's drone warrior @entity8 officials have consistently claimed that offering too many details about the covert drone program could threaten national security . fair enough ; some classification for national security is understandable . but the secrecy surrounding covert drone use is unduly excessive and not in keeping with the transparent government president @entity74 promised . since the bulk of @entity5 's hearing will be behind closed doors , the @entity75 has no reason to shy away from asking tough questions about the drone program . it matters that @entity18 is there to represent the @entity8 people . on their behalf , @entity18 has a duty to ensure the use of lethal force beyond our borders is being considered and carried out responsibly , with due consideration for the harm it may inflict on civilian populations . talk back : should @entity8 be able to kill @entity8 terrorist suspects without trial ? senators might ask a very basic question to @entity5 , one that is seldom clearly answered by the administration : " what impact is the drone campaign against @entity46 and its associates having ? " this is a fundamental question of accountability any @entity8 official involved in setting or carrying out counterterrorism policy should be able to answer . that answer may describe a dwindling kill list , but it must also put forward facts about what impact drones are having on civilians living under them . @entity8 armed forces in @entity114 and @entity115 learned that the positive or negative impacts of an operation on the local population are an important metric of mission effectiveness . commanders worked hard to reverse anti-american sentiment caused by a seemingly callous @entity8 attitude toward civilian deaths and injuries . in the case of counterterrorism operations , palpable anger toward @entity8 would be antithetical to the goal of decreasing the number of terrorists and those who support their cause . as it stands , it 's unclear whether anyone , including @entity5 , knows what negative consequences are emerging on the ground because of remote drones . rather , claims of low civilian casualties and drone precision capabilities paint a picture of extreme effectiveness in taking out terrorists while sparing civilians . it 's true that a drone is precise , meaning it will hit what it is aimed at -- a building , a bunker or a person . but there are valid concerns about whether the target hit is the right one . opinion : when are drone killings illegal ? remote drones likely rely on sources that may be questionable such as video and cell phone intercepts to identify a target . civilians may be mistakenly targeted as combatants and counted as such because there are no ground troops to conduct a battle damage assessment , interview witnesses or properly identify bodies . civilians may also get caught up in so - called " signature strikes " in which operators target individuals based on behavior , not on known identity . this is legally questionable but also has real ramifications for civilians living under drones . if a civilian in @entity182 does n't know what behavior makes him a target for @entity8 drones , he can not fully protect himself and his family . if a drone harms his family , even mistakenly , our research shows they wo n't receive an apology , explanation or any help from the @entity8 . certainly there will be no love lost for @entity8 . any deaths and injuries are compounded by psychological trauma , displacement and fear and suspicion among neighbors . one @entity182 told us , " we fear that the drones will strike us again . ... my aged parents are often in a state of fear . we are depressed , anxious and constantly remembering our deceased family members . " gen. @entity211 , the former commander of international forces in @entity114 , recently noted , " what scares me about drone strikes is how they are perceived around the world . ... ( @entity215 ) he resentment created by @entity8 use of unmanned strikes ... is much greater than the average @entity8 appreciates . they are hated on a visceral level , even by people who 've never seen one or seen the effects of one . " the drone program needs to come out of the shadows , with explanations about who is a civilian , who is a target , and how drone operators distinguish between the two . the @entity4 should get out of the drone operation business , handing it over to the @entity235 , which has a culture of learning lessons , accountability to @entity18 and a new openness about civilian protection after 10 years of war in @entity114 and @entity115 . drone operators should be trained in civilian protection best practices , and any civilian harmed should receive recognition and help for their losses , in accordance with the values @entity8 policymakers have espoused about humanity even during times of war . the @entity52 may confirm @entity5 as head of the @entity4 . it should also confirm where he stands on government accountability for lethal force and the @entity4 's role in the remote drone program . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .	@entity215:T	@entity0:CNN	@entity211:Stanley McChrystal	@entity5:Brennan	@entity235:Defense Department	@entity182:Pakistani	@entity4:CIA	@entity46:al Qaeda	@entity260:Holewinski	@entity52:Senate	@entity115:Iraq	@entity114:Afghanistan	@entity75:Senate Select Committee on Intelligence	@entity74:Barack Obama	@entity18:Congress	@entity8:U.S.	@entity63:Bergen
public radio retracted an episode after learning @placeholder " partially fabricated " information	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- acclaimed @entity2 program " @entity3 " has retracted an entire episode about working conditions inside @entity6 , the @entity7 manufacturer that builds much of @entity9 's most popular hardware , after learning the reporter " partially fabricated " information about his visit to the factories . in the episode , @entity2 aired a monologue from reporter @entity15 , a self - proclaimed performer whose one - man show , " @entity17 of @entity18 , " detailed alarming labor practices which he claimed to witness during his time visiting @entity6 . among the many facts @entity21 fabricated , according to @entity2 , were the number of @entity6 factories he visited , the number of workers he spoke with , as well a major lie about meeting with a number of workers who claimed to have been poisoned by chemicals used on @entity31 assembly lines . " @entity21 lied to me and to " @entity3 " producer @entity38 during the fact checking we did on the story , before it was broadcast , " the show 's host , @entity35 , wrote in a blog post on friday . " that does n't excuse the fact that we never should 've put this on the air . in the end , this was our mistake . " the retraction came even as consumers lined up friday to buy @entity9 's latest ipad amid protests over its treatment of workers -- protests that did little to dampen sales . public debate rages on about working conditions inside of @entity6 's @entity7 factories , which have for years been the subject of reports that employees endure long hours and unsafe working environment . @entity62 dug into the subject more than a year ago in a cover story after 17 @entity6 employees committed suicide . more recently , the @entity67 reported a series of investigative pieces further detailing the undesirable jobs of @entity6 employees . in an unprecedented response from the normally stoic @entity9 , the company responded to the reports publicly by cooperating with the @entity75 for audits of its entire supply chain . an entire page dedicated to @entity9 supplier responsibility can now be found on @entity9 's website . @entity21 issued a statement about the incident on his personal blog : " i stand by my work . my show is a theatrical piece whose goal is to create a human connection between our gorgeous devices and the brutal circumstances from which they emerge . it uses a combination of fact , memoir , and dramatic license to tell its story , and i believe it does so with integrity . " certainly , the comprehensive investigations undertaken by @entity67 and a number of labor rights groups to document conditions in electronics manufacturing would seem to bear this out . " " what i do is not journalism . the tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism . for this reason , i regret that i allowed @entity3 to air an excerpt from my monologue . @entity3 is essentially a journalistic -- not a theatrical -- enterprise , and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations . " " but this is my only regret . i am proud that my work seems to have sparked a growing storm of attention and concern over the often appalling conditions under which many of the high - tech products we love so much are assembled in @entity7 . " @entity2 's " @entity3 " website was bombarded with traffic upon news of the retraction , buckling the site under the torrent of traffic . @entity9 , @entity2 and @entity21 did not immediately respond to requests for comment . @entity62 confirmed that none of @entity21 's @entity142 performances of @entity17 of @entity18 were canceled after news of the retraction , save for one special broadcast : the april 7 show slated for performance at the @entity147 , which was originally sponsored by @entity3 and @entity147 public radio station @entity148 . @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report . subscribe to @entity62 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity0 .	@entity3:This American Life	@entity2:Public Radio International	@entity15:Mike Daisey	@entity0:Wired.com	@entity7:China	@entity6:Foxconn	@entity142:U.S.	@entity21:Daisey	@entity38:Brian Reed	@entity9:Apple	@entity17:The Agony and Ecstasy	@entity148:WBEZ 91.5FM	@entity149:Roberto Baldwin	@entity18:Steve Jobs	@entity147:Chicago	@entity35:Ira Glass	@entity31:iPhone	@entity75:Fair Labor Organization	@entity67:The New York Times	@entity150:Tim Carmody	@entity62:WIRED magazine
about half of settlement will go to help people of @placeholder region	@entity95	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the son of executed @entity3 writer @entity2 , spoke exclusively to @entity0 's @entity4 about @entity6 's $ 15.5 million payout to settle a lawsuit accusing the oil giant of complicity in the deaths of @entity11 and other activists . following is a transcript of the interview . @entity2 said the settlement would allow the families of the victims to draw a line under the past . q : what does this settlement mean to you and the other plaintiffs ? a : well , i think in the end it enables us to draw a line under the past and actually face the future with something tangible , some hope that this is the beginning of a better engagement between all the stakeholders in this issue . q : would your father have been pleased do you think ? a : yes , i think he was always a pragmatic kind of guy , someone who was always insistent that individuals should serve the collective at every point , and i think this is something that speaks to that . q : why did you settle ? a : because it offered the opportunity , as i said , to draw a line under the past so that we can move on with our lives and you have to remember there are 10 people involved in this plaintiff , all with varying experiences and aspirations . so we had to collectively agree what we wanted and engage with the terms and the offer on the table and it was exhaustively debated amongst ourselves , individually and collectively , and with our own attorney , so it was a very , very complicated and convoluted process and it did n't just happen overnight . it 's been a long , long time . q : according to many experts , environmental abuses continue in @entity3 . do they ? a : yes , i think ... look , there 's a separate issue ; this was a human rights violation case . already @entity6 has admitted that there are environmental challenges there and it 's committed to doing a study to ascertain what the damages are with a view to remediating the environmental problems there so already that issue has been addressed by a separate forum . but this case was purely about human rights violation . q : is this justice do you think for the @entity95 ? a : well , for the @entity97 , we were offered this and we felt that this represents some kind of restitution for what we 've suffered but more critically i think also it offers a chance for us to face the future and the community to see that . we are n't speaking on behalf of the community , these are just 10 cases . q : what does the future hold for the @entity95 people ? you say you are not speaking on their behalf but certainly you must have a feeling for them going forward ? a : yes , i think we 're part of that collective ... but remember part of the settlement gives the bulk of the settlement to a trust and that trust is going to fund some particular initiatives which are going to be development initiatives decided by @entity95 people themselves . some of the demands that we wanted in the early 90s in the @entity95 @entity134 such as using @entity95 resources for @entity95 development , i think some of the settlement speaks to some of that . q : the fund will also , one assumes fund other civil cases ? a : no it wo n't . it 's very specific , the menu of things it can achieve , it seeks to do something very , very specific . q : what are the broader implications do you think of this settlement for the oil industry and for multinationals in general , particularly in @entity3 but perhaps we should talk about @entity156 on a wider scale ? a : it very clearly sets a precedent that corporations have to be very careful when they operate in places like @entity156 ; this sets a precedent that you can be brought to trial in @entity166 for violations in @entity156 ... it took 13 years to go through the legal process but clearly before we started this , corporations felt they can almost operate with impunity but now i think the legal landscape has changed . q : but it did take nearly 13 years , consequently what sort of precedent does that really set at the end of the days ? if people did n't have your effort , as it were to call on ? a : well , i mean law is always hard won , justice is always hard won . you know unfortunately we were the templates or the precedent if you like and one never knows what impact this will have in the boardroom but certainly the headline issue is that you ca n't operate with impunity ; you can get caught and you will be taken to court and you will have to face a trial . q : why was it filed in @entity201 ? a : because of the @entity203 ; it 's an old piece of legislation which lawyers have been using to bring cases against human rights violations in foreign jurisdictions so there was that opportunity to use that @entity203 because the corporations involved were incorporated in the @entity166 and the provisions of @entity203 as its called enables aliens to bring @entity166 corporations to trial for violations in foreign jurisdictions . q : you are currently an advisor to the @entity3 government on international affairs . i 'm assuming consequently you know the government and its ministers as well . how will they react to this case ? a : i think a lot of them privately have been very supportive . they felt that this needs to be done and i think there 's also the possibility this sends a message out to the wider @entity236 that dialogue is important , that it 's a way to achieve some of the things that you actually want individually and collectively and i think we need that because of course the messages that we 're getting now are very grave messages . we do n't want a situation where violence is rewarded and non-violence is punished . the @entity95 people have always prosecuted their struggle in a non-violent platform and we fervently believe that that 's the way to go and the government is committed to dialogue and i think that 's where we need to go ; all the stakeholders have to come together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement to produce and it just ca n't be on the terms of the corporations .	@entity3:Nigerian	@entity2:Saro-Wiwa	@entity1:Ken Saro-Wiwa	@entity0:CNN	@entity166:American	@entity6:Shell	@entity11:Saro-Wiwa	@entity4:Becky Anderson	@entity156:Africa	@entity97:Ogonis	@entity203:ATCA	@entity134:Bill of Rights	@entity201:New York	@entity236:Niger Delta	@entity95:Ogoni
@placeholder reporter @entity312 writes about making her " @entity314 official "	@entity0	( @entity0 ) -- when the moment finally arrived , 86 of us stood up to utter 31 sacred words . i raised my right hand . my heart was pounding . all those years spent in public schools in @entity8 , i 'd refrained from saying the @entity9 . it was wrong to say it when my loyalties lay elsewhere . but that changed with a ceremony on a july day six years ago . and it changed me . i learned lessons about the meaning of country and more importantly , about myself . i 'd been in @entity8 almost three decades but happily retained an @entity20 passport . over the years , each time it was renewed , my green card changed to pink and white but the status remained the same : permanent @entity8 resident . i 'd lived here so long that i felt just as much @entity8 as i did @entity20 , but i had my reasons for not taking that last formal step that made my @entity27 official . one was practical -- there was a matter of inheriting my father 's property in @entity32 , @entity20 , and for a long time , that process was excruciatingly painful without @entity20 citizenship . my father knew what a bureaucratic nightmare inheritance could be , and as long as he was alive , he encouraged me to stay an @entity20 . the other reason i held back was far more personal . @entity20 does not allow dual citizenship with the @entity8 , and assuming @entity8 citizenship would effectively mean renouncing @entity20 . that felt like betrayal , a severance with the land that gave me birth and shaped me . i spent a chunk of my childhood in @entity20 . when my family finally settled in the @entity8 , i struggled to find myself . i learned to speak @entity50 well , even with a twinge of @entity53 drawl , some would say . i went to high school dances and loved my @entity55 's and even went out on dates , something i would never have done in @entity20 at that time . but i never felt fully accepted . i was always an " other " on forms that asked for race and ethnicity , before the days when @entity61 became a census category . in high school and college , i found myself fighting stereotypes and answering absurd questions about @entity20 , such as " do people live in grass huts ? " sometimes , i felt @entity8 simply did n't understand me and that everything would be better if i could just go back to @entity20 . the yearning for home and family grew stronger with age , especially after my parents moved back to @entity20 in 1985 . i felt a need to rediscover my roots , not uncommon , i suppose , among immigrant children . but every time i returned home to visit , i realized i could never feel fully at home in @entity20 anymore . i was too americanized . a memsahib , the elders in my family joked , referring to the term for @entity86 women during colonial times . that , too , is not uncommon among immigrant children . many of us feel neither here nor there , straddling two cultures as we navigate key years of our lives . in my case , i was happy to go on as a citizen of one country , a resident of another . i paid my taxes and enjoyed all the freedoms afforded @entity8 save two things . i never served on a jury and more importantly , i could not vote . i never had an electoral say in @entity20 either because it did not allow absentee voting . i hailed from the world 's largest democracy and lived in the world 's most powerful one , but was unable to take part in a free society 's most essential expression . i always felt cheated , or worse , that i was falling short . in 2004 , i covered the presidential elections for an @entity115 newspaper , and after months of excitement and intrigue i was frustrated that i could not cast a ballot on @entity119 . by then i had cleared the biggest legal hurdles in @entity20 in settling my father 's property . and so it happened that i sat down to fill out the necessary forms declaring my intent to become @entity8 . i was fingerprinted , passed citizenship tests that challenged my knowledge of the @entity128 and was finally called to take the oath in july 2008 . at the suburban @entity115 offices of the @entity131 , i scanned the room to see faces from @entity134 to @entity135 . there were people from 38 different countries there that day for the naturalization ceremony . i thought back to all the people i had met in my career as a reporter , of people who fought for freedom in lands that kept them caged , and others who clawed their way to these shores to break free . i remembered @entity150 dissenters i had met on my trip to @entity152 , and @entity154 women who risked their lives to make things better for their little girls . now , all we have to do is look to the men and women of the @entity161 , who took to the streets to oust governments that kept them down . think of how much people risk to attain the kind of freedom we enjoy in @entity8 . and how much people in our own country have struggled to rid our society of prejudice and persecution . my naturalization ceremony was testament to the @entity8 spirit . i looked around me and realized that this was n't just about the journeys people had made ; it was about the potential of all they could achieve in their new nation . i thought about the @entity8 i 'd met who worked hard , determined to achieve the @entity184 ; about how their expectations were greater than their fears . such was the case with @entity188 , who left behind gen. @entity190 's military rule in @entity191 and arrived here without a college degree or @entity50 skills . he started in construction jobs and worked his way up to become a successful businessman . or @entity198 , who fled the brutal dictatorship of @entity200 . she came to @entity8 ready to fulfill her dreams . in @entity202 , she said , she never had that chance . i thought , too , about all the @entity8 i met who inspired me to carry on in the face of adversity . they , too , championed the @entity8 spirit . @entity208 lost her @entity210 home to @entity211 , resettled in @entity115 only to lose her home again in a fire . @entity214 persevered with a smile on her face . she said she had learned that it was not possessions that made a home . @entity221 was a young cavalry scout whose arm was blown off in a roadside bombing in @entity224 . he returned home determined to make the best of life . he is the first severely wounded soldier in the wars in @entity224 and @entity154 to become an officer . @entity8 is filled with such stories . it is a nation that gives people hope . on that july day , i felt proud , and extremely lucky , to be a part of this land . i glanced at @entity236 of @entity135 , standing to my right , dressed for the occasion in a khaki suit and blue tie . and on my left stood my friend @entity242 , a photographer for @entity244 newspaper and a native of @entity246 . i wondered what they were thinking as they , too , became @entity8 citizens . did they have the same emotions i did ? was their joy tinged with the melancholy of giving up a homeland ? my eyes welled as i began the oath . " i hereby declare , on oath , that i absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince , potentate , state or sovereignty , of whom or which i have heretofore been a subject or citizen ; that i will support and defend the @entity128 and laws of the @entity8 against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same . ... " two worlds collided in my head as i drove to the @entity276 with my new certificate of citizenship so that i could register to vote in time for the 2008 presidential elections . that november , @entity8 made history with the election of @entity282 as its first black president . the election became an important part of my own history as i stepped up to a voting booth and cast a ballot for the very first time . since then , i 've come to think differently of my new citizenship . i know now that swearing allegiance to the red , white and blue gave me new nationality . but nothing can ever take away my identity or that of the 40 million other people living in @entity8 who were born in other countries . my @entity20 roots run deep , and i strive to carry with me every day the very best of two lands . that is , after all , what makes @entity8 great . what does @entity8 citizenship mean to you as we approach july 4th ? share your take in the comments section below .	@entity20:Indian	@entity27:Americanness	@entity202:Haiti	@entity276:Fulton County Courthouse	@entity115:Atlanta	@entity86:British	@entity134:Vietnam	@entity135:Venezuela	@entity152:Havana	@entity150:Cuban	@entity131:U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services	@entity119:Election Day	@entity154:Afghanistan	@entity214:Waters	@entity0:CNN	@entity236:Francisco Montiel	@entity211:Hurricane Katrina	@entity198:Darly Pierre	@entity9:Pledge of Allegiance	@entity8:America	@entity191:Chile	@entity190:Augusto Pinochet	@entity53:Southern	@entity50:English	@entity55:Levi	@entity188:Fernando Andrade	@entity32:Kolkata	@entity246:Malaysia	@entity208:Dylynn Waters	@entity242:Vino Wong	@entity128:Constitution	@entity224:Iraq	@entity210:New Orleans	@entity200:Jean-Claude " Baby Doc " Duvalier	@entity314:Americanness	@entity221:Richard Ingram	@entity161:Arab Spring	@entity312:Moni Basu	@entity184:American dream	@entity282:Barack Obama	@entity244:The Atlanta Journal-Constitution	@entity61:Asian-American
@entity10 says the group 's activists destroyed part of the famous @placeholder	@entity77	the future may be renewable , but evidence of ancient civilizations is n't always reparable . " @entity3 ; the @entity4 is renewable " was the message of @entity7 activists protesting at the ancient @entity8 in the @entity10 desert on monday . the activists placed yellow letters next to a famous hummingbird design , and now @entity10 authorities are threatening to sue @entity7 and criminally charge the activists with " attacking archaeological monuments , " according to @entity17 . the demonstration was timed to coincide with @entity20 ' @entity19 ending friday . " it 's a true slap in the face at everything @entity10 consider sacred , " deputy culture minister @entity21 told @entity17 of the activists ' decision to enter a " strictly prohibited " area next to a famous hummingbird design . " you walk there , and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years , " @entity21 told the @entity17 " and the line that they have destroyed is the most visible and most recognized of all .

president arrives in @placeholder on friday to see spreading oil slick firsthand	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- on day 46 of the @entity5 oil spill , @entity3 began to siphon oil from the ruptured undersea well to the surface , where it was flowing onto the awaiting drill ship @entity11 . as the recovery process started friday , @entity3 said it would shut four vents on top of a containment cap from which oil was still escaping into the ocean . the company hoped that closing the vents would greatly reduce the amount of gushing crude , though there was still enormous uncertainty about the ultimate success of @entity3 's latest effort to contain and recover the oil . @entity29 @entity28 adm. @entity27 , the federal government 's response manager , said estimates of how much oil is being captured or whether any leaks develop will be determined later friday . president @entity34 , who said he was " furious at this entire situation , " arrived in @entity1 on friday afternoon to get another firsthand look at the environmental damage and speak with political and business leaders . @entity34 did not provide details about attempts to seal the well , but said " it does appear that the cap -- at least for now -- is holding . " he quickly added , however , that it is " way too early to be optimistic . " officials should know more about the success or failure of the effort in next 24 to 48 hours , he said . researchers at the @entity51 have completed laboratory tests confirming that the oil gushing into the @entity5 has collected into more than one oil plume beneath the surface . the plumes are as wide as 6 miles , though their lengths are unclear , researchers said . in the past , @entity3 has denied that such large amounts of oil , which can choke fish and harm their eggs , have formed into underwater plumes . however , on tuesday , @entity3 managing director @entity64 said , " the science of the plumes hanging in the water does n't feel right . what happens is dispersant breaks the drops down into small drops and they move around and break down . " last month , @entity64 told @entity72 that the plumes likely would not remain . " oil by nature , in its own specific gravity , is n't going to stay in a plume like that , " he said . " it should rise to the surface , and then we 'll be able to attack the spill in that way . " the university , which recently discovered a second oil plume in the @entity5 , concluded that microscopic oil droplets are forming deepwater oil plumes . " these hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking , degraded oil , but associated with the source of the @entity97 well head , " said @entity89 , a professor of chemical oceanography at @entity51 . on thursday , @entity27 acknowledged " some anecdotal reports from research vessels from universities that have found dense plumes or what they believe to be plumes under the water . " " we 're in the process of taking samples and trying to figure out what they are , " he said . " they 're denser than the water , but we 're not sure whether it 's oil or not . " the cost of the federal response effort to the spill totaled $ 93 million as of june 1 , according to a friday letter from secretary of homeland security @entity116 and @entity27 to congressional leadership . they are requesting @entity120 approve a proposed provision that would make available up to an additional $ 100 million to the @entity28 . the @entity34 administration has also sent a $ 69 million bill to @entity3 for the government 's efforts to help deal with the spill . the bill accounts for 75 percent of what @entity3 owes to date , and the company has until july 1 to pay the full amount , an administration official said . oil that has already affected @entity1 , @entity133 and @entity134 is drifting steadily toward @entity135 . a new trajectory from the @entity137 issued friday forecast oil onshore as far east as @entity139 , @entity135 , by saturday afternoon . tar balls , tar patties and sheen were confirmed 10 miles from the @entity144 shoreline , and the primary oil plume , according to @entity137 , was 30 miles from @entity146 , @entity135 . @entity148 chairman @entity147 , whose district covers @entity146 , said he found tar balls the size of silver dollars and smaller while walking on the beach friday morning . he added that @entity3 did n't send cleanup crews until hours later in the afternoon . however , he said there was nothing unusual about the water , and that the beach remained open to tourists . " you ca n't help but be passionate about @entity135 , " gov. @entity160 said friday about the state 's natural beauty and the importance of tourism . what was needed now , he said , was strong leadership to get through the crisis . " you 've got to keep a cool head in order to win a hot game , " he said . @entity3 remained optimistic but again warned that the containment cap had been positioned on a ruptured well head a mile below the ocean 's surface . in a statement , the @entity177 oil giant said that the system 's ability to contain oil or its continued operation " can not be assured . " on thursday night , @entity3 completed a complex underwater maneuver . after mixed success with cutting off a damaged pipe , @entity3 positioned a cap over the ruptured well head , though the company was uncertain whether the cap 's seal would be snug enough to prevent oil from leaking out . even so , @entity192 , @entity3 's chief operating officer , was hopeful . " i think it should work , " he said . undersea images friday showed a great deal of oil still spewing from the well . @entity27 said the vents in the cap were designed to let oil escape to prevent cold water from entering and forming icy hydrates that could block the flow to the surface . only when the vents are closed will @entity3 be able to determine whether the seal on the cap is snug enough to keep massive amounts of oil from gushing into the ocean . @entity3 's progress was received with tempered applause . " the placement of the containment cap is another positive development in @entity3 's most recent attempt to contain the leak . however , it will be some time before we can confirm that this method will work , " said @entity28 lt. cmdr . @entity221 . " even if successful , this is only a temporary and partial fix , and we must continue our aggressive response . " the well may not be completely sealed off until at least until august , when @entity3 hopes to finish drilling two relief wells . " our task is to contain the oil , ultimately to eliminate the leaking well and , most importantly , to clean up the oil , defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where the oil comes ashore , so we return it to the original state , " said @entity226 , @entity3 's chief executive officer . @entity226 appears this week in television ads launched as part of a national campaign to restore the @entity177 oil company 's tarnished reputation . in them , @entity226 apologizes and promises to " make this right . " however , state and local leaders said they are fed up with the way @entity3 has approached the response . @entity1 gov. @entity246 said he told @entity34 friday that " @entity3 still has n't given the state a dime " to pay for its efforts in cleanup . " we are moving forward with or without @entity3 . " he also blasted the company for not quickly compensating those who are out of work because of the spill . " our people deserve to be fully compensated for their losses , " @entity246 said . " instead of @entity3 shelling out $ 50 million on an ad campaign that promises to do good work in responding to this spill , @entity3 should just focus on actually doing a good job and spend the $ 50 million on assistance to our people , our industries and our communities that are suffering as a result of this ongoing spill . " a @entity3 spokesman would n't put a price on the ad campaign , but said " not a cent is being diverted from the oil spill response . " protests against the oil company that sprouted this week are set to continue in several cities through the weekend . and anger continued to fester in coastal communities . @entity226 said friday that the company will establish a separate division to manage its response to the crisis . @entity3 has said that it has spent $ 1 billion so far but that it was too early to predict the ultimate financial blow . " we 've got considerable firepower to deal with the costs , " said chief financial officer @entity282 , referring to $ 5 billion in available cash , $ 5 billion in bank credit lines and an additional $ 5 billion in standby credit facilities . the @entity3 well erupted after an explosion and fire on the leased @entity293 drilling rig on april 20 that killed 11 people . the rig sank two days later , leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the @entity5 daily , according to federal estimates . @entity3 , rig owner @entity299 and oilfield services contractor @entity298 have all pointed fingers at one another for the disaster . a crew of scientists who just returned from an eight - day mission researching the underwater oil impact of the spill has found life forms near the breached well head , officials with the @entity137 said friday . the researchers aboard the 224 - foot @entity313 found " ample evidence of a lot of zooplankton , " said @entity137 administrator @entity317 . " it 's not a dead zone . there 's still a lot of life there . " zooplankton are organisms that drift through bodies of water , and many of them are not visible to the naked eye . the question , she said , is how much of an impact the oil from the @entity293 disaster will ultimately have . the researchers took underwater samples from within 3 nautical miles ( 3.45 miles ) of the well head . the scientist are trying to determine how much oil is out there , in what concentrations and where it came from , @entity317 said , adding that they " ca n't assume all the oil that is out there is from the @entity293 -- some of it may be from other sources .

a judge has already revoked @placeholder 's probation because of other similar failures	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- after missing her first day of community service at the @entity0 morgue , actress @entity2 gets a second chance to appear on time friday . " @entity2 arrived at the morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for orientation tomorrow , " said her publicist @entity7 thursday . just a day earlier , a judge rebuked @entity2 for similar failures , revoked her probation and forced her to post $ 100,000 bail . " her lateness was due to a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival , " @entity13 said in a statement . " @entity2 spoke with the supervisors at the morgue . they showed her how to get in , and everything is all cleared up . " chief coroner @entity26 said @entity2 failed to show up on time -- 10 a.m. et thursday -- to the coroner 's office . though she arrived late , @entity2 was turned away because there was n't enough time to complete her hours for the day , officials said . @entity34 judge @entity33 ruled wednesday that after @entity2 posted $ 100,000 bail for her probation revocation , she had to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week until her probation revocation hearing november 2 . @entity2 's tardiness thursday does n't mean she is turned away from the program , @entity26 said . if @entity2 shows up friday on time , she will be allowed to work and perform her community service , @entity26 said . the coroner 's office will dismiss @entity2 from her morgue duties only if she does something " terribly " wrong or shows misconduct , @entity26 said . @entity33 revoked probation for @entity2 because of her failure to comply with community service at a downtown @entity0 women 's center . under @entity33 's ruling , once @entity2 made bail the same day , the actress now must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the county morgue before her probation violation hearing next month . @entity2 , 25 , was on probation after pleading guilty in may to stealing a necklace from a @entity59 , @entity60 , jewelry store . she served five weeks of home confinement ending in june for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation . @entity2 's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests and have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests . her current probation calls for her to perform 360 hours at the @entity72 and 120 hours at the county morgue within a year . but the judge expressed anger wednesday at @entity2 's repeated probation failures . she said @entity2 posted nine absences at the women 's center since her last court hearing july 21 -- and performed , at most , only two hours of service . @entity2 's attempt to perform community service at a nearby @entity85 facility -- instead of the women 's center -- was voided wednesday because the judge said she did n't authorize that change . after the hearing , @entity13 released a statement : " @entity2 is hoping this matter will be resolved on november 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service . " @entity2 's estranged father , @entity94 , told @entity101 's " issues with @entity100 " that his daughter needs " a very , very intensive " program of rehabilitation for substance abuse . " what the judge did , she had to do , " he said wednesday . but he said jail time would not be the proper remedy . " she 's not going to be working the morgue . she 's going to wind up in a morgue if someone does n't do something to get her help , " he said . at one point during this week 's hearing , @entity0 city attorneys @entity111 and @entity113 asked the court to revoke @entity2 's probation and impose jail time because of her failure to do community service . one of the city attorneys said @entity2 " is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women 's center , which she was ordered to do . " but @entity2 's attorney told the court that the actress received " a glowing " probation report , which said that " ms. @entity2 has reached a turning point " in her behavior and maturity . the judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report , however . @entity33 remarked how the probation report showed @entity2 had excused absences from community service between september 9 and october 5 so that she could travel to @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 for work . but a psychologist 's report said @entity2 had perfect attendance for counseling every week , the judge observed . " the psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every tuesday , " the judge said . " i do n't know how she did that . " " did she go to @entity140 for five days and come back in time or go to @entity142 for five days and come back in time ? " @entity33 asked the defense attorney . " if she was gone from september 9 to october 5 , did she get beamed across the pond ? i do n't know how that happened , " the judge said . @entity2 's attorney , @entity156 , told @entity33 that she did n't know the specifics of @entity2 's psychological appointments , but the attorney said the arrangement did call for phone conferences . @entity162 added that @entity2 's work in @entity164 was done to support her and her family -- and affected her ability to carry out the community service . " because the work is out of the county , it did cause a disruption to her schedule " to do community service , @entity162 said . @entity2 's community service at the county morgue wo n't be easy , the judge noted . " they do n't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do , " @entity33 said . @entity1 's @entity181 contributed to this report .	@entity26:Harvey	@entity113:Melanie Chavira	@entity85:Red Cross	@entity111:Lisa Houle	@entity156:Shawn Holley	@entity2:Lohan	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Los Angeles County	@entity7:Steven Honig	@entity59:Venice	@entity142:Paris	@entity72:Los Angeles Downtown Women 's Center	@entity33:Sautner	@entity13:Lohan publicist Honig	@entity34:Los Angeles County Superior Court	@entity100:Jane Velez-Mitchell	@entity101:HLN	@entity94:Michael Lohan	@entity162:Holley	@entity140:Milan	@entity141:Italy	@entity164:Europe	@entity181:Carolyn Sung	@entity139:New York	@entity60:California

" by no means was the time and energy that we invested in these campaigns a waste , because through our efforts , we strengthened our sense of community and we deepened our ties with each other . and i think , in that sense , we 've moved the world to the type of world in which these types of incidents occur less frequently .

@placeholder will be moved to a @entity30 rehabilitation facility on friday	@entity3	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 rep. @entity3 on thursday continued her dramatic recovery from a gunshot wound to the brain by going outside for physical therapy , one of her principal doctors in @entity0 , @entity1 , told @entity2 . " today actually , we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy , " dr. @entity12 told @entity13 . " we gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine , " said @entity12 , speaking from outside @entity17 . " she was able to see the @entity1 mountains . " behind @entity12 , flowers left by well - wishers filled a portion of the hospital lawn . a day before she was to be flown to a @entity30 hospital , the husband of @entity3 , shot in the head less than two weeks ago at a public event , described his wife 's progress as " remarkable . " @entity33 said thursday he is hopeful the @entity1 congresswoman will make a full recovery . " i 've told her that , " @entity33 told reporters at @entity17 . " she recognizes it ... she is a fighter like nobody else that i know . " @entity3 is able to stand with assistance , but is not yet able to take steps or walk , said @entity12 , adding therapists are helping @entity3 with ways to express her thoughts and , eventually , speak . " [ we are ] holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up , " @entity12 said . " she is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted . " @entity3 , 40 , was shot in an assassination attempt and mass shooting that killed six and wounded 13 at a @entity53 grocery store in @entity0 on january 8 . the congresswoman is the only person still hospitalized after the attack , the hospital has said . @entity3 will be taken by ambulance friday morning from @entity17 in @entity0 to @entity58 . @entity3 will be flown to @entity60 , where she will receive further treatment at @entity62 , her office said in a statement . on wednesday , the public learned that @entity3 was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance . @entity33 said that while what physical therapists classify as " standing " or " steps " and the clinical definition of it are " a little bit different , " he said his wife " can bear her own weight , which is a big step , i think . just speaking for the doctors here , i think she 's made a remarkable recovery at this point . " he said he believes she has tried to speak , although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck , and believes she is aware of her surroundings , saying he can look in her eyes and tell . she will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting , he said . " every time i interact with her , there 's something quite inspiring , " he said . " we 've seen her moving her lips , " acknowledged dr. @entity94 , chief of neurosurgery at the hospital . but , he said , it 's hard to say whether @entity3 is actually trying to speak . he said @entity3 has been able to scroll through an @entity100 and interact with her husband , so she does appear to be aware of her surroundings . but , @entity94 cautioned , she has a long road ahead of her that will take months , at least . @entity33 has discussed the shooting incident with @entity3 , @entity12 said . " she can probably put some of that information together on her own . " @entity33 said he believes his wife would be proud of how the @entity0 community has reacted to the shootings . " she 's going to need to continue to be strong , " he said . " she will really appreciate the support of this community . " he said @entity3 ' family looked at several different rehabilitation facilities and liked @entity112 for several reasons . the medical team there specializes in penetrating head injuries like the one @entity3 has suffered , and its closeness to @entity0 is also helpful . @entity3 has undergone other " minor procedures " this week , @entity94 said , calling it " housekeeping . it 's really getting her to a position where she can graduate from this hospital .

@placeholder will decide his future in the next " four or five days "	@entity15	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 president @entity1 says he is disappointed that the buildup to saturday 's @entity5 final between @entity6 and @entity7 has been dominated by the coaches , and not the players . the showdown in @entity13 's @entity12 stadium has been widely billed as a battle between @entity6 manager @entity15 and @entity7 boss @entity16 . the fact that @entity15 worked under @entity16 at @entity18 has added intrigue to a match featuring two teams who won the league and cup double in their domestic leagues . both managers have made bold statements in the run - up to the match , with the @entity30 @entity15 describing the contest as bigger than the @entity33 final , while @entity34 claimed that @entity7 play more " beautiful football " than @entity6 . can @entity15 beat @entity16 to become king of @entity37 ? @entity1 , who said the final was " too unpredictable " to call , lamented the focus on the managers but suggested it may be a deliberate ploy to take the pressure off their players . " it 's not good because the football belongs to the players , not to the coach , for me , " he said in an exclusive interview with @entity0 . " but they are two big personalities ; they 've had some problems in their countries at the beginning . they won both the league and the cup , and now they come to the final and perhaps it 's a philosophy to protect the players being in front of everybody , it 's a tactic . " @entity15 and @entity16 are vying to become only the third manager after @entity64 and @entity65 to win the @entity5 with two different clubs . @entity15 won the @entity37 title with @entity68 in 2004 while @entity16 triumphed with @entity69 in 1995 . profile : @entity6 's maestro , @entity15 " tomorrow myself or @entity16 will for sure become the third man in that group , " said @entity15 .

" i think @entity6 are a very difficult opponent and i think their matches against @entity93 and @entity18 have proved that . " profile : @entity7 boss @entity16 both teams will be missing key players through suspension , with @entity7 lining up without @entity99 winger @entity98 and @entity6 lacking @entity101 midfielder @entity100 . but in keeping with the build - up to the match , @entity15 spent very little of his press conference on friday talking about his team , and far more time fending off questions about his own future . reports have linked the @entity30 with a move to @entity111 's nine - time @entity5 winners @entity13 next @entity112 said he was fully focused on the final and that " none of us can think about anything else .

about two pounds of potent cannabis found stashed in @placeholder shaman 's tomb	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- an ancient race that lived 2,700 years ago in the @entity2 may have been among the first to use cannabis for medical or religious purposes . researchers believe an ancient @entity7 shaman may have consumed or burned pot for medical or religious purposes . nearly two pounds of the plant was found stashed in the tomb of a @entity7 shaman . it was high in the chemical compounds that provide its psychoactive properties . " it had evidence of the chemical attributes of cannabis used as a drug , " said dr. @entity16 , an author of a study published in the @entity18 . " it could have been for pain control . it could have been for other medicinal properties . it could have been used as an aid to divination . " the @entity7 people were a caucasian race with light hair and blue eyes who likely migrated thousands of years ago from the steppes of @entity37 to what is now @entity39 . a nomadic people , they were accomplished horsemen and archers . @entity39 archaeologists excavating a network of 2,500 tombs near the town of @entity47 in the @entity48 unearthed the shaman 's grave , which contained the cannabis , along with a trove of artifacts such as bridles , archery equipment and a rare harp . the shaman is thought to have been about 45 years old when he died . many of the bodies recovered in the area were found in an incredibly well - preserved , almost mummified condition . the shaman , however , was a skeleton . " the deceased was laid out on the bottom of this tomb on a little bier , " @entity64 said . " this individual seemed to be very high status because of the variety and quality of the grave goods , including the equestrian equipment , the archery equipment and the large amount of cannabis . " @entity64 said no pipe for smoking the cannabis was found in the shaman 's tomb . researchers think he might have eaten the cannabis or possibly put it on a burning fire to create fumes . they do n't think it was used to make hemp clothing or rope , as some other early cultures did . genetic analysis of the plant suggests it was cultivated rather than gathered from the wild . this find is not the first or the oldest example of ancient people using cannabis , but it may be the best studied .

it was center @placeholder 's first start since admitting he had lied about an assault in @entity13	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 returned from the international rugby wilderness to score two tries as @entity4 opened their @entity6 campaign with an 18 - 9 victory away to @entity8 on sunday . the center made his first start since being cast aside after fabricating a tale of being assaulted during @entity4 's tour of @entity13 in june last year . the 21 - year - old crossed for his first five - point scores at the highest level , having made his debut in the 2009 @entity6 before causing controversy when he claimed he had been attacked outside his hotel to explain facial injuries . he later admitted being drunk and falling over a table in his room , but speculation over the incident continued and @entity27 sports paper @entity25 reported that he had psychiatric treatment following a suicide attempt . however , @entity1 scored the first try of the game in @entity32 in the 12th minute following a five - meter scrum , and powered over the line again out on the left seven minutes before halftime . scrumhalf @entity36 converted to give @entity4 a 15 - 6 lead and then kicked his second penalty five minutes after the interval . @entity40 , playing his 99th international for @entity8 , kicked his third penalty to reduce the deficit but the home side never looked like breaching the try line of last year 's third - placed team as @entity4 could afford to see @entity36 miss another attempt at goal . @entity8 coach @entity49 was left to rue defensive lapses ahead of next weekend 's trip to @entity52 , who lost 30 - 17 to @entity54 on saturday . " we conceded two soft scores , and if we do that we 're not going to beat anybody , " the @entity57 told reporters .

@placeholder , the socialite turned opposition leader , and her boyfriend among those detained	@entity29	( @entity0 ) -- a few thousand @entity1 braved police and subzero temperatures to mark the first anniversary of @entity7 's @entity6 movement at an unsanctioned protest in central @entity1 . while turnout was significantly lower than last winter 's rallies , which at one point attracted more than 100,000 people , those that came faced more serious consequences , including jail and fines of more than $ 9,500 -- nearly the average monthly @entity7 salary . hundreds of riot police cordoned off protesters who gathered next to the headquarters of the @entity7 's @entity21 security service and the former home of the @entity23 during the @entity24 . @entity25 , the popular anti-corruption blogger , and @entity27 , a leftist activist , were detained by police immediately upon arriving , as were @entity29 , the socialite turned opposition leader , and her boyfriend the activist @entity33 . all four were taken to a police station in the south of @entity1 but released within hours . police initially allowed the crowd gather peacefully , but after an hour began closing in on specific protesters who they arrested in often brutal scenes . an estimated 40 people were detained . the rally was the first major protest to not receive approval from @entity1 authorities , a sign of hardening relations between the city government and opposition leaders who refused to hold the rally at alternative locations suggested by the state . the demonstration is unlikely to breathe new life into the opposition , which has struggled to find direction since @entity58 's re-election in march . yet the turnout was arguably higher than expected given the threat of violence and fines . in the days before the rally , the state appeared to issue a warning to the demonstrators , announcing that a criminal investigation had been opened into mr @entity25 and his brother , and raiding the home of an associate of mr @entity27 . " it was very scary for me to come . i cried this morning , " said @entity73 , 52 , who did not want to give her last name for fear of getting in trouble with her employer . she said once she had arrived at the rally she had become more confident , and had dared to affix to her coat lapel a pin that read " we were at @entity84 . . . arrest me ! " -- a reference to the first major protest last year . " they say that there we do n't exist , but today we showed them that we do . their laws created by an illegitimate regime an illegitimate president are not an order for us . we are in charge here . . . we will come out on to the streets again , " she said . with no speeches or performances , the protest lacked the euphoria that coloured the demonstrations of a year ago . but those present insisted that were optimistic that change and reform would come , no matter how gradual . " over the past year , nothing particularly changed in politics . however , i think society has started thinking a bit about what needs to be done , " said @entity110 , a designer . " we need to change from within . i do n't know if there is a universal recipe . but we need to stop being indifferent and start thinking of things that are located outside our own apartments .

@entity8 superstars @placeholder , @entity4 star together	@entity3	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- eight years ago , @entity3 and @entity4 became global pin - ups for the resurgence in @entity8 filmmaking after their memorable breakthrough in coming - of - age road movie " @entity12 . " " @entity15 " reunites @entity4 and @entity3 , who became pin - ups for the resurgence in @entity8 filmmaking with " @entity12 " in 2001 . today , @entity4 and @entity3 's on - screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public 's attention , this time in @entity8 , where their latest film " @entity15 " made box - office history . it became the fourth highest - grossing film in the country 's history when it was released at the end of 2008 . " @entity15 , " approximately translated as @entity34 and @entity35 , tells the story of two rural banana farmers who , after being ' spotted ' by a crooked talent scout , gain instant celebrity in the @entity8 soccer league playing for opposing teams . but , mesmerized by women and fast cars and unable to defy their demons , they look on powerless as the dream disintegrates in front of them almost as suddenly as it arrived . the movie touches on fame , poverty and corruption , but for its makers , it is ultimately a tale of brotherhood . it was written written and directed by @entity52 , and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture @entity55 films . @entity55 was established by @entity8 's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- @entity52 ' brother @entity58 ( " @entity59 " ) , @entity60 ( " @entity62 " ) and @entity61 ( " @entity63 " ) . all three serve as producers on the film . in pictures : @entity3 and @entity68 in " @entity15 " » " originally i wanted to make a fake documentary about a footballer from a humble background who made it big and then disappeared mysteriously , " @entity52 told @entity2 . " but i told this idea to @entity75 [ @entity3 ] and @entity4 [ @entity4 ] , and they both said they wanted to play the part . i had one part and two actors . so i made up another brother and forgot about the fake documentary . " @entity52 also cast @entity3 and @entity4 -- best friends since childhood in @entity84 who were so keen to do the film the signed up before they saw a script -- against type and against their wishes . both had originally wanted to play the opposite character : @entity3 the abrasive @entity92 , and @entity4 the romantic @entity93 . they were eventually dissuaded by @entity52 who said : " i do n't want to make @entity12 2 . " the idea behind @entity55 films was conceived by @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 when the trio -- a kind of all - stars of @entity8 cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 @entity108 . the idea came out of a desire to pool their their rising bargaining power and maximize their clout in @entity114 -- and , of course , out of friendship . the company was " born out of friendship and sibling sympathies , " @entity98 told @entity2 . when @entity52 was originally writing the script , his bother , @entity58 told him thought it was perfect for @entity55 . the venture formalizes a working relationship @entity98 , @entity123 and @entity58 have had for years , but they freely admit they spend little time together . rather it is a case of exchanging ideas and honing each other 's writing over the phone and via email from all over the globe . @entity134 , for example , is currently in @entity135 directing @entity137 's follow - up to his wildly successful " @entity139 " trilogy , " @entity140 . " it would appear that the @entity8 trio have created an ideal creative environment for themselves , @entity55 has been criticized for forgetting their @entity8 heritage in the rush to embrace @entity114 . it is not a criticism they take lightly . watch @entity52 , @entity3 and @entity68 talking about " @entity15 " " i do n't care about @entity8 films , about indie films , about @entity114 films , " says @entity58 . " just good or bad movies . " yes , it 's great that we have a common background as @entity8 creators , but once you are a creator you have a common language with creators from all around the world . " for del @entity61 , the company will extend the influence of @entity8 cinema not diminish it : " we want to give @entity8 cinema , if you want to call it that , the credentials and right to exist in world cinema . " people do n't think twice when [ @entity172 filmmaker ] @entity171 is doing a movie about @entity174 called ' @entity175 . ' " but in your mind , @entity177 filmmakers are only doing @entity177 films . we 're trying to show that it 's important to have roots , but not borders . " the bittersweet drama has played to big laughs all over @entity8 and the @entity185 , but for its makers , it is not simply a comedy . " people talk about this film as if it 's a comedy but i question that , " says @entity58 . " the elements are very dramatic and actually very tragic , and the ending has a very bittersweet tone . " according to del @entity61 , the movie " says there 's a way to be comfortable with failure , and finding you 're emotionally more satisfied in failing . " failure though , is not an issue overly burdening @entity55 's " three amigos , " -- their second film , " @entity208 , " set in @entity205 , directed by @entity60 and starring @entity206 is currently being edited in @entity207 . @entity58 told @entity2 his next movie would be shot in @entity210 and @entity211 , and would be in @entity210 and @entity0 , though that too " will be a @entity55 film . " @entity52 is the only one who is unhappy , despite the unprecedented success of his directorial debut . " for me it 's difficult , " he says . " whenever i see the movie , i only see the flaws . nobody else sees them . " " not even your mother ? " asks @entity3 . " no , not my mother , " says the director . " she thinks i 'm a genius .

@entity37 officials say gangs with ties to @placeholder and @entity97 are behind the smuggling	@entity96	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 , 16 , says ecstasy is rampant in his high school , with kids often mixing the drug with meth and other substances . more than half of all ecstasy seized in the @entity13 last year was laced with meth , authorities say . " you just have to know the right person . it 's about as easy as any other drug . you just got ta ask for it , " says @entity3 , who asked that his last name not be used . " it 's easy to get . " law enforcement officials say stories like these highlight a disturbing trend they 're seeing across the country . most alarming , they say , is not only is ecstasy back after years of decline , but most of the time it 's laced with meth . more than 55 percent of the ecstasy samples seized in the @entity13 last year contained meth , according to the @entity34 , compared with 44.5 percent the previous year . and the drugs are coming in at rapid pace from @entity37 . watch ecstasy 's pipeline into @entity13 » almost 5.5 million pills of ecstasy were seized in the states bordering @entity37 in 2006 ( the most recent year for which full statistics are available ) -- an almost tenfold increase since 2003 , top drug enforcement officials say . " they drive them in . they bring them in by boat . they bring them in by plane . they bring them across by people just carrying them across their back much like the southwest border , " says @entity57 , an assistant special agent in charge for the @entity60 's northern region . because meth is less expensive than ecstasy , mixing the two saves producers money , but it also makes it more dangerous , officials say . @entity66 can cause sharp increases in body temperature and can result in liver , kidney or heart damage . when laced with meth , officials say , the combination can cause more severe harm because meth can damage brain functions , as well as lead to an increase in breathing , irregular heartbeats and increased blood pressure . the @entity83 says meth -- or methamphetamine -- is a " very addictive stimulant drug . " law enforcement officials say @entity89 countries cracked down on ecstasy production in the early 2000s and manufacturing moved to @entity37 . and now , @entity93 gangs in @entity37 have been smuggling the chemicals needed to make ecstasy from @entity96 and @entity97 , officials with the @entity99 tell @entity2 . finished pills are then pushed in vast quantities into the @entity13 , a flow that 's difficult to stop because of the vast , largely unpoliced border , officials say . those on the front lines in @entity37 and the @entity13 say they are working closely and sharing intelligence to try to stem the flow . @entity37 officials also say they have a good relationship with @entity96 law enforcement . the @entity99 have created teams across @entity37 focused on identifying the criminal organizations producing ecstasy and meth and say they have shut down 17 labs in the past year . " the labs that we 're finding now are what you refer to in the @entity13 as super labs . we call them economic - based labs , " says @entity122 , assistant commissioner of the @entity99 . each lab produces more than 10 pounds of ecstasy in one batch , he says . " it 's not your mom and pop operation . it tells me that it is criminal organizations that are , yes , more sophisticated and producing it for profit as opposed to producing it to fuel their habit . " it 's then finding its way into schools , like @entity3 's in @entity0 , @entity1 . " i have been seeing an increase in pill use among the teens in general , " says @entity142 , a counselor at @entity143 , which sponsors drug counseling and other activities for youth in @entity0 . " they do something called ' pharming ' where they throw a bunch of pills into a bowl and kind of choose or take out the pills they want .

as @placeholder capped the week by issuing a decree giving him unchecked powers	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- six months into his presidency , @entity1 has at times taken investors on a rollercoaster ride of uncertainty . events of the past week are an accurate reflection of the ups and downs that investors have been experiencing . @entity1 was front and center of the ceasefire agreement between @entity15 and @entity16 while holding court in @entity18 with the prime minister of turkey , the secretary general of the @entity21 and the @entity23 secretary of state . read more : @entity26 president 's tricky game of power @entity28 heaped praise on @entity1 , suggesting he has stepped up to the plate to rebuild @entity26 's pivotal role in the region . during the same week , after months of on again - off again negotiations , the @entity33 signed a preliminary agreement to lend $ 4.8 billion to the cash - strapped country . but @entity1 capped the week by making a power play to wrestle control of the constitutional drafting process by issuing a decree giving him unchecked powers . more from @entity44 : why @entity45 is caught in currency crisis @entity47 , professor of economics at the @entity49 , says the president " tried to seize the moment and move ahead in capturing more power . what @entity26 needs to focus on now is institution building rather than a power grab . " investors feel the same way , getting their first chance to respond sunday with the largest sell - off since january 2011 , when the protests to oust @entity61 began . more than $ 5 billion of market capitalization was wiped out during the session . read more : @entity26 's new president : @entity23 - educated islamist @entity47 described the effort to leverage the goodwill built up by the ceasefire and meeting conditions for the @entity33 loan as a " giant miscalculation " by the @entity65 leader . this move comes only ten days after the @entity74 stepped up to assist @entity26 with a pledge to offer $ 6.4 billion in loans and grants to the @entity79 's most populous country . @entity1 has met a full range of challenges since taking office and has responded with decisiveness . case in point : the outbreak of violence in the @entity88 was met with a sweeping out of the top military brass in @entity26 including field marshal @entity90 . but his biggest challenge , strategists suggest , is trying to appease members of his own @entity95 and the ultra conservative @entity98 wing . at the same time , those who pushed for the removal of former president @entity61 believe their revolution has been hijacked . @entity1 's gesture to meet with the @entity102 calmed the markets , but he has to manage the " man on the street " as large scale protests unfold tuesday . as this clash of opposing views takes place , the tough work of building a solid economic foundation gets delayed . " @entity116 reforms that need to be enacted have been at a standstill for the last few years , " says @entity112 , co-founder and managing director of @entity114 . at the top of his list is cutting down the cost of fuel and food subsidies which took the budget deficit to over 10 % of @entity124 in the last fiscal year . " you have a budget deficit that is ballooning , a current account deficit deteriorating and you have investments both local and international at a standstill , you know taking a wait and see approach , " says @entity112 . @entity114 raised $ 3.7 billion to fund a refinery operation after the uprising . the private equity group says another $ 4 billion is sitting on the sidelines waiting to see how @entity1 will play his cards this week and beyond . during the uprising , growth plummeted from over 5 % down in 2010 to 1.8 % last year and only climbed slightly to 2.6 % in the latest quarter ending in september . this means making solid calculations for 2013 will prove to be difficult for everything from @entity146 receipts to tourism visitors .

" @entity5 is thought to have been the last surviving commander of the uprising , in which @entity13 fought @entity40 efforts to send them to concentration camps . armed with pistols , some rifles and automatic weapons , and hand - made grenades , the resistance fighters attacked the @entity47 and their allies when they tried to liquidate the @entity49 in april 1943 . the @entity14 had planned to round up all the ghetto 's @entity13 in three days , but in the end it took them more than a month -- longer than some countries held out against @entity55 's armies . the @entity14 reduced the ghetto to rubble in the process of flushing resistance fighters out of their bunkers . @entity5 was in one of the last groups to hold out in the headquarters of the @entity23 at 18 @entity64 . in the final days of the uprising he was able to sneak out of the ghetto by way of the city 's sewers , he wrote after the war . he went on to fight in the @entity71 , a two - month battle against the @entity14 in 1944 , undertaken primarily by @entity73 . after the war , @entity5 became a cardiologist . in the late 1940s , he published a short history of the @entity9 in @entity2 , @entity77 , and @entity78 , called " @entity79 .

" hunger and disease were rife in the ghetto , he wrote . " people began to die of hunger in the streets . every morning , about 4 - 5 a.m. , funeral carts collected a dozen or more corpses on the streets that had been covered with a sheet of paper and weighted down with a few rocks . some simply fell in the streets and remained there , " @entity5 remembered . jews organized a local government and socialist unions , but conditions became progressively worse in the ghetto , with the @entity14 summarily executing people . nazis then began deporting @entity13 to concentration camps -- sometimes with the help of @entity13 collaborators in the ghetto -- @entity5 wrote . by that time , many in the ghetto knew the @entity14 were systematically murdering @entity13 in the camps , he recalled . he describes in detail the spring 1943 uprising , a street - by - street battle that ended with the ghetto in ruins . @entity5 's history finishes simply , listing the handful of survivors of the hundreds who fought back .

the @placeholder has suspended the pilot from the @entity76 program	@entity43	( @entity0 ) -- the leadership of @entity3 's airport fired back saturday at critics who had rallied around a commercial pilot who had posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in security . the series of videos featured scenes from inside the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) and were narrated by the pilot , who pointed out the contrast between the passengers , who were heavily scrutinized , and airport employees who just passed through a single door . the footage was posted , and later removed , from the popular video - sharing website @entity20 . " a recent @entity20 video , posted by a @entity25 airline pilot , presents false and misleading information on @entity12 's security program , " the airport said in a statement . " the video shows a door with a card swipe and suggests that access is gained to the airfield area through this door . in fact , the door shown in the video provides access only to an employee lunchroom . " the pilot who posted the videos requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue . " i was trying to bring up the obvious , ludicrous @entity43 - type of security , " he told @entity0 . the pilot said he did n't think much about posting his videos online in late november , but that within a matter of days his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove them because they were " stirring a commotion . " in its statement saturday , the airport defended its practices , stressing that there are variances in the security system based on various factors and that many layers of protection can not easily be seen . " proper and effective security requires multiple layers of systems , procedures and policies that are interlaced and constantly monitored , " the airport said . " the vast majority of the widespread layers of this security program are behind the scenes and transparent to casual observers . " a few days after the pilot posted the videos , he said , the @entity43 told him he was being suspended from the @entity76 program . as an officer in that program , the federal agency had deputized him , among others , to carry a handgun in the cockpit . the pilot said four air marshals and two local deputies then showed up at his home near @entity85 to personally confiscate his weapon . the only answer he could get from the security agency as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation , the pilot said . the @entity43 said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to " the highest ethical standards , " and said it took action because the pilot was in the program . " ( participants in the flight deck officer program ) must be able to maintain sensitive security information , " said the agency 's spokeswoman @entity95 . " as the issuing authority of credentials and firearms , @entity43 reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role . " in the aftermath of the incident , the pilot said he resigned from the program . he added that he did n't consider that divulging such sensitive information online would stir controversy . " i did n't think anything would come of it , " said the 50 - year - old pilot , a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot . " this is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security , " @entity118 , the pilot 's attorney , told @entity0 . " no state secrets are being shown here . what 's being shown here is a lack of security . " but the airport disagrees . " @entity12 is proud to both an innovator and a trendsetter in aviation security , " it said in its statement . " @entity12 meets , and in many cases , exceeds every federal security requirement .

vice president @placeholder finished second with 15 %	@entity11	@entity0 is heading to @entity1 as the politician that most democrats would choose as their 2016 presidential nominee . according to a new @entity7 / @entity6 poll , 53 % of all registered @entity3 contacted in @entity1 said they would support @entity0 if the 2016 caucuses were held today . that number far outpaces the 15 % that would opt for vice president @entity11 , 7 % who would choose sen. @entity13 and 5 % who would pick sen. @entity15 . @entity16 will be visiting @entity1 for the first time in six years on sunday when she headlines the last @entity19 . @entity11 , likewise , will be in the state wednesday to speak at a liberal @entity22 event in @entity23 . although @entity16 tops @entity11 with men and women , there is a noticeable gender split between the two politicians . sixty - three percent of women favor @entity16 , compared with @entity11 's 10 % . with men , however , @entity11 is drawing 21 % support -- a number more than twice his support among women . @entity0 to decide on 2016 around end of year on the @entity35 side , @entity33 nearly laps the field with 21 % of all registered republicans contacted in the poll saying they would support the former @entity40 governor if the 2016 @entity1 caucuses were held today . @entity42 is second with 12 % , and there is a cadre of politicians -- including sen. @entity46 , former @entity48 gov. @entity47 and @entity50 gov. @entity49 -- with support in the single digits . @entity33 and @entity42 are getting similar support with men -- 15 % and 16 % , respectively -- but it is with women that the former @entity40 governor jumps ahead of the congressman . twenty - seven percent of registered @entity35 women polled said they would pick @entity33 , compared with 8 % who choose @entity42 . as the first - in - the - nation caucus state , @entity1 is critically important to presidential hopefuls and can make or break a campaign . with almost two years until the 2016 presidential election and a little over a year before the @entity1 caucuses , most republicans and @entity3 polled have openly admitted that they are toying with the idea of running for president . the @entity7 / @entity6 poll was conducted september 8 - 10 , with 1,013 @entity1 adults -- 608 likely voters -- questioned by telephone . the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points . would @entity0 top @entity49 in @entity50 ?	@entity3:Democrats	@entity16:Clinton	@entity1:Iowa	@entity0:Hillary Clinton	@entity7:CNN	@entity6:ORC	@entity11:Joe Biden	@entity23:Des Moines	@entity48:Florida	@entity22:Catholic	@entity15:Bernie Sanders	@entity19:Harkin Steak Fry	@entity46:Rand Paul	@entity50:New Jersey	@entity40:Arkansas	@entity42:Ryan	@entity47:Jeb Bush	@entity33:Mike Huckabee	@entity35:Republican	@entity13:Elizabeth Warren	@entity49:Chris Christie
a @placeholder exclusive has stoked speculation about @entity0 as a potential vp pick	@entity24	@entity0 for vice president ? before we go @entity3 - z with pros and cons , let 's start with why @entity8 's team might have floated the @entity0 trial balloon now . if you were anywhere near a television this week you saw @entity8 getting booed at the @entity14 convention for saying he would repeal @entity15 . it was running on a virtual loop all over cable news . @entity8 draws boos from @entity14 , support from conservatives then , suddenly , an exclusive report about a black woman being considered as @entity8 's running mate pops up on the @entity24 . report sparks speculation of @entity28 ticket @entity30 sources say @entity31 is the go - to guy for a top @entity8 aide when he wants to change a narrative about his candidate . now that we 've gotten the " why now " out of the way , why not explore @entity28 the running mate . by most republicans ' accounts , at the end of this report , you will see why @entity28 will likely not be @entity8 's pick the pros there are many , beginning with the obvious : she is a black @entity30 woman , a political two - fer . and having a female on the ticket would make the influential @entity49 happy . mrs. @entity49 told @entity50 earlier this month that they have been " looking at that and i love that option . " @entity28 has never run for office but she is no stranger to presidential politics . she was by @entity56 's side during both of his campaigns . she 's an intellectual known for her powerhouse smarts and she has a good personal story . @entity28 was the only child of a black family growing up in the segregated @entity63 , whose fortitude landed her in unlikely @entity30 foreign policy circles . @entity28 is also a bit of a @entity68 woman . she is a concert pianist with a love of football . her real dream job is to be @entity74 commissioner . the former secretary of state and national security adviser would bring some needed foreign policy chops to @entity8 's ticket . the cons she was a central @entity56 administration player making the public case for the @entity83 war , warning about @entity85 's weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist . " there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons . but we do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud , " @entity28 told @entity92 's @entity91 in september 2002 . some @entity30 sources tell @entity92 say they ca n't imagine @entity8 would want to reopen wounds from the @entity56 years -- especially about what even republicans call a mismanaged war . @entity28 is also at odds with the @entity30 base on immigration , telling @entity92 's @entity103 not passing her boss 's legislation allowing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was one of her biggest regrets . last but hardly least is @entity28 's stance on abortion . she calls herself " mildly pro-choice . " this is the reason you can sum up social conservative reaction to the @entity28 trial balloon with one word : nonstarter . veteran conservative voice @entity120 , one of the founders of the @entity123 , said the notion of @entity8 picking @entity28 as his running mate would be a " slap in the face " to conservatives . while @entity120 took issue with @entity28 's position on abortion , he said she was part of those to blame for @entity30 losses in 2006 and 2008 which gave rise to the " @entity138 rebellion of 2010 . " " putting @entity0 at the top of the @entity141 short list is an insult to the conservatives , tea partiers and independents that are looking for a break with the old establishment @entity30 @entity149 that @entity28 represents , " he said . @entity150 of the @entity151 , a longtime friend of @entity8 's , bluntly told @entity92 that @entity28 's stance on abortion disqualifies her . " i love @entity0 , i 'd love to see her in any role in @entity8 administration except vice president , " @entity150 told @entity92 in a telephone interview . the issue , he said , is n't so much @entity28 -- it 's @entity8 . conservatives already mistrust @entity8 on abortion , since he was in favor of abortion rights when he was governor of @entity164 , a relatively liberal state on the issue . " it would give oxygen again to all of those concerns and doubts about whether the @entity8 administration will be there when it really counts . is it [ his abortion stance ] a preference and a conviction ? " @entity150 asked . he said putting @entity28 on the ticket would suppress conservative turnout . rice speculation stokes conservative reaction " what it would do is turn some activists and contributors into mere voters and turn some voters into fishermen , " he said . @entity187 of the @entity188 agreed . " i think the governor needs someone that undergirds his stated pro-life position because of policy positions that he 's taken when he was governor . he has since changed those positions to be clearly pro-life but to underscore that and to reemphasize that especially with social conservative voters , he has to have a running mate that has impeccable , impeccable pro-life credentials , " @entity187 said . the @entity202 , a leading anti-abortion group , already e-mailed around a clip of @entity8 during the @entity30 primary race last year saying that the running mate he would consider would be anti-abortion . " i would expect that they would all be pro-life and pro-traditional marriage , " @entity8 said in september 2011 . @entity8 was more explicit on the campaign trail in february . " my vice presidential nominee will be pro-life , " @entity8 said at a rally in @entity211 , @entity212 . despite widespread suspicion about the late - night @entity28 - for - @entity141 leak , @entity30 sources tell @entity92 some of @entity8 advisers are pushing for her -- so much so that a prominent evangelical leader told @entity92 he called the campaign last week to ask about it -- and warned that picking @entity28 would be a big mistake . @entity0 's view the @entity56 albatross and her position on abortion aside , there is one big reason @entity28 the running mate is unlikely to happen : she does n't want the job . @entity28 has said this in more of an airtight way than other contenders being buzzed about . " i can not imagine myself running for office , " she told @entity92 's " @entity235 " in january . " not because politics are so tough , but it 's just not me . " " there is no way that i will do this because it 's really not me . i know my strengths and governor @entity8 needs to find someone who wants to run with him . there are many people who will do it very , very well . i 'll support the ticket , " @entity28 reiterated on @entity50 last month . what is @entity28 's response to the @entity24 " exclusive ? " this may speak for itself : she did n't respond to an e-mail and her chief of staff told us her past comments stand , and that she is on vacation and not available for further comment .	@entity24:Drudge Report	@entity28:Rice	@entity83:Iraq	@entity85:Saddam Hussein	@entity151:Southern Baptist Convention	@entity150:Land	@entity3:A-to	@entity0:Condi Rice	@entity211:Shelby	@entity212:Michigan	@entity235:Piers Morgan Tonight	@entity8:Romney	@entity92:CNN	@entity50:CBS News	@entity56:Bush	@entity74:NFL	@entity63:South	@entity31:Matt Drudge	@entity30:GOP	@entity15:Obamacare	@entity14:NAACP	@entity103:Candy Crowley	@entity265:American	@entity202:Susan B.

new : @entity7 believes @entity1 is leading @placeholder , a @entity7 counterterrorism official says	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 , the longtime deputy to @entity2 , will take over leadership of @entity4 , according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites thursday . the @entity7 believes that @entity1 has indeed taken the helm of the terrorist network , according to a @entity7 counterterrorism official . @entity1 was widely regarded as @entity4 's de facto leader since @entity7 special forces killed @entity2 at a hideout in @entity14 , @entity15 , on may 2 . " hereby the @entity18 of the @entity4 -- and after the end of the consultations -- we declare that @entity22 dr. @entity22 ( may @entity23 bless him ) will take over the responsibility of command of the group , " the statement said , attributed to @entity4 's " general command . " it cited @entity2 's " martyrdom " and prayed " to the @entity28 to raise him to his heavens and reward him for his good deeds for us and the @entity33 nation . " @entity1 's official appointment to the terrorist group 's top post -- just a few days before his 60th birthday -- is " not surprising , " the @entity7 counterterrorism official said . " he had been the number two . it was surprising it took a couple of days for @entity4 to acknowledge @entity2 's death and this long to say @entity44 is the new leader . " one of the @entity47 's most wanted terrorists , @entity1 has played a defining role in @entity4 . he was indicted for his alleged role in the august 7 , 1998 , bombings of the @entity7 @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , @entity55 , that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others , according to the @entity58 , part of the @entity7 federal government . the @entity47 is offering a $ 25 million reward for information leading to his capture , the same amount as the reward for @entity2 . @entity1 's wife and three children were killed in december 2001 in a @entity7 attack on the family 's residence in @entity72 . asked whether the @entity7 is any closer to finding @entity1 as a result of information obtained at @entity2 's compound or from leads resulting from a recent @entity1 videotaped message about @entity2 's death , the @entity7 counterterrorism official said only , " obviously , he has been and will continue to be of high interest . " more on @entity1 at @entity0 's @entity80 blog in a nearly half - hour video released this month , @entity1 eulogized @entity2 , saying he " went to his @entity23 martyred because he said no to @entity7 . " @entity1 also criticized the " treacherous " @entity15 government and warned that @entity7 is " not facing individuals or groups but an entire ( @entity33 nation that ) rose from the ashes in a jihadi awakening to face its oppressors . " there will probably not be changes in @entity7 counterterrorism strategy now that @entity1 is leading @entity4 , the @entity7 counterterrorism official said . the @entity4 statement can not be authenticated by @entity0 , but it appeared on radical @entity94 sites known for posting similar statements and recruitment videos by other @entity4 figures . it said the group will not shift its policies and pledged its support to , among others , the @entity102 and leader @entity103 as the group battles @entity7 and @entity106 presence in @entity72 . the posting makes no mention of the pro-democracy uprisings in much of the @entity111 world that have forced the exit of some longtime leaders . @entity114 , a @entity0 terrorism analyst , said @entity1 may have a hard time following @entity2 . " @entity44 has none of the charisma of @entity2 , " @entity114 said . " he wants to inspire people , not just who are joining the @entity4 organization , but people who have never joined the @entity4 organization and are trying to launch attacks in their name . without @entity2 there anymore , they wo n't be as inspired . " former @entity127 officer @entity126 added @entity1 is " very poorly respected . " " he is seen as a difficult man to work with , " @entity126 said . " he has no sense among the work force in @entity4 , the kind of prestige that @entity2 had . " the @entity7 counterterrorism official said the @entity7 does not know whether @entity4 members have pledged their loyalty to @entity1 . born into a wealthy family in @entity136 , @entity1 is a physician and founding member of the @entity138 , a militant organization that opposed the secular @entity140 government of @entity141 and sought its overthrow through violent means . like @entity2 , @entity1 also went to @entity72 during its fight against the @entity145 , although he was there primarily to offer medical expertise . by the 1990s , he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the @entity140 government and , eventually , the @entity7 . in 1998 , when the @entity138 effectively merged with @entity4 , he sent a fax to the @entity150 warning @entity7 . three days later , august 7 , suicide truck bombers carried out the embassy attacks . the @entity4 statement thursday showed the group 's commitment to leading jihad efforts around the globe . citing @entity161 territories , @entity158 and @entity159 , the statement said @entity4 " will remain on the path of righteousness as a coherent , solid , cemented rank , with one word that will bind us together , with hearts of affinity , and under one wholesome banner , battling one enemy . even if the names may vary , there is no failing , no hesitation , no surrender .

he says @entity4 abandoned @placeholder before and the @entity12 stepped into vacuum	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- president @entity2 is seriously contemplating withdrawing all @entity4 troops from @entity5 sometime in 2014 , a senior administration official told @entity0 's @entity6 . the @entity2 administration had been considering leaving a force of at least several thousand soldiers to act as trainers and to hunt leaders of the @entity12 and other militant groups after the long - scheduled withdrawal of all combat troops in december 2014 . but @entity2 has grown increasingly frustrated in his dealings with @entity5 president @entity17 , who last month cut off negotiations about the size of the post- 2014 @entity4 military force . @entity17 objected to the @entity4 beginning formal direct discussions with the @entity12 about peace ; he regarded this move as happening behind his back and a betrayal . let 's stipulate that @entity17 can be a frustrating leader to deal with and that he can even be quite mercurial on occasions . that said , the @entity2 administration should n't be making important strategic decisions merely on the basis of whether or not its leaders like dealing with another country 's leader . further , @entity17 will be gone in april 2014 , when the next @entity5 presidential election will take place ; in only nine months , the @entity2 administration wo n't have to deal with him at all . in any case , zeroing out @entity4 troop levels in the post- 2014 @entity5 is a bad idea on its face -- and even raising this concept publicly is maladroit strategic messaging to @entity5 and the region writ large . why so ? afghans well remember something that most @entity4 have forgotten . after the @entity44 withdrew from @entity5 , something that was accomplished at the cost of more than a million @entity5 lives and billions of dollars of @entity4 aid , the @entity4 closed its embassy in @entity5 in 1989 during the @entity51 administration and then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world under the @entity57 administration . it essentially turned its back on @entity5 once they had served their purpose of dealing a deathblow to the @entity44 . as a result , the @entity4 had virtually no understanding of the subsequent vacuum in @entity5 into which eventually stepped the @entity12 , who rose to power in the mid- 1990s . the @entity12 granted shelter to @entity68 and his @entity70 organization from 1996 onward . after the overthrow of the @entity12 , a form of this mistake was made again by the @entity75 administration , which had an ideological disdain for nation building and was distracted by the @entity78 , so that in the first years after the fall of the @entity12 , only a few thousand @entity4 soldiers were stationed in @entity5 . the relatively small number of @entity4 boots on the ground in @entity5 helped to create a vacuum of security in the country , which the @entity12 would deftly exploit , so that by 2007 , they once again posed a significant military threat in @entity5 . in 2009 , @entity2 ordered a surge of 30,000 troops into @entity5 to blunt the @entity12 's gathering momentum , which it has certainly accomplished . read more : inside the @entity12 but when @entity2 announced the new troops of the @entity5 surge , most media accounts of the speech seized on the fact that the president also said that some of those troops would be coming home in july 2011 . this had the unintended effect of signaling to the @entity12 that the @entity4 was pulling out of @entity5 reasonably soon and fit into the longstanding narrative that many @entity5 have that the @entity4 will abandon them again . similarly , the current public discussion of zero @entity4 troop presence in @entity5 after 2014 will encourage those hardliner elements of the @entity12 who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the @entity4 out . it also discourages the many millions of @entity5 who see a longtime @entity4 presence as the best guarantor that the @entity12 wo n't come back in any meaningful way and also an important element in dissuading powerful neighbors such as @entity118 from interference in @entity5 's internal affairs . read related : @entity5 vet finds a new way to serve instead of publicly discussing the zero option on troops in @entity5 after 2014 , a much smarter @entity4 messaging strategy for the country and the region would be to emphasize that the @entity129 that the @entity4 has already negotiated with @entity5 last year guarantees that the @entity4 will have some form of partnership with the @entity5 until 2024 . in this messaging strategy , the point should be made that the exact size of the @entity4 troop presence after 2014 is less important than the fact that @entity4 soldiers will stay in the country for many years , with @entity5 consent , as a guarantor of @entity5 's stability . the @entity4 continues to station thousands of troops in @entity144 more than five decades after the end of the @entity146 . under this @entity4 security umbrella , @entity144 has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest . it is this kind of model that most @entity5 want and the @entity4 needs to provide so @entity5 does n't revert to the kind of chaos that beset it in the mid- 1990s and from which the @entity12 first emerged . read more : what 's at stake for @entity5 women ?	@entity17:Karzai	@entity2:Obama	@entity146:Korean War	@entity0:CNN	@entity12:Taliban	@entity5:Afghanistan	@entity4:U.S.	@entity163:White House	@entity144:South Korea	@entity165:Peter Bergen	@entity6:Jessica Yellin	@entity44:Soviets	@entity51:George H.W.

@entity5 tennis ace aggravated the injury during fourth round defeat in @placeholder	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 has been hit by a new injury setback and will be sidelined for up to six weeks , according to the @entity5 's tennis star 's personal web site . @entity1 aggravated an elbow injury as she lost to @entity8 's @entity7 in a marathon three - set match at the @entity12 event in @entity13 . a later mri scan revealed bone bruising to the elbow and she immediately pulled out of the prestigious tournament at @entity18 in @entity19 later this month . @entity1 told reporters that she had first felt the problem during last year 's @entity22 at @entity23 , but really started to feel it in the deciding set against @entity7 in a two hours 43 minute encounter . " i just felt like i could n't really extend it all the way . it was a little stuck . so it was going on for a while , but i thought it would be best to call the trainer , " she said . the three - time grand slam champion has suffered a string of injuries , culminating in serious shoulder surgery in october 2008 which saw her sidelined for nearly 10 months . she has steadily clawed her way up the rankings and was 10th seed at @entity13 , but her performances in grand slams have been disappointing and she went out in the first round of the @entity46 to fellow @entity5 @entity47 . @entity1 admitted to reporters after her defeat to @entity7 that she would liked to have moved up the rankings faster , but was still proud of her efforts , which culminated in a 21st career title on the @entity12 in @entity53 last month . " i mean , i think i 'm doing a lot better than other people that have had shoulder surgery in their careers , " she said . " some people have never come back . i do n't know . what , i 'm 13 in the world or something ? that 's a lot better than some of the girls i 've lost to in the last year , " she added . off the court , @entity1 's appeal remains as strong as ever and in january she renewed her contract with @entity69 , signing an eight - year deal worth a reported $ 70 million .	@entity22:U.S. Open	@entity23:Flushing Meadows	@entity1:Sharapova	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Zheng	@entity12:WTA Tour	@entity5:Russian	@entity8:China	@entity19:Florida	@entity18:Key Biscayne	@entity53:Memphis	@entity46:Australian Open	@entity47:Maria Kirilenko	@entity69:Nike	@entity13:Indian Wells
@placeholder coach : players talked of boycott prior to @entity40 decision	@entity17	the @entity1 's commissioner came down hard tuesday on @entity3 owner @entity2 , ordering him out of his team 's business and pushing to force him to sell over racist remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public days ago . @entity8 detailed @entity2 's punishment of a lifetime ban and $ 2.5 million fine -- the " maximum amount " allowed per league guidelines -- at a press conference eight hours before @entity2 's @entity3 were to tip off in the fifth game of a tightly contested first - round playoff series with the @entity17 . silver 's decision was met with immediate support from @entity1 owners , players and others connected to the league who have been calling for swift , firm punishment ever since @entity27 posted audio featuring the incendiary comments . " i hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to mr. @entity2 and recognizes that if he can fall , so can you , " @entity35 mayor @entity34 , a former @entity1 all - star who was tasked with leading the @entity1 players union 's efforts on this matter . @entity40 scandal : @entity8 's moment to shine under the lifetime ban , @entity2 is prohibited from attending @entity1 games or practices , stepping foot inside any @entity3 ' facility , taking part in business or personnel decisions , or having a role in league activities such as attending @entity1 board of governors meetings . silver -- who succeeded longtime @entity1 leader @entity55 in february -- also insisted he will do " everything in my power " to compel the @entity1 board of governors to " force a sale " of the @entity3 . the commissioner said " i fully expect " to get the needed three - quarters of the league 's owners -- meaning at least 23 -- to back the move , though @entity2 could fight any such move in court . if @entity40 does sell the team , he stands to profit considerably : he bought the @entity3 for $ 12 million in 1981 , and the team is now worth $ 575 million , according to @entity68 . and he 'd likely have plenty of suitors : among them is @entity73 mogul @entity72 , who spokeswoman @entity74 says is " interested " in buying the team . rather than water cooler discussions of exciting @entity1 playoff action , people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner , said @entity82 , head of @entity84 's sports law program . estimating the team may be worth closer to $ 1 billion , @entity82 added , " he may get a lot of money from the sale , but i think it will allow the @entity1 to shift their focus . " what ban means for @entity94 finances that 's what @entity3 coach @entity96 said tuesday night , commending @entity8 as " fantastic " for making " a decision that really was the right one . " while the players are n't rejoicing , they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day , he said . " they were just happy that it was a resolution , " @entity96 said , expressing hope that playing the game will be a " safe haven " for all involved . " ... we 're all in a better place because of this . " @entity3 : ' now the healing process begins ' the inflammatory sentiments @entity8 referred to came packaged in a 10 - minute recording that @entity27 said occurred during an april 9 conversation between @entity40 and girlfriend @entity115 . on the recording , a man and woman argue about photos posted to @entity120 in which she appears with african - americans . the man says he does n't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her . the sports website @entity128 on sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording . neither website has said how it obtained the recordings ; @entity115 's lawyer 's office said sunday that she did n't release them to @entity27 , while stating they are legitimate . on saturday , @entity3 president @entity137 suggested the audio was aimed at " getting even " with @entity2 over a lawsuit . @entity140 filed a lawsuit last month against @entity115 , who she said was having an affair with her husband and accusing @entity115 of going after extremely wealthy older men . @entity137 said that the offensive comments are " not consistent with , nor does it reflect ( @entity2 's ) views , beliefs or feelings . " moreover , he cast doubt as to whether @entity2 had made them , stating : " we do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered . " @entity8 expressed no such doubts tuesday , saying the @entity3 owner " acknowledged it was his voice on the tape . " asked whether the owner expressed any remorse , the commissioner said , " mr. @entity2 has not expressed those views directly to me . " moments after @entity8 's press conference concluded , the @entity3 struck a different tone . " we wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the @entity1 and commissioner @entity8 today , " the team said . " now the healing process begins . " @entity8 says he shares sponsors ' ' outrage ' there is no question that @entity40 rightfully owns the @entity3 . some observers question how comments , made privately , could serve as grounds for such punishment , including possibly forcing him to sell the team . yet while there 's no precedent in the @entity1 , there is in other sports . in the 1990s , @entity182 repeatedly suspended @entity184 owner @entity183 over racist and other controversial comments , and she ultimately sold the franchise . @entity8 said tuesday he 'd " let the lawyers " address specifics , while stating flatly , " we have the authority to act as i 've recommended . " @entity82 said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out " just based on something they do n't like , whether it was said privately or just said publicly . " that view notwithstanding , @entity1 owners universally backed @entity8 's judgment in statements tuesday . if the owners follow through on the commissioner 's recommendation to force him to sell , @entity2 could fight back in the courts . but should he file a lawsuit , @entity205 senior legal analyst @entity204 says his chances of success seem " basically zero . " @entity2 so far has n't had found support in the court of public opinion , especially among past and present players . members of his own team , the @entity3 , debated boycotting their playoff game saturday with the @entity17 , according to coach rivers . they decided against it , instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red t - shirts worn inside out , with the logos hidden . @entity8 said he talked to @entity225 point guard @entity224 ( who is also the players union president ) and other players prior to reaching his decision tuesday morning . dollars talked , too , to ramp up the pressure for @entity8 to act . over a dozen companies -- including @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 -- halted their sponsorships with the @entity3 over the remarks , @entity231 reported . speaking tuesday , the commissioner said he shares these companies " outrage , " adding " it will take some time " to get things right . @entity3 sponsors jump ship " i can understand how upset they are , and i 'll do my best to bring them back into the @entity1 family , " @entity8 said . for some , his decision to ban @entity2 was enough . both @entity248 and @entity249 announced later tuesday that they had renewed their " partnerships " in the wake of the owner 's public punishment . warriors coach @entity254 , who a day earlier urged fans to boycott tuesday 's game and said there was " a real discussion among the players " to do the same so long as @entity2 remained in charge , thinks @entity8 gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game . " i thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment , " @entity254 said of the commissioner before his team 's playoff showdown in @entity268 . " ... it was exactly what the doctor ordered . " five key players in the @entity2 uproar @entity277 : players are ' very happy and satisfied ' one man thrust into the controversy -- seemingly out of the blue -- was @entity1 great @entity277 . in the @entity27 recording , the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to @entity120 with @entity34 . " in your lousy f * * ing @entity288 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " the man says . " if it 's white people , it 's ok ? " she responds . " if it was @entity297 , would it make a difference ? " @entity297 was @entity34 's chief rival when @entity297 's @entity299 and @entity34 's @entity300 ruled the @entity1 . " i 've known ( @entity277 ) well , and he should be admired . ... i 'm just saying that it 's too bad you ca n't admire him privately , " the man on the recording says . " admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity307 ) on an @entity120 for the world to have to see so they have to call me . and do n't bring him to my games . " after the audio went public , @entity34 -- who , since retiring from basketball , has become a successful businessman and part owner of baseball 's @entity314 -- expressed dismay and insisted he 'd never attend a @entity3 game so long as @entity2 was the owner . @entity34 offered a very different tune tuesday , commending @entity8 for exhibiting " great leadership " in saying he and others " are very happy and satisfied . " " i wish i was in @entity268 , i would be at the @entity94 game tonight !

" regarding her marriage , @entity3 says , " @entity17 and i have n't hid the fact that we 've had a rough year .

" @entity3 's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a @entity23 hospital to remove the boy 's breathing tube and allow him to die . in march , the infant received a tracheotomy at a children 's hospital in @entity29 , @entity30 . he was able to go home april 21 . " by providing him with this common palliative procedure , we 've given @entity3 the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital , " said dr. @entity32 , chief of pediatrics for @entity34 in @entity29 . a @entity43 , @entity8 , hospital where @entity3 was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy , a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs . in court papers , doctors in @entity23 said there was no hope for recovery . they would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long - term breathing machine . @entity65 and @entity66 refused to accept the recommendation . the @entity69 ' daughter , @entity68 , had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications , and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son .

" the heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents ' rights ... to be in comfort of ( their ) own home , to die on @entity96 's time , " said @entity76 . the family countered assertions that @entity3 was nonresponsive , blind and deaf , she said . instead , the boy could hear the parents ' voices and look for them , @entity76 told @entity0 . the family believed that , after a tracheotomy , @entity3 could be freed from machinery . the parents said that they , rather than physicians , should make a judgment on quality of life , @entity76 said . the @entity3 case caught the attention of the group @entity112 , which funded @entity3 's transfer and treatment at the @entity34 . that hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and @entity3 underwent a tracheotomy there on march 21 . in april , @entity119 , national director of @entity112 , said he considered this a " victory over the culture of death . " he says " ( @entity3 ) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy , is breathing on his own , and is going home to live with his parents . " @entity112 is a catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia . the group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case . the @entity135 -- the hospital where @entity3 was initially treated -- in march said that " there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end - of - life care in this tragic situation " and that " the medical judgments made by @entity146 physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source . " nurses helped the family provide 24 - hour care for @entity3 in his final months . " there was always somebody by his side , " @entity76 said . the child was on almost no medication and apparently was in no pain , @entity76 said .

president @entity1 tells @placeholder " we need to stand together "	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- in the face of @entity5 threats , @entity2 president @entity1 stepped up his nationalist push , urging countrymen in a radio address " to stand together , united as one . " " there can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security , because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it , " @entity1 said monday . the remarks marked the latest in the war of words between the communist @entity5 and free - enterprise @entity2 , which split after @entity27 's defeat in @entity28 over the past six decades , small - scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders , including deadly naval clashes along the demarcation line in 1999 , 2002 and 2009 . the situation , if anything , has worsened in recent months -- stirred by the sinking of a @entity2 warship and deadly shelling of a border island . while there previously had been movement toward reconciliation , recent events have sparked demonstrations calling for @entity44 to be bolder and more defiant . @entity1 referenced such attacks as " provocations against us without the slightest hesitation " in his sunday address , saying they proved that , " if we merely let the @entity5 have its own way , national security and peace can not be guaranteed . " the president said that @entity44 had " thus far shown patience , time and again ( as it ) struggled to maintain peace . " even so , he said that now was the time for @entity2 to rally as one -- and not to back down in the face of @entity63 's threats or actions .

review the details of a court case that could impact @placeholder elections	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- september 10 , 2009 @entity1 health care address - hear the latest arguments in the debate over @entity6 health care reform . @entity7 the details of a court case that could impact @entity6 elections . purifying invention - find out how one inventor hopes to quench concerns about clean water . transcript this is a @entity17 . this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . @entity21 , @entity22 : on @entity24 , online , on @entity25 ; here , there and everywhere , this is @entity0 ! thank you for spending part of your thursday with us . from the @entity31 , i 'm @entity32 . first up : health care address @entity35 : first up , health care reform reclaims the spotlight as president @entity38 takes up the issue in a speech to @entity41 . this debate has been heating up for months , with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions . it 's an incredibly complicated issue , so we 're gon na look at some of the main points right now . some people think the country 's health care system is fine the way it is . others think it 's broken , but what they do n't agree on is how to fix it . for example , how much would it cost to reform the system , and where would that money come from ? should there be a government - run health insurance program ? and if so , how might that impact private insurance companies ? those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers . president @entity38 says he is n't the first president to take on health care , but he hopes to be the last . he 's been pushing for reform since he took office , and he believes the time for action is now . @entity6 president @entity38 : the time for bickering is over . the time for games has passed . now is the season for action . now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the @entity6 people that we can still do what we were sent here to do . now is the time to deliver on health care . @entity92 @entity35 : after the president wrapped up his address to @entity41 , the @entity93 offered a response from @entity6 representative @entity97 . the @entity99 representative , who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon , says he agrees with parts of president @entity38 's plan . but he thinks it also presents several problems . last night , he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs . @entity110 @entity109 , ( r ) @entity99 : we need to establish tough liability reform standards , encourage speedy resolution of claims , and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care . real reform must do this . let 's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines . i and many other republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance . @entity132 @entity133 , @entity22 : time for the shoutout ! @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 are all members of what governmental body ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity41 , b ) the @entity6 @entity149 , c ) president @entity38 's @entity147 or @entity148 ) the @entity146 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! along with six other justices , these people compose the @entity6 @entity149 . that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! campaign finance @entity35 : it 's their job to interpret our country 's laws , and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections , including the ones coming up next year ! it 's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates . right now , there 's a limit on that , but some people argue that violates the @entity173 . @entity174 is on the case . ( @entity176 ) from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : who is @entity179 ? @entity174 , @entity181 , @entity182 : it started small . during last year 's presidential primaries , a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-hillary @entity189 movie by an advocacy group , a non-profit corporation . from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : if you thought you knew everything about @entity179 , wait ' til you see the movie . @entity196 : but now , the @entity149 could make a monumental change in how money influences politics , deciding , in the name of free speech , whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending . @entity205 , democracy 21 , @entity207 : allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy . @entity196 : @entity205 of @entity214 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process . @entity218 : the little guy would have no role here , because the dominant force in our politics , the dominant force in @entity182 decision - making , would become corporations . @entity196 : but @entity229 of @entity230 , the group behind the anti-hillary @entity189 movie , argues that anyone pooling resources , including unions , the health industry , advocacy groups like the @entity236 , has free speech rights . @entity238 , @entity230 : i actually went out and looked for this fight , because i do n't believe the government should have the right to impede people 's entry into the process . and that 's what the @entity247 is trying to do here , squelch our first @entity250 . @entity196 : interestingly , the @entity252 agrees . a final ruling is expected in a couple of months , and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key , with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional . @entity174 , @entity0 , the @entity149 . ( @entity260 ) @entity261 @entity35 : six months ' worth of rain in two days ! that is what residents in parts of @entity266 are dealing with . this massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week , claiming more than 30 lives . in this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low - lying valley . it flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks . hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea . the country 's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods . he 's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it . @entity291 @entity292 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a rock band originally from @entity295 , @entity296 . i made my first @entity6 appearance in 1964 . 20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the @entity6 charts . and i was inducted into the @entity302 in 1988 . i 'm the @entity303 : @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 ! the @entity303 : @entity308 @entity35 : they were a rock band . now the @entity303 are in @entity308 ! a new game featuring the famous @entity303 is out this week . it lets players jam out on dozens of the group 's biggest hits . plus , it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll 's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band 's last gig . that 's not the only reason the @entity303 are back in the spotlight . all 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves . purifying invention @entity35 : meanwhile , a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own . but we 're not talking about digital , we 're talking liquid . more than a billion people around the globe do n't have access to clean drinking water . sure , there 're water water everywhere , but if it 's not clean , it can cause serious consequences . @entity344 looks at one idea designed to quench the problem . ( @entity176 ) @entity344 , @entity0 correspondent : water : it 's the most abundant resource on the planet , yet every year , millions of people die because they do n't have access to clean water . so @entity353 , the inventor of the @entity354 , decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the " @entity357 . " @entity353 , inventor : we believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem : bad water . @entity366 : he says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling , distilling and vaporizing it . @entity373 : in goes the bad , and as you can see , out comes the good . that is pure water . @entity366 : the machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems , making it more portable . @entity373 : it 's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world . @entity366 : @entity353 says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function . but until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down , @entity386 wo n't be available to the people who need them most . @entity373 : we 've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water , that we 've all come to take for granted , but we 'll not be able to do that in the future . @entity366 : @entity344 , @entity0 . ( @entity260 ) before we go @entity35 : before we leave you today , we 've got a story about something that 's pretty darn fast . @entity401 may be the quickest person on the planet , but he 's got nothing on @entity404 . the cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world 's fastest land mammal . she made the 100 - meter dash in 6.16 seconds . then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt . now for reference , sprinter @entity412 did it in 9.58 seconds . so , cheetah wins . think you could outrun her ? you 're welcome to give it a shot . goodbye @entity35 : but you 've got to make sure that she does n't break any rules . after all , she 's a cheetah . okay , we know a lot of you probably saw that coming , but you just ca n't miss the opportunity to make a cheetah pun . it 's where we cross the finish line for today , but we 'll be back tomorrow to close out the week . we look forward to seeing you then . for @entity0 , i 'm @entity32 .	@entity22:CNN STUDENT NEWS	@entity17:RUSH TRANSCRIPT	@entity21:CARL AZUZ	@entity99:LOUISIANA	@entity24:HLN	@entity25:iTunes	@entity404:Sarah	@entity401:Usian Bolt	@entity250:Amendment Rights	@entity252:American Civil Liberties Union	@entity373:KAMEN	@entity110:REP.	@entity135:Stephen Breyer	@entity354:Segway	@entity137:Clarence Thomas	@entity136:Anthony Kennedy	@entity357:Slingshot	@entity133:GEORGE RAMSAY	@entity132:Shoutout	@entity214:Democracy 21	@entity1:Quick Guide	@entity0:CNN Student News	@entity7:Campaign Finance-Review	@entity6:U.S.	@entity176:BEGIN VIDEO CLIP	@entity179:Hillary Clinton	@entity196:QUIJANO	@entity238:DAVID BOSSEE	@entity218:WERTHEIMER	@entity92:Health Care Response	@entity353:Kamen	@entity295:Liverpool	@entity296:England	@entity291:I.D.

created by @entity10 businessman @placeholder , the @entity5 has over 12,000 installed classes	@entity9	whether it 's learning how to read and write or setting up your own farm , a @entity4 computer tablet -- known as the @entity5 -- is trying to open up the country 's information highway . the brain child of @entity10 tech entrepreneur @entity9 , the @entity5 principally teaches users basic numeracy and literacy skills , aimed at primary school children . " it became clear that there was a huge need for this kind of technology , " @entity9 said , " particularly tablet technology , which has come a long way in @entity22 in recent years . " after arriving in @entity4 30 years ago under the @entity23 , @entity9 worked in the computer department at the country 's national university for over a decade before deciding to go it alone . " we can really do something very major for the first time , " he said . " we 've invested about $ 5 million to date ... it 's totally all - encompassing and quite prescriptive so we are aiming at being able to get to an untrained teacher in a deep rural area in the @entity22 bush . " interactive learning the @entity5 is programmed in eight different languages native to @entity4 with over 12,000 preloaded classes and lesson plans for untrained teachers in rural areas , according to @entity9 . approved by the @entity4 @entity42 , the educational tablet allows children to create a personal profile on its seven - inch screen to keep track of their progress as well as exposing them to e-mail and @entity49 . @entity9 said the @entity5 is set up to teach grades one to seven through interactive learning in every subject from math to @entity54 , art and music . the technology comes at a time when @entity4 's educational system is undergoing sweeping changes . since 2001 , the government has increased primary school enrollment rates by 90 % . as a result , the @entity63 has identified the landlocked southern @entity22 nation as having one of the most improved primary school education systems in the developing world . @entity9 added : " for years there was a problem with funding , education was not keeping up with population growth . young people coming out of school and not being well suited or prepared to enter the job market ... . we 're trying to change that . " the @entity5 gives children a grasp of vital technology skills in a landlocked country where broadband is scarce and only 18 % of the nation 's 14 million people have access to electricity , according to the @entity63 . in addition to following the national curriculum , the tablet also contains farming and health information designed for adults to help prevent the spread of killer diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria . outsourcing to @entity98 the @entity99 is currently manufactured , assembled and branded in @entity98 . the devices are then loaded onto a plane and transported to @entity4 , where @entity9 and his team install the software onto each tablet . " it costs roughly $ 100 to have them made and landed here in this country , " @entity9 said . " we sell them to teachers and schools for $ 200 at the moment . we hope to bring that price down . one of the other things we 're trying to do is provide significant tech support .

astronaut @entity4 is an @entity9 - born son of @placeholder immigrants	@entity12	( @entity0 ) -- for astronaut @entity4 , his first space flight , scheduled to be aboard the space shuttle discovery , marks a remarkable journey from the farm fields of @entity7 to the skies . astronaut @entity4 is an @entity9 - born son of immigrants from @entity11 , @entity12 . @entity4 , an @entity9 - born son of immigrants from @entity11 , @entity12 , is getting plenty of attention at home and abroad for his journey from working the fields to operating some of the most advanced mechanics on the space shuttle . @entity12 president @entity20 called the 47 - year - old astronaut over the weekend to congratulate him . a transcript of the entire conversation was promptly posted online by the @entity12 government . @entity4 is also reaching out to fans through @entity26 , where he posts updates under the name " @ @entity29 -- @entity4 . " " i come from a very humble family and what i would call a typical migrant farm working family , " @entity4 said in a @entity31 interview . as a child , @entity4 's family split their time between @entity12 and @entity7 , where they worked as migrant farm workers . during the school year his parents emphasized his education , but on the weekends @entity4 would help the family , he said in the interview , posted on the @entity31 web site . growing up in @entity47 , @entity7 , it was @entity4 's job as the youngest child to hold up the rabbit ear antennas on the family 's television set in order to get the best reception while everyone watched the @entity57 missions . " now i kid around with my family saying that , you know , it was through osmosis that i became an astronaut because i was closest to the whole situation , " @entity4 told @entity31 . the real catalyst for his dream to become an astronaut , however , came when @entity68 , became the first @entity9 astronaut in 1981 . " there was a lot of parallels and that 's when i challenged myself . @entity74 said , " hey , if @entity68 can do it , why ca n't i do it ? " @entity4 said in the interview . @entity4 earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering , and before joining @entity31 worked on a number of high - tech projects , including an x-ray laser to be deployed in space , a digital mammography system and the disposal of excess nuclear material in @entity89 , his official biography states . according to @entity31 , there are nine hispanics currently in the astronaut program , and 13 total in the program 's history . astronaut @entity97 , also of @entity12 descent , will also fly on @entity100 's upcoming 13 - day mission . the scheduled launch of @entity100 on tuesday was scrubbed twice , once because of weather and then hours later because of of mechanical issues involving a drain valve . @entity31 did not announce a new launch schedule .	@entity31:NASA	@entity20:Felipe Calderon	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:California	@entity12:Mexican	@entity11:Michoacan	@entity4:Hernandez	@entity9:American	@entity29:Astro	@entity100:Discovery	@entity47:Stockton	@entity57:Apollo	@entity68:Franklin	@entity74:I	@entity97:Danny Olivas	@entity89:Russia	@entity26:Twitter
his death comes amid tension between the @entity20 and @placeholder over adoptions	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- officials in @entity2 said monday they are investigating the " suspicious " death of a 3 - year - old boy , adopted from @entity5 , and a @entity5 official blamed the death on " inhuman abuse . " the boy was born on january 9 , 2010 , and died on january 21 , 2013 , according to @entity10 , the @entity11 's special representative for human rights . " i would like to draw your attention to another case of inhuman abuse of a @entity5 child by @entity20 adoptive parents , " he said in a statement . @entity10 claimed the child suffered injuries to his head and legs , as well as to his abdomen and internal organs . the wounds , he said , " could only be caused by strong blows . " @entity28 , an investigator with the @entity30 's office , said the case was referred to his office because of the " suspicious " nature of the child 's death . @entity36 , of @entity37 , said his office is investigating . the allegations include physical abuse and neglectful supervision , or neglect , he said . sgt. @entity42 , spokesman for the @entity43 , said his office is also investigating . no arrests have been made , and officials are waiting for autopsy results , he said . a call seeking comment to a number listed for the boy 's adoptive parents was not immediately returned . a voice message told reporters the parents would have no comment . the child 's death comes amid tension between the @entity20 and @entity5 over adoptions . @entity61 spokeswoman @entity60 said monday that officials are aware of the case . " the @entity61 takes very seriously the welfare of children , particularly children who have been adopted from other countries , " she said . " we will continue to assist the @entity69 and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in @entity2 . " in december , @entity5 president @entity73 signed into law a measure that would ban the adoption of @entity5 children by @entity20 families . it is scheduled to take effect in january . the action could affect hundreds of @entity20 families seeking to adopt. @entity20 adopted close to 1,000 @entity5 children last year , according to @entity61 figures . though the number has been dropping in recent years , @entity5 remains the third most popular foreign country -- after @entity87 and @entity88 -- for @entity20 foreign adoptions . the @entity5 measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity20 , if such activities could affect @entity5 interests , @entity5 's semiofficial @entity90 news agency said . and it imposes sanctions against @entity20 officials thought to have violated human rights . the move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that @entity20 president @entity104 signed into law on december 14 . that law , called the @entity107 , imposes @entity20 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity5 . the @entity107 is named for @entity5 lawyer @entity111 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state . @entity111 was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a @entity122 detention center . backers of the @entity5 bill said @entity20 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing what they say are 19 deaths of adopted @entity5 children since the 1990s . the @entity5 public supported the bill , with 56 % of respondents in a poll conducted by the @entity132 ( @entity133 ) saying they backed the ban , @entity90 reported . in 2010 , an @entity20 woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity5 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety . @entity0 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .	@entity20:United States	@entity28:Kim Herrington	@entity111:Magnitsky	@entity87:China	@entity88:Ethiopia	@entity133:FOM	@entity132:Public Opinion Foundation	@entity2:Texas	@entity0:CNN	@entity11:Russian Foreign Ministry	@entity5:Russia	@entity10:Dolgov	@entity73:Vladimir Putin	@entity30:Ector County Medical Examiner	@entity37:Texas Child Protective Services	@entity36:Patrick Crimmins	@entity69:Russian Embassy	@entity104:Barack Obama	@entity107:Magnitsky Act	@entity122:Moscow	@entity90:RIA Novosti	@entity144:Elise Labott	@entity143:Chandler Friedman	@entity42:Gary Duesler	@entity43:Ector County Sheriff 's Office	@entity60:Victoria Nuland	@entity61:U.S. State Department
president @placeholder touches on @entity26 , @entity99 conflict , wars in @entity28 , @entity29	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- president @entity1 delivered his long - awaited and wide - ranging speech thursday on @entity4 and @entity5 relations , offering a hand of friendship to @entity8 and addressing an array of quandaries and conflicts dividing the two cultures . president @entity1 urges a new chapter in ties between the @entity4 and @entity5 in a speech thursday in @entity16 , @entity17 . at @entity17 's @entity18 , @entity1 quoted from the @entity19 as he expounded on @entity8 's glories and rights , the legitimate rights of @entity23 and the @entity24 , @entity26 nuclear aspirations , the wars in @entity28 and @entity29 , women 's rights , economic development , and religious rights and democracy in the @entity5 world . the address , billed as a fence - mending mission between the @entity4 and @entity8 , urged those present and the people across the globe viewing the speech on television to enter a new , productive and peaceful chapter in their relationship . @entity1 's stop in @entity17 is part of a trip that started in @entity46 on wednesday and will continue later to @entity47 and @entity48 . watch @entity1 's entire speech » " i know there are many -- @entity5 and @entity53 -- who question whether we can forge this new beginning , " @entity1 said , emphasizing that " it is easier to start wars than to end them . it is easier to blame others than to look inward , to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share . " @entity1 reiterated a statement he made in @entity64 in april . " in @entity65 , i made clear that @entity4 is not -- and never will be -- at war with @entity8 . " we will , however , relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject : the killing of innocent men , women and children . and it is my first duty as president to protect the @entity4 people . " @entity1 explored the @entity24 and @entity23 conflict , endorsing a two - state solution and urging compromise and understanding between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations . " ireport.com : a reaction to @entity1 's speech and then he entered into the conflict 's thickets , understanding claims from both sides . he said the @entity4 " does not accept the legitimacy of continued @entity23 settlements " seen by @entity5 as impediments to @entity99 peace . watch as @entity1 seeks a " new beginning " » " this construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace . it is time for these settlements to stop . " calling @entity4 's " strong bond " with @entity23 " unbreakable , " he said , " it is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a @entity113 homeland is rooted in a tragic history that can not be denied . " he denounced the denial of the holocaust and anti-semitic stereotyping , and criticized anyone who would threaten @entity23 's destruction . expounding on the plight of @entity24 , @entity1 said " it is also undeniable that the @entity24 people -- muslims and @entity124 -- have suffered in pursuit of a homeland . " " for more than 60 years they have endured the pain of dislocation . many wait in refugee camps in the @entity132 , @entity133 and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead , " he said . watch @entity1 discuss the @entity23 - @entity24 conflict » " they endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation . so let there be no doubt : the situation for the @entity24 people is intolerable . @entity4 will not turn our backs on the legitimate @entity24 aspiration for dignity , opportunity and a state of their own . " @entity1 also denounced @entity24 violence and the rejection by some of @entity23 existence -- both seen by @entity23 as obstacles to peace . the president conjured the lessons of @entity4 's civil rights movement when he urged @entity24 to " abandon violence . " " resistance through violence and killing is wrong , and it does not succeed . for centuries , black people in @entity4 suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation , " he said . " it was not violence that won full and equal rights . it was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of @entity4 's founding . " the conflict , @entity1 said , needs to be seen from a larger perspective , not from the viewpoint of one side or another . and both sides must live up to the responsibilities of the moribund " road map " peace process , he said . watch @entity0 's @entity191 on @entity1 's message of detente » he added that the @entity195 movement -- which controls @entity133 -- and has some support among @entity24 must end violence and recognize past agreements . he also urged @entity200 states to no longer use the conflict to distract their peoples from other problems . " the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states , where @entity23 and @entity24 each live in peace and security , " he said . @entity1 talked about the importance of confronting violent extremism , touching on the fight against the @entity215 and @entity216 after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity4 . emphasizing the fact that the @entity4 entered @entity29 by " necessity " and not " choice , " he countered the stances of some " who " question or justify the events of 9/11 . " " but let us be clear : @entity216 killed nearly 3,000 people on that day . the victims were innocent men , women and children from @entity4 and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody . and yet @entity216 chose to ruthlessly murder these people , claimed credit for the attack and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale . they have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach . these are not opinions to be debated ; these are facts to be dealt with , " he said . @entity1 said the @entity4 does not seek to keep its troops in @entity29 or establish military bases there but needs to continue the fight against " extremists , " with both military power and investment in the infrastructure and economy of @entity254 and @entity29 . " it is agonizing for @entity4 to lose our young men and women . it is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict . we would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in @entity29 and @entity254 determined to kill as many @entity4 as they possibly can . but that is not yet the case , " he said . he addressed the conflict in @entity28 , calling it unlike @entity29 " a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world . " " although i believe that the @entity28 people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of @entity277 , i also believe that events in @entity28 have reminded @entity4 of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible , " he said . he said the @entity4 needs to help @entity28 " forge a better future and leave @entity28 to @entity28 . " " i have made it clear to the @entity28 people that we pursue no bases , and no claim on their territory or resources . @entity28 's sovereignty is its own . that is why i ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next august . that is why we will honor our agreement with @entity28 's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from @entity28 cities by july , and to remove all our troops from @entity28 by 2012 . " speaking about prohibiting torture and the closing of the @entity306 , @entity307 , detention facility , @entity1 talked about working on " concrete actions to change course " and correct abuses in the war on terror . " just as @entity4 can never tolerate violence by extremists , we must never alter our principles . @entity316 was an enormous trauma to our country . the fear and anger that it provoked was understandable , but in some cases , it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals , " he said . @entity1 dwelled on the tensions over nuclear weapons between the @entity4 and @entity26 and the " tumultuous history " between the countries . he pointed to the @entity4 role in overthrowing a democratically elected government during the @entity332 era and @entity26 's role in hostage - taking and violence against @entity4 troops and civilians since the @entity8 revolution in 1979 . the president reiterated his desire to move forward with @entity26 on many issues , saying the " question , now , is not what @entity26 is against , but rather what future it wants to build . " " but it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons , we have reached a decisive point . this is not simply about @entity4 's interests . it is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the @entity99 that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path . " the @entity4 and other @entity358 nations have opposed what they believe are @entity26 's intentions to develop nuclear weapons . @entity1 said that any nation , including @entity26 , " should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the @entity366 . " he said such a " commitment " is at the treaty 's core and " it must be kept for all who fully abide by it . " " and i am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal , " @entity1 said .	@entity23:Israel	@entity26:Iran	@entity99:Mideast	@entity24:Palestinians	@entity28:Iraq	@entity29:Afghanistan	@entity113:Jewish	@entity358:Western	@entity332:Cold War	@entity277:Saddam Hussein	@entity133:Gaza	@entity132:West Bank	@entity215:Taliban	@entity1:Obama	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Muslims	@entity4:America	@entity195:Hamas	@entity8:Islamic	@entity191:Christiane Amanpour	@entity53:non-Muslim	@entity17:Egypt	@entity16:Cairo	@entity216:al Qaeda	@entity19:Quran	@entity18:Cairo University	@entity366:nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty	@entity124:Christians	@entity200:Arab	@entity306:Guantanamo Bay	@entity307:Cuba	@entity316:9/11	@entity46:Saudi Arabia	@entity47:Germany	@entity254:Pakistan	@entity64:Turkey	@entity65:Ankara	@entity48:France

thursday was one of the bloodiest days in the @placeholder conflict	@entity4	( @entity0 ) -- diplomats sought new ways to forge peace in @entity4 on friday as the killings continued in the restive land . @entity7 , the special envoy to @entity4 for the @entity8 and the @entity9 , urged countries to use their pull on the combatants to stop the fighting . he is also planning an international meeting to discuss next steps on @entity4 . " it is time for countries of influence to raise the level of pressure on the parties on the ground and to persuade them that it is in their interest to stop the killing and start talking , " @entity7 said in @entity16 , @entity17 . " i urge all parties to heed the call for a cessation of violence in all its forms , first and foremost for the sake of the @entity4 people , the children and women in particular . i think they have suffered for far too long and continue to suffer . but if our efforts are to succeed , we shall need the united and sustained support of the international community . this is essential . " the diplomatic wrangling comes as violence continues to rage across the country . since the uprising began in march 2011 , violence has killed more than 15,000 people in @entity4 , mostly civilians , according to the @entity52 . the @entity9 has said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict . at least 128 people died thursday in one of the deadliest days of the 15 - month conflict , and another 87 deaths have been recorded friday , the opposition @entity55 said . thirteen people died in @entity61 , 11 in @entity62 and 10 in the @entity64 suburbs . the @entity55 said that more than 10 massacres have occurred in the past few days , including recent ones in @entity67 and @entity68 . @entity69 also emerged friday of a recent mass killing and constant shelling in @entity72 , in @entity62 province . @entity4 state - run tv says " armed terrorist gangs " kidnapped " innocent civilians " and " desecrated their bodies , " an act it describes as a " barbaric massacre " in the area . it said that more than 25 people have been killed . the opposition @entity52 said 26 people shot and killed in the area were members of a pro-government militia called the @entity88 , who are themselves blamed for killings of civilians . @entity4 consistently blames terrorists for the violence . opposition groups say the violence began when a government crackdown on peaceful protesters generated a nationwide uprising . @entity0 can not confirm specific reports of violence in @entity4 because the government has restricted access to the country by international journalists . @entity7 and maj. gen. @entity104 , the head of the suspended @entity9 observer mission in @entity4 , described a bleak scenario to reporters in @entity16 , @entity17 . @entity7 said that in the past few days , he has been in " intensive consultations with a number of ministers and officials in capitals around the world about the possibility of convening a meeting of ministers to discuss what further actions could be taken to implement the @entity120 resolutions . " " we can not just step back and do nothing , and this is why i say , if we have alternatives , let 's go with it , " @entity7 said . @entity7 favors the inclusion of @entity128 in such a meeting . " the composition of the group will be such that i hope that apart from @entity120 members , the permanent members of the @entity120 , it will include governments and countries with influence on one or the other parties , coming together and deciding that they will cooperate and work together , realizing that it is only when the international community comes together and sustains its pressure and effort that we get results . today , honestly speaking , that is not happening , " he said . @entity7 was asked what actions he would like to see taken at the upcoming conference . " we either have to find ways of getting the plan implemented , if we think it is still worthwhile pursuing it , and if the plan is not worthwhile , what other options are we going to look at and begin to take a look at them , " he said . " there may be recommendations emanating from the group that the council would want to act on , but they as a group will not take that kind of decisions . i hope they will decide to use their collective influence on the parties to push them in the right direction as well as perhaps coming up with ideas that the council can work on . " both men discussed the deteriorating humanitarian situation . @entity7 said that up to 1.5 million people are affected somehow by the warfare . he said that at least 92,000 people have fled to other countries in the region . @entity104 said the " level of destruction " is massive in violence - stricken flashpoints , such as neighborhoods in @entity61 , @entity181 and @entity182 . " i am also particularly concerned about the continued military occupation of hospitals , health facilities and schools , also preventing access to medical attention for those in need . which means the need for the humanitarian response plan to be effective and the scale of rebuilding and reconstruction that is before us once there is a cessation of violence is enormous , " he said . the @entity203 said one of its teams tried to enter neighborhoods in @entity61 to help people caught in the crossfire , but @entity104 said " civilians continue to be trapped in the line of fire . " " there is a need to call on all parties when they are pursuing their objectives by military means to distinguish very clearly between civilians and combatants . it is not always easy . and all parties must abide by the obligation to keep civilians out of harm 's way . and obviously it is the government that has the primary responsibility to civilian populations to protect them from all forms of violence . the latest attempts by the ( @entity229 ) and the @entity203 to have a breakthrough related to evacuating the civilians -- children , women , elderly -- out of @entity61 have regrettably not yet succeeded , " @entity104 said . mood has been leading a mission to monitor what is a failed cease - fire and the government 's adherence to a six - point peace plan that has not taken hold . but the mission had to be suspended because of rising violence . he said the observers are still in @entity4 and are conducting administrative activities . the @entity55 said that more than 3,600 people have died since the @entity7 plan began this year . " the observers in @entity4 , at the moment , they are mainly in their team sites and at headquarters , " @entity104 said . " that does not mean that we are doing nothing . it means that , from their team sites , they have view of surrounding areas , the cities . we are also continuing the engagement by telephone with the different parties , and we also have some patrols going to local hospitals and assessing the situation . so the normal administrative activities are ongoing , but patrols and exploring new areas and going into new projects is not on the agenda while the activities are suspended . obviously , given the fact that the mandate is for 90 days and that it does n't expire until the 20th of july , my focus is to be able to continue to implement the mandated tasks as soon as the situation allows . and a less risky level of violence makes that possible . " @entity7 said the observers are " keen to resume their work . " " in the short time that they have been there , they have engaged not just with the parties but with communities at all levels of society in the cities and towns where they have been deployed , " @entity7 said . " their commitment to the @entity4 people has not faltered . but the circumstances must allow them to do their work . and we all know that they are unarmed men and women who are doing courageous work . " @entity7 has n't lost hope about the mission . he said he 's seen other situations where plans are implemented and progress is reached after long delays . " i have seen situations where plans have not been implemented for a while , and then suddenly there are shifts , shifts take place on the ground in strategic alliances , and you can see progress . and i hope we can see some of the positive shifts in positions of government , their willingness to pressure , or to take certain actions to give us movement , " he said . @entity7 was asked when he 'll know the crisis will spiral out of control . " if it does continue to escalate , there will come a moment when not only the @entity9 but everybody will see very clearly that the situation is not sustainable , is not controllable and is beyond control of everyone . and we do n't want to get there . his is why we are trying to press and push to see if we can get the parties to take steps to end the violence before we get to that stage . i do n't think we are there yet , but we may not be far from there . " meanwhile , @entity342 's foreign minister says @entity4 leaders are ready to work with the rebels to synchronize a pullout of forces . @entity342 is a friend of @entity4 's , and world powers believe that it has tremendous pull with president @entity351 's regime .

@placeholder is one of the richest men in the world	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- he played the ukelele , weighed in on the @entity4 debacle and even flashed his prehistoric flip cell phone . suffice it to say , we got to see another side of @entity9 during an interview with @entity11 tuesday night . accompanied by his son and grandson , the billionaire investor gave his unique take on almost everything . and with that , he let @entity11 and @entity18 take a quick peek in his wallet . literally . here are some of the highlights . on @entity4 and @entity23 @entity9 has in the past supported president @entity25 . and it seems that this support extends to embattled @entity18 secretary of health and human services @entity23 . @entity9 says give @entity23 some time to fix the @entity4 mess she is overseeing . " i am a friend of @entity23 's . and i 'm a friend of her when she 's in trouble . i like @entity23 . i feel sorry for her in the position she 's in . obviously , it 's a huge screw up but it will get worked out , " @entity9 told @entity11 . on technology can you tell a lot about the wealth of a man from his cell phone ? apparently not when it comes to the 83 - year - old financial guru . " this is the one @entity48 gave me , " joked @entity9 , as he revealed a @entity44 flip phone , a relic compared to today 's smartphones . " i do n't throw anything away until i 've had it 20 or 25 years . " by the way , @entity9 's son , @entity50 , did not bring a phone to the interview . and grandson @entity54 led the three generations when it came to technology . he had two @entity58 . @entity9 's standoffish approach to technology extends to e-mail . " i sent one e-mail in my life , " revealed @entity9 . " i sent it to @entity65 at @entity66 and it ended up in court in @entity68 , so i am one for one . " on his biggest mistake when you are one of the richest people in the world , it is hard to say you made many mistakes . @entity9 listed one . " i bought a company in the mid- 90s called @entity77 and paid $ 400 million for it , " @entity9 said . " and it went to zero . and i gave about $ 400 million worth of @entity80 stock , which is probably now worth $ 400 billion . but i 've made lots of dumb decisions . that 's part of the game . " on his wallet @entity9 says he has been carrying the same wallet for 20 years . and when @entity11 asked @entity9 to show @entity18 what is inside , he obliged . he whipped out the black wallet for a split second . if you blinked you missed it . the highlights : a family picture . a wad of hundreds . and an @entity98 card from 1964 . " it goes with the cell phone , " @entity9 joked about the almost 50 - year - old credit card . on the shutdown showdown at least one part of the recent battle between @entity105 and @entity106 that caused a 16 - day government shutdown should never happen again , @entity9 says . the battle should not take place around whether to raise the debt ceiling limit , he said . it could be catastrophic to the economy . " i think that both parties should declare the debt limit as a political weapon of mass destruction which ca n't be used , " he said . " i mean , it is silly to have a country that has 237 years building up its reputation and then have people threaten to tear it down because they 're not getting some other matter . " on investment who would n't ask the " @entity9 , " who made his fortune investing , for a stock tip ? fans watching the interview needled @entity11 via @entity129 to ask the @entity131 billionaire how he would invest $ 1,000 right now . @entity9 's answer : " well you asked , " he coyly told @entity11 .

" what caused the credit crisis was just dumb lending . when you lend money to people who ca n't pay you back , you go broke . " looking ahead to 2013 , @entity6 says the biggest risk to global growth is the @entity4 hitting the debt ceiling -- whether in the short - or long - term .

" that spark , the way it was in the past , is no more , " said @entity31 . last fall , a judge in @entity0 's high court declared the mujra dance " vulgar " and banned it from being performed on stage . some here say the government is cracking down on easy , " immoral " targets in an attempt to appease religious hard - liners like the @entity44 . @entity46 militants are believed to be responsible for a recent wave of bomb attacks in @entity0 , targeting cinemas , theaters and cafes where young men and women fraternize together . " it is a gesture of good will to pacify the mullahs and the @entity44 , " said @entity54 , a lawmaker in the provincial assembly . though she is a member of an opposition political party , she said she supported the crackdown on vulgarity .

" of course you might live an easier life if you abandon some rights . but there are so many injustices , and limited educational resources , " @entity1 told the @entity16 's @entity15 newspaper . " they all diminish happiness . i will never stop fighting injustice . " the paper describes @entity1 as " feisty " in his first interview since being released from prison in june after a three - month detention on tax evasion charges that some observers alleged were trumped up . a condition of his bail forbids him from using @entity32 , the newspaper said , but the artist has been outspoken on the social media platform . on sunday his tweets were innocuous : " @entity38 dumplings , regained 3 kilograms body weight . " another said , " five cloves of garlic . " the tweets linked to pictures , including one of feet on a scale reading 214 pounds , and another one of @entity1 and an unidentified male peering into the camera . the playful tweets ended monday night when he wrote about business colleagues detained with him . " today i met @entity54 . he talked about the detention for the first time . ... this steel - willed man had tears coming down . ... he had a sudden heart attack at the detention center and almost died . " later , he tweeted , " because of the connection with me , they were illegally detained . @entity54 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 innocently suffered immense mental devastation and physical torment . " on tuesday afternoon , he issued a call to action : " if you do n't speak out for @entity73 , and do n't speak out for @entity74 , you are not only a person who does n't stand up for justice and fairness , you do n't have any self - respect . " @entity1 confirmed to @entity0 on wednesday that he wrote the tweets , saying " a bird needs to flutter its wings to see if it can fly . " the activist was detained at the @entity84 airport on april 3 while awaiting a flight to @entity86 . police cordoned off his @entity84 studio , and an assistant told @entity0 that eight employees had been called in for questioning . @entity1 was released june 22 , and @entity84 police told the state - run @entity93 news agency that he had confessed to his crimes . " the decision ( to release @entity1 ) comes also in consideration of the fact that @entity1 has repeatedly said he is willing to pay the taxes he evaded , " @entity93 reported . however , in july , a company that @entity2 authorities say is controlled by dissident artist @entity1 challenged tax evasion allegations . @entity0 's @entity104 contributed to this report	@entity67:Zhang Jinsong	@entity2:Chinese	@entity1:Ai	@entity0:CNN	@entity16:Chinese Communist party	@entity38:Lunch 10	@entity54:Liu Zhenggang	@entity15:The Global Times	@entity32:Twitter	@entity104:Eliott C.

" i just feel like @entity34 's will will be done , " she said . the @entity36 , @entity37 , officer faced a second grand jury proceeding for the fatal shooting of @entity6 , an ex-college football player who was reportedly seeking assistance after a car accident . attorneys for @entity1 had denounced the prosecution 's move to resubmit the case as unlawful and filed a motion to block it , but @entity29 affiliate @entity47 reported the grand jury convened monday morning . a grand jury last week declined to indict @entity1 . prosecutors said afterward the grand jury was composed of less than a full panel and vowed to send the case back . according to a handwritten statement filed with the court , the first grand jury requested that the prosecutor submit a " bill of indictment to a lesser - included or related offense , " but the state attorney general said he would resubmit the voluntary manslaughter charge . @entity64 , another attorney for @entity6 's family , described relatives as " shocked and devastated " by the first grand jury 's ruling and said they were concerned a " miscarriage of justice is imminent . " @entity1 's attorneys , however , filed a motion friday saying that any miscarriage was on the prosecution 's part . @entity37 law states that a grand jury can be made up of 12 to 18 members , the defense attorneys said . thus , the prosecution 's claim that it could go back to the grand jury because fewer than 18 members initially heard @entity1 's case was spurious , the motion said . there was " nothing irregular or improper " about the grand jury that heard last week 's case , the attorneys said in a statement . the motion further alleged that @entity8 's statement to the media -- that " this is not over " -- and his announcement that he would resubmit the case was a " wholly improper and blatant attempt to influence the ( second ) grand jury . " the defense reiterated its claim that the shooting , " while tragic , was justified under the circumstances presented to @entity104 at the time , " according to its statement . " we have seen news clips and interviews stating the community should be ' outraged ' at the return of a @entity112 , " the statement continued . " those outraged have simply not heard all of the facts and hasten to a position . the true outrage of this community should be at the attorney general 's complete disregard of the original findings of our first grand jury . " @entity6 's family disagreed and issued a statement saying , " it appears that this motion was filed solely because @entity1 's attorneys feel their client will be indicted once the full @entity129 properly considers the evidence in this case when it convenes on monday . " attorneys for @entity6 's family on january 13 filed a civil lawsuit connected to his death . it targets the city of @entity36 , @entity137 , @entity36 - @entity137 police chief @entity138 and @entity1 . @entity1 shot an unarmed @entity6 , a 24 - year - old @entity139 football player , after a woman -- home alone with her 1 - year - old child -- called 911 and reported someone was trying to break down her front door . it was 2:35 a.m. , and according to the lawsuit , the woman " does not understand that @entity146 may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour . she quickly closes the door , calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system . " the woman told police @entity6 was " yelling for her to turn her alarm off " but never reported that @entity6 harmed her , made threatening statements , brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property , the lawsuit further alleges . police were dispatched , and @entity6 walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere , according to the lawsuit . @entity1 and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call , but @entity1 did n't speak with the woman , the lawsuit says . he instead tracked down @entity6 , who " never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression , " according to the lawsuit . " @entity177 , in direct violation of written police department regulations , fires 12 high - velocity bullets at @entity146 , striking him 10 times in the chest and arms , " the lawsuit continues . the @entity2 has called the shooting unlawful . " the evidence revealed that mr. @entity6 did advance on @entity104 and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of mr. @entity6 was excessive , " police said in a statement on september 14 , the day of the shooting . " our investigation has shown that officer @entity1 did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter . " @entity1 is free on $ 50,000 bond . his attorneys said in their statement friday , " the citizens of @entity137 by and through its grand jury have spoken . we pray that if this case is reheard by a second @entity129 , the same conclusion will be reached -- that there is no probable cause to sustain an indictment for voluntary manslaughter against @entity104 .

@placeholder : " i take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed asap "	@entity58	out of the political frying pan and into the partisan fire for @entity3 secretary @entity2 . a day after apologizing and taking responsibility for the problem - plagued @entity6 website , @entity2 got subpoenaed on thursday by one of the fiercest @entity9 critics of the administration -- @entity12 chairman rep. @entity11 of @entity13 . @entity11 told @entity14 that the subpoena demands documents and information relating to the @entity19 website that his committee previously requested from @entity2 , adding she " answered some questions but evaded a great many . " " now we really need to insist on those documents , " he said . a spokeswoman for the @entity27 noted last week that @entity11 's committee began requesting a broad range of documents and transcribed interviews during the recent 16 - day government shutdown . " while we are working diligently to satisfy their interest and have repeatedly communicated our intent to cooperate , their timeline was not feasible given the vast scope of their requests , " the spokeswoman , @entity33 , said thursday . " we are disappointed that the committee believes a subpoena was necessary ; however it does not change our intent to continue to cooperate with them to produce documents as expeditiously as we are able to , " she added . meanwhile , some top @entity9 members of the @entity47 sent letters thursday to @entity2 and four contractors involved in the website project requesting documents involving security concerns raised at its hearing a day earlier with the secretary . it 's been almost a month since the website for enrolling in president @entity58 's signature health care reforms went live . but technical problems , despite a series of advance warning signs , have impeded the system and provoked anger and frustration . even after a chorus of apologies out of @entity68 , it may be another month before everything 's running smoothly . the federal agency that oversees the troubled website announced thursday it had brought on experts from tech giants @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 to the team working to fix the problems . according to a blog post by @entity81 , spokeswoman for the @entity82 , dozens of people were reinforcing the " tech surge " by the administration working on the website issues . " they come from leading technology companies such as @entity76 and @entity75 , and include individuals with expertise on site reliability ; stability ; and scalability , " @entity81 's webpost said . she identified one of the new additions as @entity96 , a site reliability engineer on leave from @entity74 . on wednesday , vice president @entity99 became the highest - ranking administration official to apologize for the botched rollout . " we assumed that it was up and ready to run , " he told @entity14 's sister network @entity102 . " but the good news is although it 's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of november it will be , and there 'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online . " that mea culpa came after @entity2 apologized for the " miserably frustrating " problems during a 3 1/2 - hour congressional grilling . she said she made a mistake when she told @entity58 that @entity19 was " ready to go " for its october 1 launch . @entity2 promised a " vast majority " of consumers will have an easier time shopping online for health insurance under @entity6 by the end of november . analysis : @entity2 deals with a difficult day " in these early weeks , access to @entity19 has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity124 , including many who have waited years , in some cases their entire lives , for the security of health insurance , " @entity2 said . she echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website 's errors . to the frustrated users who have had problems , she said : " you deserve better . i apologize . i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems . " 5 things we learned from @entity2 hearing @entity58 tried to log on @entity99 said he did n't even bother logging on to the @entity6 site . " actually , the president tried to get online , and my daughter tried to get online , " he said . " i did not , because it was clear that i was not getting online . " @entity58 himself acknowledged that too many people " have gotten stuck , and i am not happy about it . " " there 's no excuse for it , " the president said . " and i take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed asap . " glass half full ? @entity2 said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its promise to provide affordable health care coverage . thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they wo n't go bankrupt if they get sick , she said . who is @entity2 ? @entity9 have called for @entity2 to be fired for the @entity6 problems , but a @entity169 spokesman said wednesday that @entity58 has " complete confidence " in her . " she took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the ( @entity6 ) website , but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the @entity6 implementation that have gone well , " spokesman @entity171 told reporters . in fact , @entity58 tried to turn the tables on @entity9 opponents of his signature health care reforms , challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law . " anyone defending the remnants of the old , broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we should n't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves , " he said . according to the @entity199 website , 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011 , representing about 5 % of the population . the vast majority of @entity124 have coverage through their employer , @entity82 , @entity204 or other public providers . @entity169 spokesman @entity206 said tuesday that " a significant portion " of the 5 % of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges . early warning signs some of the criticism surrounding the website 's launch has to do with what @entity58 and other officials knew -- and when they knew it . @entity14 has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the @entity6 site was not ready to go live , according to a confidential report . the caution , from the main contractor @entity226 , warned of risks and issues for @entity19 , even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track . administration was warned before site launch @entity2 told the @entity234 the outside contractors who built the website never recommended delaying this month 's launch . but she conceded that " we did not adequately do end - to - end testing . " the contracts with the private companies working on the @entity6 website -- which amount to $ 174 million so far , with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have " built - in penalties " allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work , @entity2 said . but @entity2 said the agency will not pay for incomplete work . security questions @entity9 rep. @entity252 of @entity253 , who chairs the @entity254 , accused @entity2 of putting the private information of @entity124 at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website . " this is a completely unacceptable level of security , " he said . " you know it 's not secure . " @entity2 responded that testing occurs regularly , and she told @entity252 she would get back to him on whether any end - to - end security test of the entire system has ever occurred . @entity252 said he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests . @entity268 warned of high security risk at health care website an internal government memo obtained by @entity14 on wednesday that was written days before the website launched warned of a " high " security risk because of a lack of testing . " due to system readiness issues , the ( security control assessment ) was only partly completed , " said the @entity82 memo . " this constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the @entity283 1 operations . " @entity2 told @entity14 last week that @entity58 did n't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live . a senior administration official said @entity58 now gets a " nightly readout " with the latest @entity6 statistics and an update of the website 's status . more : what else could go wrong with @entity6 ?	@entity27:Health and Human Services Department	@entity81:Bataille	@entity82:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services	@entity253:Michigan	@entity254:House Intelligence Committee	@entity3:Health and Human Services	@entity2:Sebelius	@entity6:Obamacare	@entity199:Kaiser Family Foundation	@entity9:Republicans	@entity75:Oracle	@entity74:Google	@entity76:Red Hat	@entity171:Josh Earnest	@entity33:Joanne Peters	@entity14:CNN	@entity13:California	@entity12:House Oversight Committee	@entity11:Issa	@entity19:HealthCare.gov	@entity102:HLN	@entity268:Memo	@entity99:Biden	@entity96:Michael Dickerson	@entity124:Americans	@entity206:Jay Carney	@entity204:Medicaid	@entity58:Obama	@entity234:House committee	@entity226:CGI Federal	@entity169:House	@entity252:Rogers	@entity283:Marketplace Day	@entity47:House Energy and Commerce Committee	@entity68:Washington
@entity296 uncovered the lost 4th century @entity152 port of @placeholder	@entity153	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- it 's a common sight in the traffic - clogged streets of @entity0 , a city that straddles two continents . workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel . opening of the tunnel has been delayed by at least four years by the discovery . a taxi driver , enraged by perpetually gridlocked traffic , stepping out of his car and yelling " maniac ! " at the man driving the public bus behind him . for decades @entity0 has been growing at a breakneck speed ; its population exceeding -- by some estimates -- 15 million people . too bad traffic often moves at a snail 's pace . most residents are quick to tell visitors the city 's transport system is overwhelmed . " @entity0 is a dynamically changing city , every year increasing in population , " says @entity30 , an engineer working with @entity1 's transportation ministry . " we are in need of radical systems , and this radical system is a mass transit system . " the " radical system " city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the @entity42 , the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two . by the year 2025 , engineers predict more than one million people a day will use the tunnel to travel between @entity0 's @entity50 and @entity51 shores . " we will connect two continents , @entity50 and @entity51 , " said @entity52 , one of the many engineers working on the $ 3 billion @entity54 . he was standing on scaffolding , overlooking a gaping 30 - meter deep hole that will one day be a subway station on the @entity50 side of the @entity42 . a concrete wall is all that holds back a churning river of sea water . watch video of the tunnel being constructed " as you can see , some leakage on the wall face has been observed , " @entity52 explained on a tour of the construction site . " in order to overcome these leakages , we have applied chemical grouting . " legend has it , thousands of years ago @entity76 narrowly escaped death sailing up the @entity42 in search of the mythological @entity79 . today , engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world 's busiest shipping channels , at depths of up to 55 meters , in an active earthquake zone . first they dredged a trench on the bottom of the @entity42 . then , using divers and undersea cameras , they submerged and buried 11 massive pre-fabricated tunnel segments , almost all of them longer than a football field . to enter the unfinished tunnel , visitors must climb down a steep staircase in a construction tower surrounded by water in the middle of the strait . during the descent , the temperature plummets and humidity rises . construction workers toil here in the gloom of this 1.4 kilometer long tube on the bottom of the sea , their welding torches spraying showers of sparks in the darkness . one worker claimed that during the lunch break , when the machinery came to a stop , he could hear the sound of oil tanker and cargo ships ' engines as they motored past in the waters overhead . as a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel , engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea . stocked with food and water and equipped with a heavy water - proof door , the " emergency room " is supposed to protect survivors for up to 10 days , until they can be rescued . but , in their rush to modernize @entity0 's transport system , city planners ran into an unforeseen obstacle : history . in @entity150 , a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for @entity0 's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built , archaeologists discovered the lost @entity152 port of @entity153 . it was originally built at the end of the 4th century ad by emperor @entity157 when @entity0 -- then known as @entity158 -- was the capital of the eastern @entity159 . the port 's harbor silted over centuries ago , and eventually disappeared beneath subsequent layers of civilization . until its rediscovery in 2004 , archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books . " this was a big moment of joy and happiness for us , an unexplainable feeling , " recalls professor @entity169 , the acting director of @entity0 's @entity170 . look at pictures of the excavation » " at around one meter below sea level , we started finding the remains of ropes . as we continued [ digging ] a bit more , the remains of a boat surfaced . " since that discovery , armies of hundreds of laborers and archaeologists have been working in a giant pit , three shifts a day , seven days a week . the scale of the excavation is unusual in modern - day archaeology , says @entity195 , an anthropologist from @entity197 's nautical archaeology program . look at a map of the site " its mind - boggling ... it really looks like an @entity206 - type operation , " says @entity195 , who has worked as a consultant on the excavation of the lost port . the @entity150 dig has uncovered an ancient armada : 34 @entity152 ships ranging from dating between the 7th and 11th centuries @entity156 . in one tent , two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40 - meter long merchant vessel . a third man preserves the wood by keeping it moist , sprinkling the relics with water from a hose . archaeologists have nicknamed this ship " @entity222 , " because it is the largest of the @entity153 wrecks . it is believed the vessel once carried wheat from @entity228 to @entity158 . scattered around the ship are shards of pottery , animal bones , and thousand - year - old clamshells . historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the " skeleton approach " to constructing the vessel 's hull . @entity195 says that marked a revolutionary change which transformed shipbuilding from " mostly an art form to a science . " " the earlier methods of building depended on verbal transference of the method from master shipbuilders to apprentices , " he explained . " the development of the latter method ... allowed for the speedy communication of new shipbuilding ideas that could be transmitted on paper . it is the beginning of engineering . ships could be preconceived and pre-designed . " " i think it is one of the unique projects not only for us but for the world , " said geologist @entity261 . in addition to finding the timbers of thousand - year - old jetties and docks , which still jut up in straight rows at the bottom of the mammoth pit , archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of a pre-historic human settlement . " the first man , about 8,400 years ago , came and started to settle here , " @entity261 said . " there was no @entity42 [ then ] . the @entity42 was a river valley ... the people who settled here walked across the @entity42 . " plans to travel beneath the @entity42 have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the @entity284 . the postponement has added untold millions of dollars have also been added to the cost of the entire project . in the rush to move forward , the residents of @entity0 have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city 's ancient past .	@entity159:Roman Empire	@entity158:Constantinople	@entity153:Theodosius	@entity152:AD Byzantine	@entity150:Yenikapi	@entity157:Theodosius I	@entity156:AD	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Turkey	@entity0:Istanbul	@entity197:Texas A&M University	@entity195:Pulak	@entity52:Ilbay	@entity51:Europe	@entity50:Asian	@entity79:Golden Fleece	@entity54:Marmaray Tunnel Project	@entity296:Operation	@entity76:Jason and the Argonauts	@entity30:Zeynep Buket	@entity170:Archaeology Museum	@entity261:Yilmaz	@entity206:Indiana Jones	@entity303:Discovery	@entity222:The Titanic	@entity228:Egypt	@entity169:Zeynep Kiziltan	@entity42:Bosphorus Strait	@entity284:Theodosious Port

" by law , the military is not able to act covertly the way the @entity6 can , and it must answer to @entity22 . the @entity24 website first reported on the potential shift . the military would operate and fly the drones , an administration official told @entity0 , but targeting would still be done jointly by various agencies . the shift would happen over time . " it wo n't happen overnight , " the @entity2 official said , adding that operations in some countries would transfer to @entity2 military control before other nations . " @entity36 is an example of one of the first programs that could shift , " the official tells @entity0 , while shifting the responsibility for the program that operates in @entity42 " would be much further out .

attorney general @entity10 threatened to prosecute @placeholder for sex ads	@entity4	a @entity1 judge has ordered the state attorney general 's office to stop pursuing criminal charges against @entity4 while a lawsuit related to prostitution ads on the popular classifieds site makes its way through the courts . @entity1 attorney general @entity10 has threatened criminal action against @entity4 . in statements to the media and on his web site , @entity1 attorney general @entity10 has accused @entity4 's operators of not doing enough to eliminate ads soliciting prostitution in accordance with an agreement struck last november with 40 states attorney generals . earlier this month , @entity10 sent a letter to @entity4 ceo @entity22 accusing the site of failing to " install sufficient safeguards " to prevent it from being used " as a vehicle to advertise or solicit prostitution . " @entity10 set a deadline of 5 p.m.may 15 to permanently remove portions of the site " allowing for the solicitation of prostitution and the dissemination and posting of graphic pornographic material " or face criminal prosecution . in response , @entity4 filed a lawsuit on wednesday seeking to prevent @entity10 and his employees from charging the site with crimes related to the ads , claiming that to do so violates @entity4 's @entity42 and @entity43 . the site also alleges that @entity10 's threats of prosecution violate the @entity46 , which states that no " provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider . " on friday , judge @entity54 granted @entity4 's request for a temporary restraining order preventing @entity10 and his employees from " initiating or pursuing and prosecution against craigslist or its officers and employees in relation to content posted by third parties on @entity4 's web site " until the court rules on the merits of the site 's lawsuit . @entity4 's lawsuit cites an interview @entity10 gave to @entity71 on monday , in which he likened the site " to a hotel or motel owner that knows prostitution is going on on their premises and fails to do anything about it especially after having been told . " the lawsuit contends that , because the site relies on posters for content , @entity10 's threats leave @entity4 with no choice other than to shut down its @entity1 section or face criminal prosecution . @entity4 's says that since november , the @entity87 , @entity88 - based company has undertaken significant good faith measures to cut back on prostitution - related ads , accounting for an 80 percent reduction in ads in its erotic services subcategory in @entity95 cities . some of the measures included asking posters for credit card number and telephone verification , implementing keyword filtering , and shuttering the erotic services section altogether , the web site claims . in its place , the site established an adult section , where , in addition to the previous measures employed , the ads are also manually reviewed to ensure compliance with the site 's @entity109 , resulting in just 40 ads in the section as of may 18 , the lawsuit claims . " the defensive legal action @entity4 has taken against the solicitors and my office is good news . it shows that @entity4 is taking the matter seriously for the first time , " @entity10 said in a post on his web site on may 20 , the day the lawsuit was filed . " unfortunately , we had to inform them of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response . we trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised .

@entity15 mentions @placeholder , @entity10 leader in @entity68 , killed last year	@entity67	( @entity0 ) -- the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven @entity4 employees and contractors last month appears in a newly released video , in which he vows revenge for the killing of a @entity10 leader . the video shows @entity11 , whom a former @entity13 intelligence official identified as the suicide bomber . @entity15 's brother told @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity16 that the man in the video , who uses the @entity18 , was his sibling . in the tape , which aired saturday on the @entity23 satellite news channel @entity24 , @entity20 says his message is for the @entity4 and @entity27 intelligence . the december 30 bombing at a @entity13 base in @entity31 , in southeastern @entity28 , killed seven @entity4 operatives and a @entity27 army captain . @entity15 was a @entity27 doctor whom @entity27 authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source , a @entity27 official told @entity0 this week . @entity27 and @entity13 intelligence agencies apparently believed @entity20 had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt @entity41 , @entity43 's no. 2 figure , a former @entity13 intelligence official said . @entity15 says in the video that his faith can not be sold to bidders , an apparent message to @entity27 and @entity13 officials that they had failed to win his allegiance . it puts into question how well the @entity4 and other intelligence agencies can penetrate @entity43 . gen. @entity53 , head of @entity54 , told @entity0 's @entity55 that local officials are better at " human intelligence " than foreign agents . " that 's not to say that you ca n't have some real breakthroughs , " @entity53 said during the interview , to be aired sunday . " it 's not to say you ca n't develop sources , you ca n't put people in there and so forth .

" @entity43 's commander of operations in @entity28 , @entity86 , said this week that the attack avenged @entity67 's death . @entity67 was the leader of @entity90 ( @entity90 ) . it was @entity90 that released the video , according to @entity93 , a think tank that specializes in tracking terrorist groups . at one point , the video shows the date of december 20 , 2009 . that is five days before @entity99 passenger @entity98 allegedly tried to blow up a @entity101 flight to @entity102 , @entity103 . the @entity105 - based group @entity104 has claimed responsibility for the @entity108 plot . it is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate , or whether @entity20 was aware of @entity98 's alleged plans . if @entity20 did know about the plot , it could indicate a greater degree of communication between @entity90 and @entity43 than previously thought . in an analysis of the video , @entity93 said there is a connection between the two groups . but @entity93 also pointed out @entity20 appears in the video next to @entity90 leader @entity120 , and that it was @entity90 that released the video . " the @entity90 and @entity43 have a close relationship , and in all likelihood @entity43 was involved at some level in the operation , " @entity93 said in an analysis of the video .

@placeholder says it destroyed part of @entity5 military convoy that crossed border	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity1 claims its artillery destroyed much of a military convoy that crossed from @entity5 into @entity1 this week -- an incursion that two @entity8 newspapers say they witnessed . if true , @entity1 's account and the @entity8 reports appear to give credence to what @entity0 has long alleged -- that @entity5 has been sending troops and arms into eastern @entity1 , where @entity16 rebels have battled the @entity1 military for months . a diplomatic row was brewing friday over the reports , with the @entity8 's foreign office summoning @entity5 's ambassador in @entity21 to explain the incident . @entity5 's foreign ministry has denied any such incursion , and its foreign minister will meet in @entity27 with his counterparts from @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity30 on sunday , state - run news agency @entity23 reported . the meeting 's agenda was n't immediately released . meanwhile , a separate @entity5 convoy -- more than 200 trucks that @entity35 says contain relief goods for civilians in war - torn eastern @entity1 -- remained parked on the @entity5 side of the border , waiting for @entity1 and other inspectors to decide whether to approve the aid 's entry . that @entity1 so far has blocked the aid reflects @entity0 's concerns -- held even before thursday 's reported military incursion -- that @entity5 might try to smuggle more military supplies . @entity1 : majority of vehicles destroyed those concerns took on a new light when @entity8 media outlets @entity52 and @entity53 reported that armored personnel carriers , along with other vehicles with @entity5 military plates , crossed the border near @entity58 , @entity1 , on thursday night . the @entity52 reported that it witnessed 23 armored personnel carriers , in addition to other vehicles with @entity5 military plates , cross into @entity1 through a gap in a barbed wire fence . " armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into @entity1 , " the @entity52 report reads . this is the first time foreign media recorded such an incursion , though it illustrates what @entity0 has said has been happening for months -- that @entity5 has been sending troops and equipment to help the rebels -- @entity1 military col. @entity76 told reporters . @entity1 president @entity79 told @entity8 prime minister @entity80 that @entity1 forces destroyed " the majority " of the @entity5 vehicles , @entity79 's office said . @entity79 " expressed concern over the situation on the border , particularly over the fact that the inflow of @entity5 arms and military machines in @entity1 through the open part of the border continued , " his office said . @entity76 said he did n't know exactly how many vehicles crossed the border , or how many @entity1 's artillery managed to destroy . purported humanitarian convoy still in @entity5 back in southern @entity5 , across the border from @entity1 's @entity102 , 59 @entity1 border guards and customs officers were inspecting the scores of trucks that @entity35 says contain aid for civilians affected by fighting , the @entity1 military said . despite @entity1 's suspicions , @entity76 said that the aid is needed and that @entity1 would allow the @entity110 to distribute it if @entity1 and the aid group find the material suitable . months of fighting has killed hundreds of people and , aid groups say , left thousands in eastern @entity1 without access to water , electricity and proper medical aid . the @entity110 is trying to establish what exactly is in the trucks , @entity119 , a @entity110 spokesman in @entity0 , said . the @entity110 " will temporarily deploy additional personnel to @entity1 and @entity5 for the purpose of this operation and is already in the process of identifying its staff ready for deployment , " @entity119 said . " a four - member team is already present today in the vicinity of the convoy , and more staff are on their way . " @entity35 says the trucks contain grain , sugar , baby food , medical supplies and sleeping bags . @entity1 , meanwhile , says it is distributing its own aid through the @entity110 . the @entity0 - recognized governor of @entity102 , @entity141 , said this week that she does n't want aid from @entity5 . " they send us tanks and @entity146 ( rocket - launching vehicles ) overnight and offer to send humanitarian aid by day , " she said . battle rages on tens of thousands of @entity1 troops have recently stepped up efforts to retake areas in and around @entity102 , @entity58 and @entity154 , three cities held by rebels for months . @entity58 has been the scene of intense shelling for days as rebels try to hold off @entity1 forces . eleven civilians were killed in a 24 - hour period straddling thursday and friday , the @entity58 mayor 's office said . many districts were without power and water , the mayor 's office said . a @entity2 crew that was in @entity58 earlier noted that the shelling had pushed some residents underground into cellars and half - built basements . five @entity1 troops were killed in the past day , @entity173 said friday , adding that some rebels were retreating , trying to dig in closer to the @entity1 - @entity5 border . the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether @entity1 would seek closer ties with @entity180 or @entity5 -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern @entity1 since mid-april , according to estimates from @entity184 officials . the @entity185 and the @entity186 have applied steadily increasing sanctions against @entity5 officials , banks and other interests since march , when @entity5 annexed the @entity192 @entity1 peninsula of @entity193 . @entity5 's move came a month after @entity1 's parliament ousted @entity197 president @entity196 . @entity196 left office after violent protests against his government in the capital , @entity0 . those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the @entity186 in favor of closer ties with @entity5 . aid or invasion ? question looms as @entity5 convoy nears @entity1 opinion : why @entity212 is n't going to make peace journalist @entity214 reported from @entity0 , @entity2 's @entity215 reported and wrote from @entity216 , and @entity2 's @entity217 reported and wrote from @entity218 . @entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .	@entity23:RIA-Novosti	@entity21:London	@entity27:Berlin	@entity16:pro-Russian	@entity193:Crimea	@entity29:Germany	@entity219:Radina Gigova	@entity80:David Cameron	@entity58:Donetsk	@entity110:Red Cross	@entity119:Loersch	@entity154:Horlivka	@entity214:Victoria Butenko	@entity2:CNN	@entity216:Atlanta	@entity0:Kiev	@entity212:Vladimir Putin	@entity197:pro-Moscow	@entity196:Yanukovych	@entity8:British	@entity218:Hong Kong	@entity192:Black Sea	@entity53:The Telegraph	@entity52:Guardian	@entity173:Lysekno	@entity79:Poroshenko	@entity76:Lysenko	@entity30:France	@entity35:Moscow	@entity215:Jason Hanna	@entity1:Ukrainian	@entity102:Luhansk	@entity217:Jethro Mullen	@entity141:Irina Verigina	@entity221:Will Ripley	@entity220:Diana Magnay	@entity146:Grads	@entity222:Lindsay Isaac	@entity5:Russian	@entity180:Europe	@entity184:U.N.	@entity185:United States	@entity186:European Union
@placeholder : can @entity47 's " nice guy " humor compete with tv 's reality show nastiness ?	@entity153	( @entity0 ) -- a lot of us were rooting for @entity3 on monday night . given the contentious recent history of the host chair -- @entity6 to @entity7 to @entity6 -- he was standing on a media trapdoor , with critics just waiting to pull the lever . early reviews say he not only survived one of the highest - pressure debuts ever -- he killed it . if nothing else , a big debut buys you time . but does victimless humor -- the kind that does not slice , dice and julienne its subjects -- have legs in a culture that likes its entertainment with a serrated edge ? it 's a question that applies across demographics -- from the prized millennials , who have grown up on the discord of reality television ; to the baby boomers , who are decades into acerbic late night as we know it -- and will have to adjust to bits like slow rolling the news . it 's a tough neighborhood , with @entity3 a little like @entity41 walking the streets of a war zone . or , as @entity44 jokingly ( but not inaccurately ) said on monday night : " welcome to 11:30 , bitch . " one of @entity47 's established competitors , @entity48 , in a recent monologue said that @entity50 met her @entity52 © e when her car broke down and @entity50 " pulls up behind her in her tow truck . " ( pause for nervous laughter at the lesbian joke . ) @entity50 , predictably , was not amused , firing back to @entity58 : " i do n't remember making fun of you when you had sex with all your interns . " @entity3 's humor can be topical , but almost always with a softer touch : @entity65 saying she does n't know if she 'll run for president is like him saying " i still do n't know if i 'll have a beer on @entity68 . " somehow , i do n't think there will be any fights with @entity50 . and in a broader context , it 's a tough entertainment media in general . look no further than reality television , populated by macho slimeballs , back - biting boyfriend stealers and assorted high achievers in the low art of interpersonal nastiness . there is a whole new genre allowing us to make fun of rural @entity84 . no , @entity85 , we 're not laughing with you . there is even research that the mean - spirited swamp that is reality tv is starting to seep into the culture in general . researchers at @entity92 showed 250 women three scenes : one violent , one frightening and one showing gossip -- including a woman who ostracized a friend . all got a response , but the highest mental arousal was category three , which the researchers termed " relational aggression . " in other words , watching people be mean to each other may " prime the brain " to be mean ourselves . @entity3 's ( we 're all friends just joking around ) humor might be up against something even bigger -- right in his demographic sweet spot . a @entity111 of @entity113 study looked at 72 studies of empathy among college students over 30 years . they found that empathy -- the ability to identify with others and relate to their feelings -- has dropped an incredible 40 % since 2000 . among the reasons : the technology - driven isolation , a generational sense of entitlement and social media 's ability to call attention to ourselves . also responsible is the winning - is - everything sports culture and huge paydays for those who climb to the top of their fields . all told , if there were a sequel today to dr. @entity139 ' classic " i 'm ok , you 're ok " , it might be : " i 'm ok , you 're pathetic .

@entity8 disappeared during a business trip to @placeholder in 2007	@entity6	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- evidence is growing that a retired @entity5 agent who disappeared in @entity6 four years ago is alive and being held in @entity7 , secretary of state @entity2 said thursday . @entity8 disappeared during a business trip in march 2007 . " we have received recent indications that @entity14 is being held somewhere in southwest @entity7 , " @entity10 said in a statement . " as the government of @entity6 has previously offered its assistance in this matter , we respectfully request the @entity6 government to undertake humanitarian efforts to safely return and reunite @entity14 with his family . " @entity21 checked into a @entity23 hotel and attended meetings on march 8 , 2007 . he checked out the following day , but did not make a scheduled flight to @entity27 . in recent months , the @entity28 received " proof of life , " according to a senior diplomatic official and a @entity28 government official . both requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation . the government official told @entity1 the evidence was received within the last six months and is " clear and convincing proof that @entity8 is alive . " the government official would not elaborate on what the " convincing " evidence entailed . its emergence has fueled a fresh round of " discussions " between the @entity28 and @entity6 , according to the senior diplomatic official . the discussions , not equivalent to negotiations , were described as " working level , " meaning it was not conducted by senior administration officials , the official said . the @entity28 is awaiting action by @entity6 and is hopeful progress is being made , the official said . @entity8 's wife , @entity55 , said her seven children , two grandchildren and she " await the day we will be reunited . " " our family is tremendously encouraged by the news @entity14 is alive but remains concerned for his safety and well being , " she said in a statement thursday . @entity8 suffers from diabetes and requires regular medication , she said . @entity21 's family told @entity1 in 2010 he was working as a private investigator in @entity27 and may have been looking into a cigarette smuggling case . @entity21 family members have met with local @entity6 officials and have traveled there to retrace his steps . @entity21 flew to the @entity71 in 2008 to ask questions about her husband . @entity6 president @entity74 declined to meet her . the family has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return . the @entity79 and @entity5 have consistently denied @entity21 was working for the government and have demanded @entity6 free @entity21 -- if it is holding him . @entity6 has insisted it does not know his whereabouts . the @entity28 has lacked reliable information about whether @entity21 was alive or dead . in the first few years after his disappearnace , @entity86 administration officials had said they suspect @entity6 authorities seized @entity21 and were holding him in a jail inside the country . but as the years since his appearance passed , many officials believed he might be dead . @entity21 is a retired @entity5 agent from @entity97 , @entity98 . after leaving the agency , his wife says , he worked as a security consultant specializing in cigarette smuggling . the @entity79 has repeatedly met with @entity21 's family and have sent diplomatics note to @entity106 through the @entity108 government , who represents the @entity28 interests in @entity6 in the absence of an @entity28 diplomatic presence in the country . @entity1 had reported that @entity21 met with @entity114 , an @entity28 fugitive who lives in @entity6 , shortly before his disappearance . @entity114 -- known in @entity6 as @entity114 -- converted to @entity116 and was given refugee status in @entity6 after admitting in interviews to killing @entity119 , a former @entity6 diplomat under the shah , in @entity121 in 1980 , he told @entity1 in a 2007 interview . @entity114 was detained by @entity6 officials in plain clothes and taken away from the room he shared with @entity21 to be interrogated about his @entity6 passport , he said in the interview . when he was freed the next day , he said , he was told by officials that @entity21 had returned to @entity27 . senior administration officials have told @entity1 that they believe @entity114 met with @entity21 , but do not believe him to be a credible source of information on @entity21 's whereabouts . in 2009 , secretary of state @entity2 personally passed a note to @entity6 officials at a @entity71 conference on @entity135 in the @entity136 asking them for help in finding @entity21 . @entity5 spokeswoman @entity138 said thursday the agency could not comment further . " we are working very hard to bring @entity8 home safely , " @entity138 said . " his family misses him dearly and we remain concerned about his heath , given history of diabetes . " sen. @entity146 of @entity98 has sought information for the @entity21 family for the past four years . " it 's encouraging that we may have good news , " @entity146 said in a statement later thursday . " i 'm praying that he can be reunited with his family .

@entity172 , @entity173 : @entity10 can remind @placeholder to seize the moment and stand on the right side of history	@entity11	( @entity0 ) -- in contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between president @entity3 and outgoing @entity5 president @entity4 at @entity3 's ranch in @entity7 , @entity8 , this week 's talks between @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12 mark the first time in history that a @entity16 president will host a series of informal meetings with a new @entity5 leader . while issues such as @entity21 , cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions , what really matters is whether @entity11 and @entity10 can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences . as charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures , what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters ? both @entity11 and @entity10 are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office . both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them . for @entity10 , dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in @entity46 is hard enough . a series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse , resulting in what some have referred to as his " second term blues . " for @entity11 , an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform - minded political honeymoon to an untimely end . luckily , each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues . in his first few months as president , @entity11 has worked to give the @entity5 government a face - lift , trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something they aspire to : the @entity72 , or what @entity11 has described as the rejuvenation of the @entity5 nation and the opportunity to realize a middle - class lifestyle . as @entity11 pursues these aspirations , he should join @entity10 in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor , persistent post-graduate unemployment , housing bubbles , food safety concerns , immigration ( or internal migration for @entity5 ) reform , health care reform and tax reform . if @entity11 is to be successful in confronting these issues , it will be difficult to do so without political reform . in @entity5 , dissent has been growing on college campuses , where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues : universal values , freedom of the press , civil society , civil rights , past party mistakes , crony capitalism and judicial independence . whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes . as a former professor of constitutional law , @entity10 is uniquely situated to address the importance of @entity5 political reform and constitutionalism . @entity10 needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues does n't make them go awayâ € ” it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas , and @entity5 has seen how that has turned out in the past . as the first black president , @entity10 can also candidly and respectfully articulate @entity16 's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy , human rights , media freedom and the rule of law , which the @entity16 believe to be fundamental to the long - term stability and prosperity of any country . some might argue that discussion of @entity5 's much needed political reform would set @entity10 and @entity11 on course for a contentious relationship . in fact , it would help remind @entity11 that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform - minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office . instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing , @entity10 and @entity11 have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper , more candid and more cooperative @entity5 - @entity16 relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the @entity5 and @entity16 people . only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation . and only when such unity of purpose is realized will @entity5 and @entity16 be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 and @entity173 .	@entity3:Bush	@entity16:America	@entity173:McElveen	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Crawford	@entity5:Chinese	@entity11:Xi	@entity4:Jiang Zemin	@entity21:North Korea	@entity8:Texas	@entity10:Obama	@entity46:Washington	@entity172:Li	@entity12:California	@entity72:Chinese Dream
world champions @entity8 beat @entity11 10 - 0 in their @placeholder game in @entity56	@entity25	( @entity0 ) -- if ever there was a @entity3 versus @entity5 clash in international football this was it . @entity8 , the reigning world and @entity10 champions taking on @entity11 , ranked 138th by the game 's governing body @entity12 , one place below @entity15 . almost all of @entity11 's squad are amateur players -- nine are unemployed -- and their coach @entity19 even admitted before the tournament began : " we are not here to win . " after a heavy defeat in their opening @entity25 game against @entity26 , @entity19 declared their dream had come true -- solely because they found the net in a 6 - 1 reverse . there was to be no goal this time round as they were put to the sword by @entity8 who completed a 10 - 0 victory to all - but secure a semifinal berth . that represented the biggest in the history of the competition that pits the champions of each @entity12 confederation against each other and acts as a precursor to next year 's @entity45 in @entity46 . but @entity11 's squad were afforded a standing ovation from the 71,000 crowd , who backed them throughout the match . before the game there was a heavy police presence outside the ground in @entity56 in response to the ongoing protests in @entity46 . " @entity11 set an example in terms of fair play and went forward whenever they had the opportunity , " @entity8 coach @entity59 said . " we did n't score more goals because they did n't let us . this game has n't damaged football in any way . in some ways it 's made it even stronger . " after handing over pendants to their opponents prior to kickoff , @entity11 maintained parity for less than five minutes as @entity76 striker @entity75 beat goalkeeper @entity77 at his near post to put the " @entity8 " ahead . any @entity11 foray into @entity8 's half was roared by the crowd but @entity59 's side soon fired two goals in the space of two minutes as @entity85 and @entity75 found the net . @entity87 grabbed a goal either side of the break before @entity75 sealed his hat - trick just before the hour mark -- making him the first player to do it twice in the tournament following his three against @entity96 in 2009 . @entity98 's treble followed soon after , and @entity99 then got number eight . @entity75 missed the chance to claim his fourth , sending a penalty over the crossbar after @entity105 was adjudged to have handled the ball . but he made amends a minute later as he rounded @entity77 to slot into an empty net . @entity85 then got his second , firing home from inside the area . the crowd were willing @entity11 forward but the closest they came to scoring was when @entity114 narrowly failed to latch onto @entity116 's pass , but the offside flag had gone up . upon the final whistle , @entity11 gave @entity8 a guard of honor as the world champions left the pitch before the minnows took the applause of the crowd . however , the battle for semifinal places will go to the last round of @entity128 matches , following @entity130 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity130 in thursday 's late match . veteran striker @entity132 celebrated his landmark 100th international appearance -- becoming the first @entity134 to do so -- by scoring the winner six minutes after halftime . the 34 - year - old finished off a fine move involving strike partners @entity139 and @entity141 , ending his run of 12 games without a goal for the @entity146 champions . it was his 34th goal for his country , putting him ahead of @entity141 in the all - time list . captain @entity150 gave @entity130 the lead in the 19th minute but @entity76 midfielder @entity152 equalized eight minutes before the break . if @entity130 beat @entity11 on sunday , then @entity26 's @entity26 would have to inflict @entity8 's first defeat of the tournament in order to qualify .	@entity26:Nigeria	@entity99:Juan Mata	@entity25:Confederations Cup	@entity116:Marama Vahirua	@entity114:Lorenzo Tehau	@entity139:Edison Cavani	@entity85:Silva	@entity87:David Villa	@entity134:Uruguayan	@entity150:Diego Lugano	@entity130:Uruguay	@entity132:Diego Forlan	@entity3:David	@entity0:CNN	@entity5:Goliath	@entity8:Spain	@entity56:Rio	@entity75:Fernando Torres	@entity59:Del Bosque	@entity76:Chelsea	@entity15:Syria	@entity12:FIFA	@entity11:Minnows Tahiti	@entity10:European	@entity152:John Obi Mikel	@entity19:Etaeta	@entity105:Ricky Aitamai	@entity128:Group B	@entity98:Villa	@entity96:New Zealand	@entity77:Roche	@entity163:Spanish	@entity146:South American	@entity141:Suarez	@entity45:World Cup	@entity46:Brazil

@placeholder will go to the polls on may 26 and 27 to elect a new president	@entity0	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- since the 2011 revolution , @entity0 have seen near non-stop protests , the toppling of two presidents , six elections , and a seemingly endless political crisis . but what they have n't witnessed yet is what has been demanded all along -- a better economy . as the country goes to the polls next week to elect a new president , both candidates insist this is something they can be trusted to deliver . former army chief @entity17 pledges new roads , housing , airports , jobs and an end to the energy crisis . @entity25 's lone opponent , left leaning politician @entity26 , has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories , create new jobs , build new housing and improve health care . these are lofty promises . but has either candidate offered specifics on how they will get things done ? " not yet , " said @entity1 based economist , @entity36 . " we 've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes @entity25 . " @entity36 believes that in order to deliver on campaign promises , @entity0 's next president must attract investors from both inside and outside @entity0 through large scale economic reform . " it 's not going to be easy , " he added . " the problems are surmountable but i have to say the structural problems of @entity0 's economy are enormous . " these problems include rising food prices , unemployment at roughly 14 % and a crippling budget deficit of around 12 % of gdp . on top of all that , passions are still running high over the ousting and trial of former president @entity62 who was removed from his post by the army in 2013 . a critical step to recovery , many business - minded economists say , is cutting costly food and fuel subsidies that eat up roughly one third of @entity0 's budget . but for the country 's poor , cutting subsidies will be an extremely tough pill to swallow . to ease the impact , @entity36 says @entity0 's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick - started by billions of aid received from @entity84 . " if the right policies are in place , @entity0 will respond quickly , " @entity36 said . " but changing sentiment is the key by putting right policies and right people in place to show something is changing . " only then , he concludes , can @entity0 's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of @entity0 still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country . see also : @entity1 's nightlife comes back to life see also : the @entity101 's king of hotels see also : gas fields could unite @entity104	@entity17:Abdel Fattah el Sisi	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Cairo	@entity0:Egyptians	@entity26:Hamdeen Sabahi	@entity25:Sisi	@entity104:Cyprus	@entity36:Blair	@entity101:Middle East	@entity84:Gulf Arab states	@entity109:Adel Fattah el Sisi	@entity62:Mohamed Morsy
@entity263 : @entity51 ' protest over @placeholder is a sign sports figures are finding their voices	@entity55	( @entity0 ) -- keep your head down and your mouth shut . play the game . smile for the camera . collect your fat paycheck . and go home . that has been the mantra for far too many professional athletes for as long as i can recall over my 20 years of working in sports media . most sports stars have chosen to stand for nothing , believing instead that donning a uniform on game day and dazzling the world with their superior athletic skills somehow fulfills their contribution as @entity21 citizens . that somehow their physical gifts excuse them from being an active player in the game we call life . truth be told , we journalists have been willing co-conspirators -- all too happy to stick to safe @entity32 questions about the game and avoid the uncomfortable issues . in fact , there was a time not too long ago when any question to a pro athlete that carried a whiff of controversy would mean " interview over . " but that was yesterday . today -- finally -- a few bold athletes are changing the game , finding their voices and speaking out about injustices they see -- whether fans like it , or not ; whether their coaches like it , or not . on sunday , five @entity51 players raised high their hands in a " do n't shoot " stance to show their solidarity with the @entity55 , @entity56 , protesters after the grand jury decision not to indict the police officer who shot an unarmed 18 - year - old , @entity59 . some police , pundits and fans have objected , but the players are n't apologizing . they are following in a proud tradition of agitators from the distant past who demanded the world see them not only as sports icons but as proud men and women who would use their talent to fight for equality in @entity21 . men such as @entity76 , a conscientious objector to the @entity78 and forceful voice for black equality in his own nation , and tennis great @entity82 , who marched along with civil rights leaders in the ' 60s and became a leading voice in the global fight against apartheid in @entity89 . olympians @entity90 and @entity91 lifted their black power salute during the medal ceremony of the 1968 @entity94 to protest racism in the @entity21 . that day , @entity91 wore a necklace of black beads on the @entity99 podium to represent the thousands of african - americans who were lynched at the hands of white racists in @entity21 . @entity90 carried a box containing an olive branch to call for peace . those athletes refused to sit on the sidelines and ignore racial injustice in their lifetimes . the goal was to inspire a nation , not just to win games . phenomenal women such as @entity115 and @entity116 vocally advocated across generations for gender and racial equality . those women never let sports fans forget that they stood for something far greater than the game . could it be that now a new generation of athletes has at last found a renewed sense of purpose and recognized their power beyond the sports ? it 's about time . i 'm proud of each one of these young men and women who are finding the courage to speak up and speak out -- to join their rightful place in the @entity21 conversation . the world is often an ugly place , but this slow rebirth of activism by professional athletes is a beautiful thing to witness : â € ¢ @entity143 spoke volumes last year with his powerful # wearetrayvonmartin photo tweet featuring himself , @entity146 and other @entity148 players protesting with hoodies pulled tight over their famous faces in the wake of the shooting of @entity153 , an unarmed @entity154 - @entity21 teen who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity156 , @entity157 . â € ¢ @entity159 player and @entity161 analyst @entity160 , among others , spoke out on - air against child abuse in the wake of the @entity167 @entity166 child abuse story . @entity160 described his own experiences as a child . â € ¢ and last fall , professional athletes around the nation joined the call to end domestic violence with the " @entity175 " campaign . one of those players , @entity177 , the 29 - year - old cornerback for the @entity178 , lost his mother when he was 8 after she was shot by his stepfather . today , @entity177 is one of the league 's most ardent voices denouncing against men who commit violent crimes against women . and he 's targeting his peers . " it 's telling men that this not ok . we 're not going to sit back and say , ' we 'll let you guys handle it . ' that 's not the case anymore . people die from this , and we need to do something about it , and if we see something , we need to say something , " @entity177 told @entity196 . these are the images that are beginning to compete for time with sports highlights on @entity21 's screens . they may make us feel uncomfortable . they may make it impossible for some of us to escape the problems at our own doorsteps . but this is @entity21 , where since 1791 , the @entity214 has given citizens the right to freedom of speech and the right of the people to assemble peaceably , and to petition the government , among other things . league rules do not trump this constitutional right ; to try to silence players would , or course , not stand up in court . the league can and often does , however , dictate how players can appear in public when at work ( games , practice , press conferences ) , but only when the players are at league - sanctioned events , or in uniform . the league , like other companies , can not demand that its employees not speak out as private citizens on their personal time . and though in the past @entity243 commissioner @entity242 has tried to stop players from speaking out about sports - related controversies , you 'll notice that the @entity51 players will not be sanctioned in any way for their @entity55 protest . the @entity250 and other sports have also declined to fine or sanction players who have recently protested in some form for @entity153 . indeed , today anyone would be hard - pressed to justify why pro athletes -- tax - paying @entity21 citizens -- should be denied the right to speak out about any issue in the world . yes , it 's a new day in sports . and the revolution is being televised .	@entity21:American	@entity250:NBA	@entity116:Billie Jean King	@entity82:Arthur Ashe	@entity153:Trayvon Martin	@entity89:South Africa	@entity275:Jones	@entity157:Florida	@entity156:Sanford	@entity154:African	@entity214:First Amendment	@entity0:CNN	@entity175:No More	@entity177:Gay	@entity178:Pittsburgh Steelers	@entity91:Carlos	@entity51:Rams	@entity56:Missouri	@entity55:Ferguson	@entity59:Michael Brown	@entity76:Muhammad Ali	@entity78:Vietnam War	@entity32:X-and-O	@entity146:Duane Wade	@entity243:NFL	@entity242:Roger Goodell	@entity99:Olympic	@entity94:Summer Games	@entity263:Roxanne Jones	@entity90:Smith	@entity160:Carter	@entity161:ESPN	@entity166:Adrian Peterson	@entity167:Minnesota Viking	@entity143:LeBron James	@entity148:Miami Heat	@entity115:Althea Gibson	@entity159:Hall of Fame	@entity196:USA Today Sports
@entity153 president calls support of @placeholder from some celebs " deplorable "	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- while several high - profile actors and directors have rallied around @entity5 , not everyone in @entity2 believes he should be freed and forgiven . the case surrounding the arrest of director @entity5 has both supporters and critics . in the face of a petition signed by notables such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 calling for the immediate release of @entity5 following his detainment in @entity19 , a backlash is building against such support . " i ca n't believe that @entity2 has separated itself so completely from @entity26 morality , " said @entity21 , a former child actor and president of a @entity23 , which advocates on behalf of young performers . " it is yet another case of @entity2 being out of sync with most of @entity26 . " @entity5 pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , but fled the @entity26 before he could be sentenced . in the years since , the director known for " @entity33 " and " @entity34 " settled in @entity35 and avoided authorities until he was arrested saturday while on his way to the @entity38 . in the aftermath of @entity5 's arrest last weekend , a number of performers -- including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- appear as supporters on a petition which states , " @entity5 is a @entity35 citizen , a renown and international artist now facing extradition . this extradition , if it takes place , will be heavy in consequences and will take away his freedom . " @entity5 's detention has stirred debate over whether he should be returned to the @entity26 to face possible imprisonment . supporters make note of his age , the years that have passed , his talent and the victim 's own assertion that pursuing the case opens fresh wounds for her as reasons the director should be left alone . but critics observe that @entity5 's supporters might be downplaying his crime . " i do n't think a lot of people take the sexual assault of children very seriously at all , and it 's something we battle everyday , " said @entity73 , executive director of @entity74 , a national organization to protect children . " we say at @entity74 that we are the most bipartisan group in @entity26 because we 've got everyone from @entity2 liberals like @entity83 [ @entity84 ] from ' @entity85 ' to extremely conservative people . ... but i will say with the notable exception of a few people from @entity2 , we get blank stares from some of that crowd . " weeks pointed to the example of a discussion on @entity96 's " @entity95 , " in which panelist and actress @entity97 made the comment that she did n't believe the original charges against @entity5 were for " rape - rape , " as what he views as a pervasive attitude .

@placeholder say team got new plane because it was supposed to take off first	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 said tuesday that it did n't bump 50 passengers just to accommodate the travel plans of a nationally ranked college basketball team on sunday , one of the busiest travel days of the year . a spokesman for the carrier said the plane the 15th - ranked @entity10 were supposed to use had an engine problem , so the carrier put them on another jet out of @entity15 while workers tried to fix the issue . when the problem could n't be solved , @entity1 booked many of the 50 passengers headed to @entity21 on a later flight . a handful of passengers left on flights monday , @entity23 said . the story made national sports websites monday with headlines like " @entity1 bumps entire flight to accommodate the @entity32 basketball team , " but @entity23 said the fact that it was a charter flight played no role in the plane swap . flight schedules weigh heavily on operational decisions , he said . the @entity38 were due to take off at 3 p.m. , and the commercial flight was scheduled to depart about a half - hour later . @entity40 , the regional carrier that operated both flights , assured @entity1 that it would have the problem solved in time , @entity23 said .

corruption in @entity1 very common , according to @placeholder	@entity128	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- six months after more than 1,000 people lost their lives in the deadliest garment factory accident in @entity1 history , the @entity4 country continues to mourn the deaths of workers in other avoidable incidents . earlier this month , at least seven people were killed and dozens injured in a large fire that broke out at a knitwear factory on the outskirts of the capital , @entity0 . while the cause is not immediately known , the owner of the company said in a press briefing that the fire had originated in the chimney of a heating machine . he suggested the way the fire quickly spread through factory was mysterious . as always with these incidents , a committee of government officials and representatives from the garment manufacturers ' association convenes to investigate . but ultimately it 's never guaranteed that these findings will be made public and corrective measures taken . aging safety equipment the knitwear factory , which supplies leading brands across the world , was recently cited for unsatisfactory safety standards , according to local news reports . though firefighters told reporters the factory was properly equipped to deal with such an incident , @entity43 , president of the @entity44 , which advocates better treatment for factory employees , said she found out of date firefighting equipment when she visited the site in the wake of the october fire . opinion : the bloodshed behind our cheap clothes after the @entity61 accident earlier this year , which left 1,129 people dead and more than 2,500 injured when the entire building collapsed , safety standards at garment factories across @entity1 came under the spotlight amid concerns they had been lax or ignored . the incident was an eye - opener for many . it led to many changes in the garment sector in the months that followed . the country 's labor laws were amended with provisions requiring employers to introduce adequate safety measures for workers , while an agreement was signed by the government and representatives of @entity1 employers ' and workers ' organizations to ensure a more integrated approach to improving safety . substandard global brands supplied by @entity1 factories were also moved to take action to ensure suppliers complied with suitable safety standards . but in june this year , @entity95 president @entity94 said @entity1 had not been taking steps to " offer internationally - recognized rights to workers in the country , " while announcing the suspension of the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) for @entity1 . this agreement gave @entity1 duty - free access to @entity95 markets for some items , though garment products were not included . one of the biggest issues is compliance , in part due to the shortage of inspectors in @entity1 able to cover the vast number of factories spread throughout the country . while steps are being taken to recruit more inspectors , it 's impossible to overlook the failures of the government 's accountability mechanisms . this has created a culture of impunity among factory owners . the failure of successive governments in @entity1 , ranked in the bottom tier of the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) of global anti-corruption watchdog @entity128 , to curb wrongdoing in the garment industry has created an environment where disasters will happen . a sector that started to grow quickly in the 1980s , the garment industry has never been accountable to the country 's labor laws and regulations . this is because owners are mostly from powerful sections of society who seemingly did n't bother to follow rules . according to one @entity1 media report , 10 % of lawmakers in the national parliament are owners of garment businesses in @entity1 . according to @entity43 , the number is actually even higher . rules ignored the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) is considered to be one of the most influential trade bodies in the country , with links to all of the major political parties . but such is the dependence of @entity1 's economy on this industry as its largest export earner , demands to improve working standards and wages are often ignored . some labor leaders have alleged that during any crisis in the industry , the body takes the side of owners . in the case of the @entity170 fire in november 2012 , the role the @entity150 played in protecting the owner raised many eyebrows . the body was criticized for failing to provide a report into the fire , which claimed the lives of more than 100 people . despite gradual amendments to labor laws , workers ' rights are still far from guaranteed . @entity184 , while welcoming efforts to improve the legal framework , expressed concern that international standards for workplace safety are not being met . @entity184 also said the government " has consciously limited basic workers ' rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation . " crucially , the provision to punish factory owners in cases of accidents was not properly mentioned in the amended law . though the law mentioned that " adequate " measures have to be taken to ensure air circulation , light , drinkable water and sanitation , the term " adequate " is not properly defined , leaving it to the discretion of owners . many factory owners still arbitrarily sack their employees as they do not give contracts to them , thus making it impossible for the workers to demand compensation at the labor court . @entity43 says most workers in the garment sector are women , so their rights and entitlements are grossly ignored . female workers are also frequently subjected to sexual harassment and often lose their jobs so that they can not claim maternity benefits . owners fight back factory owners also have their say in this whole saga . many i have spoken to said that with such a competitive market worldwide , they simply ca n't give in to the demands of workers . they say persistent corruption and political chaos in @entity1 has driven up the cost of doing business there . " the buyers , despite our repeated failures to ensure compliance , come to @entity1 as they can get the cheapest rate here compared to neighboring countries , " one owner , who asked not to be identified , said . " they will keep on coming as long as we offer this rate and we ca n't afford to lose it by increasing salaries of the workers or ensuring compliance , " he added . " this whole industry has grown ... to make profit for both the owners and foreign buyers , " added @entity43 . " they ca n't think of the workers as their working partners . the mentality of the colonial era still exists . " with only a few initiatives by the government and no real evidence of the political will to improve safety standards at work , disasters will continue to happen . measures will keep being promised without effective action . the workers , who keep the economy running , will continue to bare the brunt of injustice and deprivation . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity271 .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Bangladesh	@entity0:Dhaka	@entity61:Rana Plaza	@entity4:South Asian	@entity94:Barack Obama	@entity184:HRW	@entity44:Garment Workers ' Unity Forum	@entity101:GSP	@entity170:Tazreen	@entity128:Transparency International	@entity43:Mishu	@entity127:CPI	@entity95:U.S.	@entity150:BGMEA	@entity271:Hussein
" we were getting direct responses because of @entity20 and @placeholder , " @entity9 says	@entity22	( @entity0 ) -- last weekend , the ensemble relationship comedy " @entity1 " opened to an astonishing $ 33.6 million , exceeding practically everyone 's expectations , including those of one of the film 's standout stars , actor - comedian @entity9 . " i knew the movie was going to do well because it was tracking well , " he tells @entity0 , " but we were thinking in the range of $ 20 - 25 [ million ] . when in came in the 30s , that was a little mind - blowing . for me that just shows the power of social media . " no kidding . @entity9 has practically built his entire career harnessing the power of his @entity20 feed and @entity22 page to drive audiences to his films . last september , his stand - up comedy feature " @entity25 " opened to $ 2 million on just 97 screens , a feat he largely credited to his social media fan base spreading word and supporting the film . for " @entity1 , " @entity9 notes that , combined , the entire cast boasts well over 20 million @entity20 followers . " so we got together and just did a blitz ourselves ... . when you 're doing movie promos and there 's billboards and stuff , yeah it 's out there , and you know people see it . but we were getting direct responses because of @entity20 and @entity22 . it was unbelievable . " of course , a movie 's number one debut is not built on tweets alone . @entity9 credits three other diy efforts for helping catapult his film to the top of the box office : multitasking ! as part of his stand - up comedy tour , @entity9 started screening the trailer for " @entity1 " at the beginning and ending of every set . " because i was doing arenas , i was [ performing ] for 15 - to - 20,000 people a night . i was reaching anywhere from 60 - to - 90,000 people through the course of a week . " making a scene ! earlier this year , @entity9 created a media kerfuffle when he got himself ejected from the @entity68 all - star celebrity game -- and then was still named mvp . " yeah , first celebrity to ever get ejected from a celebrity game , " says @entity9 with a hearty chuckle . he swears his outburst was n't premeditated -- " i literally was having a good time and being myself " -- but he 's not ashamed at taking advantage of the situation either . " all press is good press , " he says . " all the attention it got , it became ' @entity9 from " @entity1 " ... ' -- not just ' @entity9 . ' and the story just got bigger . " giving away free popcorn ! " i love to pop up at the movie theaters , " says @entity9 . " i love to treat the people who are there .

' literally just showing your fans your appreciation . i would n't be where i am now if it was n't for their support . so i 'm not the type of person who can turn my back on that support . i try to do little things to show that i 'm not only appreciative of it , but i do n't take it for granted . i 'm humbled by it . it 's amazing to me . " chances are very likely , meanwhile , that @entity9 will have another film of his hit number one at the box office this weekend : the romantic comedy " the five - year engagement . " he 's already planning his social media blasting for the week ; he calls his @entity20 and @entity22 sites " my permanent radio station " for their promotional power . but they also provide him an invaluable way to connect with his fans . " i make sure that my fans realize that they can talk to me , " he says . " i 'm here . i 'm reachable . i think sometimes celebrities get so big they 're not reachable . when you 're not in a place where people feel like they know you or can contact you or can talk to you , it 's harder for them to support you . people want to act like they know celebrities . they want to see pictures . they want to know where you 're going . they want to hear you talk about your family . they want to hear you b * * * * and complain about problems . they want to know that you 're human . people [ in the entertainment industry ] who do n't realize that are people who will be left behind . they 're not realizing the day and time we 're living in . they really are n't .

she says @placeholder tells women to " grab life by the lapels , " but culture presents hurdles	@entity9	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- one of the world 's most famous poets and writers , an inspiration to countless women , recently celebrated her birthday . at her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity9 celebrated turning 82 . born in an era unfriendly to women whose ambitions would take them out of the home or away from a narrow range of " acceptable " jobs , she nonetheless succeeded in many fields . she has led an admirably peripatetic life ; she has been an author , dancer , actor , civil rights activist , radio host . hailed , above all , for her vivid written portrayals of adolescent life in the @entity28 and the horrors of her violent childhood , she 's become a role model of resilience for generations of @entity35 women . when she speaks , it is with intense clarity , as if her words are aligned , standing at attention . untethered from convention and politesse by age , hard - won experience and inner strength , she expresses truths that many women may suspect but are loath to admit . " i love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels , " she once said . " life 's a bitch . you 've got to go out and kick a- - . " but 41 years after the she grabbed those lapels with her groundbreaking novel " @entity58 , " i found myself reflecting at her party on what has -- and has not -- changed for women heading out into the world . the truth is , it 's still very hard to get to the point of accomplishment of a @entity9 . modern women still struggle to succeed without being labeled the witch , ditz or office pariah . indeed , young women i meet when i speak with college students across the country are aware of this as they prepare to plunge into their adult lives . i find that regardless of the career opportunities that are at their fingertips , advances that their foremothers would scarcely have believed , some women ( especially women of color ) still brace themselves for limitations and obstacles . is there a magic key to a life lived free of gender and racial biases , they ask ? there is not . there are barriers . but how long must young women leaving high schools and universities expect to be swimming against generations - long waves ? we have come a long way , but still we see reflected in the media daily the crude stereotypes that confront and trivialize accomplished and prominent women . it might be a first lady mocked for revealing a little cleavage , another first lady questioned for leaving her job to take care of her children or a candidate for vice president criticized for her commitment to family . and though women represent more than half the voting age population and are a significant political force , at this " post-feminist " moment , only six of the nation 's 50 governors and only 17 of the 100 @entity35 senators are women . at the same time , the @entity123 's 2009 @entity122 showed that more women than men over the age of 25 have bachelor 's , graduate and professional degrees . and a recent @entity130 , entitled " @entity131 , " cited statistics from a @entity134 survey that shows that women 's median income rose 32.9 percent from 1990 to 2006 , while men 's only rose 6.3 percent . should we be surprised how young women respond to these mixed messages ? i talked with @entity9 about such issues when she welcomed me as a guest on her program and later invited me to her home to discuss themes about womanhood that i would eventually explore in a book . we talked about how the limitations placed on us as young girls began with our families . i still bristle , and told her so , about how my family had advised me to learn to type and become a secretary . she counseled that they had done that out of love , that their intention was not " to break you . " rather , the intent was " to keep you from breaking your heart . " but as we all know , the world can be much crueler than our families : the route to success for women , politically , economically and personally , is often lined with broken hearts and humbling moments that i would hope do more to ignite our determination than quell it . maybe we can argue that our defeats kindle resilience ? i wonder if @entity9 's living legacy reaches today into the lives of modern women whose intelligence , determination -- and resilience -- helped them surmount obstacles on the way to lofty positions in the world . yes , there are mixed messages everywhere for young women , but then there are the achievements of a @entity185 , a @entity186 , a @entity187 . @entity188 , determined women willing to push aside the obstacles that a sometimes retrograde culture throws in their way can take inspiration from those women 's successes . and as @entity9 once said , " history , despite its wrenching pain , can not be unlived , but if faced with courage , need not be lived again .

@placeholder : @entity17 rate fixing unforgivable because it affects public , not rich investors	@entity22	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 ceo @entity1 and coo @entity3 have resigned in the wake of the interest rate - fixing scandal that has rocked the bank . the resignations come less than a week after @entity2 , one of the world 's largest banks , was fined $ 450 million by @entity13 and @entity14 regulators after admitting it purposely under - reported its interest rates as part of @entity17 ( @entity19 interbank offered rate ) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in @entity19 each trading morning . @entity0 interviewed analyst @entity22 , a former investment banker with more than 20 years experience in the financial services sector , about @entity1 's resignation and what it means for the future of banking culture . what does @entity1 's resignation mean ? @entity1 's resignation sets a precedent -- we have to realize that @entity2 was the first of 15 banks that are under investigation for @entity17 manipulation . let 's say that even half of those banks come to the same conclusion and are fined by the regulators . does this mean we 're going to lose seven or eight of the most powerful bank ceos in the world ? if that 's the case then this signals a complete and radical cultural change within the financial services industry , and the whole industry will change because of this . and that 's why @entity2 were so important to get this right . this was an unforgivable situation for one simple reason : this affects the public . when banks beat up on each other , who cares ? when banks beat up on professional investors -- high net worth individuals , people who should know better -- who cares ? but when you start messing with grandmothers ' pensions , everyone cares , and that 's why this is a game - changer . explain how this scandal has affected the public ? the libor rates for different currencies are directly connected to 99 % of all ( commercial ) banking products -- mortgages , credit cards , and payouts for things like pensions are all based on @entity17 rates . so if banks are manipulating @entity17 rates , what they 're basically doing is taking money out of the public 's pocket , because their mortgage rates change , because their interest rates change , their loans / credit cards change -- or their pension income changes . various @entity17 rates are determined each day for different currencies ( dollar , yen , euro ) around the world , and these rates are the benchmark by which commercial banking operations around the world are conducted each day in those respective currencies . what side of the bank was most interested in @entity17 ? this would be the investment bank , because they make money on libor day in and day out . as head of the @entity2 investment wing when @entity17 was being manipulated , is n't it hard to believe @entity1 did n't know it was going on ? actually it is believable , because it 's about 15 people globally who handle @entity17 -- 15 people who pick up the phone and talk to their colleagues and say : " let 's make @entity17 this today , " so he would n't know about these conversations , so we do n't blame him or think what he did was criminal -- what we think was that he should 've had more oversight at the bank . how will this actually be a culture change ? wo n't it be a slap on the wrist ? the new management coming in is going to have to say " we have to look at every part of the bank that affects the public , and we have to have so many checks and balances that absolutely nothing can happen . " up to this point , if you 're a banker and you screw the public , whatever -- the assumption was that the net benefit to the economy of your bank was greater than one or two individuals ( in the public ) . what we 're saying now is " no , if you screw one person , you 're out of here -- you screw another bank , a professional investor , go ahead -- but if you screw a grandmother ( out of money ) , you 're out . " the next @entity2 boss will be from the same banking culture as @entity1 . what will be different ? the change is very simple -- now they know they can get fired for those things . before they thought they were untouchable . the problem with culture is the degrees of separation -- these guys know the price of a bottle of @entity172 , but you ask them the price of a pint of milk and they have absolutely no clue . the new management will come on and say , " i have to know the price of a pint of milk , i have to know what people pay on a mortgage , and i have to make sure that whatever i do at this bank is n't going to affect that . " and that 's a great change . it 's something we need . what qualities will a bank boss in this " new culture " need ? the next boss needs to be a general . before a boss would only worry about money -- as long as at the end of the year the bottom line says you were profitable -- that 's not enough anymore . you have to profitable , but you have to be moral as well . more morality in banking is exactly what we 're talking about -- the culture has to be moral , what happened here is n't about money , it 's a morality issue . where has this push for " moral " banking come from ? banks are no longer on a pedestal . all of a sudden banks and grocery stores are at the same level -- we would n't accept a supermarket selling us spoiled bananas . historically , whatever the banks said we would do , but now we wo n't accept that anymore . people are saying , ' hold on , you 're a business like any other business , you make money off our backs , so do what i tell you to do . ' i remember the days when banks opened at 10:00 a.m. and closed at 3:00 p.m. with an hour for lunch . so you had to change your entire life to deal with the banks . those days are over . the change is that the public understands what banks are doing and all of a sudden we say there are alternatives -- i can put my money into @entity240 , @entity240 has a bank . other supermarkets have banks . i can get a credit card at @entity246 . so all of a sudden the banks are realizing they need to start doing the right thing . how big is the libor scandal going to get ? this is a potential scandal for the 15 biggest banks in the world , because they 're the only ones who play with @entity17 rates -- these are huge organizations , which also poses some risk . these are enormous organizations employing millions of people . the biggest problem with the @entity1 thing is people may believe that all bankers are evil . fifteen guys cause @entity17 rates , and if the police have their say they 're going to be in prison . but a million other people working for a bank get up and do an honest day 's work for an honest living , they send their kids to school , they 're honest people . we should n't paint everyone with the same brush . how many people determine @entity17 ? is the system going to change because of this scandal ? it usually ends up being one person at each bank who determines @entity17 for the day . a bank determines what they want @entity17 to be for the day , and the @entity17 person calls up his equivalent and the other banks and they negotiate what the rate will be for that day . that number then pops up on every computer around that bank , and that 's the rate . the system absolutely has to change -- we 've been talking about changing the system for some time , but we just believe that in a period of such change because of the economic crisis , we should wait until everything settles down and then change it . if the @entity304 - style bankruptcies that wrecked the global economy did n't bring real change , why will this scandal ? the difference is that all of @entity304 ' customers were all filthy rich . their customers were governments , municipalities , professionals in the financial services industries -- they knew what they were doing , there were risks that they all understood . but ( @entity2 ) is retail banking : this is human - being - to - human - being , people who are n't expected to know anything about financial services , they 're expected to be able to trust the banks . that 's what makes this different . in fact , we give these banks a license on the agreement that they never put ordinary customers at risk , and that 's what they did here . so @entity1 resigning is the start of a new era of commercial banking ? it is , and the banks do n't like to move fast , but the governments are going to insist on a culture change . let 's see how things go with the other banks ( that may be implicated in libor rate - manipulation ) -- if i were any of the other banks , i 'd want to stay real quiet now . i 'd want to keep this thing in the courts for 10 years until everybody forgets about it . any early favorites for the next @entity2 ceo ? would you want that job ? that 's the problem -- i think anyone who probably should fit into that job is smart enough not to want it . why would you do that ? if you want to be in a bank right now , you want to be number two . you get just as much money as the top guy , but you 're not in the press all the time -- so the next time a head has to roll , it 's someone else 's head . but this culture change wo n't transform the investment bank - related issues that brought down the global financial system in 2008 , will it ? that 's fair , but we 've been working on a solution to that problem for a few years now . so we 're well under way to fixing that problem . if you look at the difference ( since 2008 ) , the banks are far better capitalized now , and they have all been moving in the right -- or " protect the banks " -- direction . what banks have not been doing is moving in the " protect the customer " direction , and this is going to be make them move that way now . @entity394 contributed to this report .	@entity3:Jerry del Missier	@entity2:Barclays	@entity1:Bob Diamond	@entity0:CNN	@entity13:British	@entity304:Lehman Brothers	@entity17:LIBOR	@entity22:Silva	@entity246:Starbucks	@entity172:Dom Perignon	@entity19:London	@entity240:Tesco	@entity14:U.S.	@entity394:CNN Wires

" the @entity26 together with @entity27 have forwarded an urgent order to the @entity5 embassy in @entity1 to make all necessary efforts to clarify the situation and to offer maximum consulate protection to the distinguished musician , " according to an online cultural ministry statement cited by @entity20 . a @entity5 diplomat in @entity1 said the pianist denied the charges , @entity19 said .

legislation would give president @placeholder more time to pursue diplomacy	@entity19	( @entity0 ) -- bipartisan legislation was introduced in the @entity2 on thursday that would authorize new economic sanctions on @entity4 if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions . the proposal led by @entity12 chairman @entity11 , a @entity14 @entity13 , and @entity15 , an @entity17 @entity16 , emerged despite @entity19 administration appeals for @entity20 to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing . the @entity23 said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and president @entity19 would veto the legislation if @entity20 were to approve it now . a letter sent to senate majority leader @entity28 from nine @entity30 committee chairs said international talks over @entity4 's nuclear program should continue without additional sanctions being imposed by @entity20 . " we believe that new sanctions would play into the hands of those in @entity4 who are most eager to see the negotiations fail , " the letter states . but proponents of the plan that sprouted from bipartisan talks involving several lawmakers said the threat of stepped - up action could be a powerful lever against @entity4 's nuclear interests and work toward more fruitful diplomacy . " current sanctions brought @entity4 to the negotiating table and a credible threat of future sanctions will require @entity4 to cooperate and act in good faith at the negotiating table , " @entity11 said in a statement announcing the legislative effort . rep. @entity55 , a @entity56 @entity16 , told @entity0 's @entity57 that he would support the sanctions . " the fact is that if @entity4 is serious about the agreement , they should have no problem with the sanctions because these sanctions only kick in if they do n't comply with the agreement , " he said . " secondly , the president should want these sanctions as a weapon to hold over the @entity4 , so i do n't see why the president is so opposed to these sanctions .

@entity1 's @placeholder - dominated central government remains wary of such partnerships	@entity100	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- until recently , @entity0 was among the most dangerous places in @entity1 . @entity5 col. @entity4 meets with @entity7 leaders in @entity0 , formerly a hot spot for insurgent activity . located in the so - called " triangle of death , " a violent area south of @entity12 , it was the site of frequent clashes between coalition forces and @entity7 fighters . in may , two @entity5 soldiers went missing in @entity0 and were never found , despite a massive search . but today , @entity7 tribal leaders in this town cooperate with @entity5 forces in their battle against foreign fighters and @entity26 in @entity1 . " it 's all the roll of the dice . it 's people and politics all intertwined down here , " said col. @entity4 , commander of the @entity30 , 10th @entity31 . @entity4 now greets his former enemies with kisses , hears their grievances , spends time in their homes and even shares meals with them . he is surprised at how far relations have progressed . " our hope a year ago was to establish very basic inroads down here , " @entity4 said . " we thought the insurgency was far too deep for us to be able to effectively root it out and develop the relationship with the locals . " as happened in @entity53 province to the west , local @entity7 leaders from this town south of @entity12 finally turned on the @entity26 extremists in their midst when the death and destruction became too much to bear . " killing people , stealing goats , everything , you name it , " said sheik @entity59 , when asked why he and his men now oppose @entity26 . @entity59 has recruited some 150 volunteers to man checkpoints and carry guns . @entity7 sheik lists grievances against @entity26 » the @entity5 military calls the men concerned local citizens . " i have n't had more than one @entity74 destroy a vehicle in an area where concerned citizens were located ... in the past two months , " @entity4 said . to further encourage local tribesmen to turn against @entity26 , the @entity5 military pays local sheiks to provide security in their area ; they receive up to $ 10 per man . it 's a controversial policy , but one that has helped the @entity5 military identify and stop insurgents , @entity4 said . " in the three months since this has started , we have gathered more insurgents up , more terrorists , than we did in the preceding nine months . and that 's because they have pointed out to us these people within their own ranks , " @entity4 said . the next step is to have these young @entity7 join the @entity1 police . for that to happen , the @entity5 military needs the cooperation of the @entity100 - dominated government in @entity12 . cooperation , however , is slow in coming . @entity1 's central government is concerned these gunmen might turn into armed militias if the @entity5 pulls out and civil war erupts . to assuage these concerns , @entity4 is registering as many of the local volunteers as possible , taking photographs and retinal scans , hoping leaders in @entity12 will agree to hire them as @entity1 police . " what we see as being the end state down here is these tribes being brought back full into the government process , " @entity4 said . the @entity30 has lost 53 men in @entity1 . their photos are proudly displayed in the brigade 's headquarters . some of the @entity5 soldiers here have a hard time forgiving the @entity7 for what they might have done in the insurgency . " were some of these people part of the insurgency ? sure they were , " @entity4 said . " our job over here is n't to do what 's comfortable for us , and it is n't to do what we want , " he said . " our job is to do the nation 's bidding . if this gets our nation closer to a solution for this country ... then that 's what we 're gon na do .

@placeholder 's 10 p.m. show to go off the air next month when @entity129 start	@entity4	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity5 host @entity4 is going back to late nights after a low - rated experiment in prime time , the network announced sunday . @entity4 's prime - time talk show , which debuted in september , " did n't meet affiliates ' needs , " said @entity9 , chairman of @entity10 . the program will go off the air february 12 , when the @entity17 begin . the network is now negotiating with @entity4 and its current late - night hosts , @entity20 and @entity21 , to decide who ends up with which time slot , @entity9 said . @entity20 took over @entity5 's flagship " @entity26 " when @entity4 moved to the 10 p.m. slot in september . @entity27 took over @entity20 's former show , " @entity29 . " @entity9 said the plan now is for @entity4 to host a new , half - hour show at 11:35 p.m. et , followed by " tonight " with @entity20 at 12:05 a.m. @entity27 's show would move to the 1 a.m. hour , he said . do you think @entity5 did the right thing ? the goal is to keep all three hosts , but nothing was a done deal as of sunday , he said . reports of the shakeup first emerged last week . @entity4 dismissed them on his show on thursday night , telling his audience , " it 's always been my experience @entity5 only cancels you when you 're in first place . " @entity4 's move to prime time was a risk for @entity5 , because it put a talk show up against scripted prime - time shows and ran it five days a week . network spokeswoman @entity53 said last week that @entity4 performed " exactly as we anticipated on the network . " but for @entity5 's affiliates , @entity4 's low ratings were taking viewers -- and the resulting ad dollars -- away from their late local newscasts . " the 11 o'clock news hours were bleeding ratings , " said @entity61 , an analyst for the entertainment trade paper variety . while @entity5 appeared to be fine with @entity4 's numbers , the affiliates " kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings , " @entity61 said . @entity69 , the chairman of @entity5 's affiliate board , called the decision announced sunday " a great move for the affiliates , the network and , most importantly , the viewers . " " we admire their willingness to innovate , and their willingness to change course when it did n't work for us , " @entity69 said in a written statement . for @entity5 , which had promised to give @entity4 a full year in the 10 p.m. time slot , " it 's certainly a little bit of egg on the face , " @entity61 said . @entity86 analyst @entity85 called the network 's gamble on @entity4 " the biggest fiasco in the history of television . " " what they did n't realize was that the people who watched @entity4 in late night were not necessarily the same people who watched in prime time , so there was no reason to believe that his audience would follow him to prime time , " @entity92 said . meanwhile , the @entity20 - helmed " tonight " lost about half its audience " and actually really hurt late night , which is a big profit center for @entity5 , " @entity92 said . moving " tonight " -- which has held its current slot for decades -- back a half - hour is likely to hurt the show , and @entity92 predicted that @entity5 will be unable to keep all three hosts . " my guess is down the road , they will give back @entity4 the ' @entity26 , ' leave it on at 11:35 p.m. , and @entity116 will move to @entity117 , " he said .

" i ca n't imagine how hard this experience must be for you , and i want you to know that our family and our love and our support goes out to you as well , " @entity1 said , as he remembered his oldest girl , @entity7 . @entity7 died friday at the hands of a gunman who opened fire at her elementary school in @entity18 , @entity19 , in the second deadliest school shooting in @entity22 history . the attack killed 20 children , between the ages of 6 and 7 , and six faculty members at @entity27 , before the suspect apparently committed suicide . earlier , the man allegedly killed his mother , bringing to 27 the number of lives he took . fighting back tears with his voice cracking , @entity1 asked saturday night that the tragedy " not turn into something that defines us , but something that inspires us to be better , to be more compassionate and more humble people . " remembering the victims @entity1 's comments came amid a public mourning in this southern @entity45 town of 27,000 , where residents have been trying to make sense of the shooting . many of the victims ' parents asked for privacy as they grieve . but @entity1 , 30 , stepped forward to talk about @entity7 . he moved his family from @entity54 to @entity19 eight months ago after accepting a job as a physician 's assistant in the newborn unit at @entity59 . that 's where he was when he got word of the shooting -- in a telephone call from his wife . @entity1 , though , was unable to leave the hospital , which went into lockdown as a precaution over the school shooting . " it went from ... ' i ca n't imagine this is happening . this has to be some sort of a mistake , ' " @entity1 said . " i did n't think it was that big of a deal at first . i thought with the first reports that were coming in it did n't sound like it was going to be as tragic as it was . " when the lockdown was lifted , @entity1 raced to a firehouse near the school where parents were gathering to wait for news of their children . how you can help there , a photographer captured a photo of an agonized @entity1 and his sobbing wife , @entity90 , as they left the firehouse , presumably after discovering their daughter was among the casualties . on saturday , @entity1 vacillated between present and past tense as he talked about his daughter , struggling to come to terms with @entity7 's killing . " my daugher @entity7 would be one of the first ones to be standing up and giving her love and support to all of those victims , because that is the type of person she is , " he said . she was " an exceptional artist and she always carried around her markers and pencils so she never missed an opportunity to draw a picture or make a card for someone . " he recounted how his daughter slipped one of her cards in the casket at the funeral of her grandfather , who died in october in an accident . she was the oldest of three girls , and helped one sister learn to read and helped the youngest to do crafts . " she was their best friend , " he said . @entity7 's " laughter was infectious , " he said . " this world is a better place because she has been in it . " the outpouring of grief from people around the world has overwhelmed the family . thousands who never met the girl are mourning her on @entity134 after friends of the @entity1 family established the @entity138 page . what started out as an effort to help the family raise money to take @entity7 's body back to @entity54 for burial has become an online spot for thousands to mourn . share your tributes on the @entity134 page , the 6 - year - old smiles back with a wide smile and twinkling blue eyes . " dear @entity1 family , thank you for the love and forgiveness you have shown . our hearts were all broken yesterday as we learned of this tragedy , " wrote one person . many posting on the page offered prayers of support and condolences to the family . @entity1 told reporters on saturday that he and his wife were still trying to come to terms with the enormity of the loss .

they say fresh violence erupts in @placeholder and @entity18 after @entity4 observers leave	@entity19	( @entity0 ) -- a small group of observers resumed the @entity4 ' mission to monitor a truce in @entity6 that was tenuous from the start and showed signs wednesday of unraveling as opposition activists again reported widespread violence . in what appeared to be a pattern of retaliation , security forces were accused of attacking a number of hot spots , including the cities of @entity18 and @entity19 , after @entity4 monitors had left the areas . security forces have also reportedly targeted residents who have spoken to the monitors , according to @entity24 , spokesman for special envoy @entity25 . @entity24 told the @entity26 that people have been harassed and even killed for speaking with the monitors . one activist in @entity19 urged the monitors to return to the besieged city to see what was unfolding in the wake of their departure . " the security forces have continued their siege on @entity19 for the second day today , " said @entity36 , identified only by his first name for safety reasons . " we desperately call on the international monitors to return to @entity19 to see the other face of the regime , " he said . in remarks to the @entity26 on tuesday , @entity25 criticized reports of actions forces loyal to president @entity48 . " i am particularly alarmed by reports that government troops entered @entity18 ( monday ) after observers departed , firing automatic weapons and killing a significant number of people , " @entity25 said . " if confirmed , this is totally unacceptable and reprehensible . " @entity56 erupted again nationwide wednesday . at least 100 people were killed , including 70 in @entity18 , 16 of whom were children , said the opposition @entity61 . the reported violence in the southern city of @entity18 occurred two days after a visit to the city by @entity4 observers . an activist in @entity18 told @entity0 that at least 56 people were killed in the shelling of the city 's @entity71 neighborhood on wednesday . the activist said that the @entity6 military began shelling the neighborhood at noon ( 5 a.m. et ) , causing a number of houses to collapse , killing those inside . the @entity61 said residents were still pulling bodies from the rubble late in the evening . @entity0 can not independently verify reports of violence and deaths within @entity6 , as the government has restricted access by international media . a handful of @entity4 observers have in recent days toured restive cities and towns after @entity25 , the joint @entity4 - @entity91 envoy , brokered a six - point peace plan with @entity48 . @entity25 said @entity6 's foreign minister told him that heavy weapons and troops had been withdrawn from population centers and that military operations had ended , key elements of the peace plan . @entity25 described the communication as " encouraging , " but added , " the only promises that count are the promises that are kept . " @entity102 sen. @entity101 , @entity103 , told @entity0 that he had little hope for success for the @entity4 mission in @entity6 . " how atrocious is it that the government allows these monitors in , people have the courage to come out and express their grievances and then they slaughter people , " he said . " if it was n't so serious , it would be a bad joke . " the ongoing carnage , say opposition activists , is proof that @entity48 does not intend to keep his promises . at least 38 people were killed across the country tuesday , the @entity61 said . the @entity122 said @entity123 , a @entity124 volunteer , was killed and three others were injured in @entity19 on tuesday evening . @entity127 was shot and killed in a vehicle clearly marked with the @entity124 emblem , the agency said . the @entity26 recently authorized sending up to 300 monitors to @entity6 for 90 days . they are tasked with observing a cease - fire that was supposed to have begun april 12 . by next monday , 30 observers are expected to be on the ground , with that number swelling to 100 by month 's end . but as of wednesday , only 13 were in @entity6 . one problem is that @entity138 is unwilling to allow monitors from any of the 60 - plus nations that are part of the " @entity142 , " a group that aims to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which includes the @entity102 , @entity147 and @entity148 , met this month and recognized the opposition @entity149 as a legitimate representative of the @entity6 people . analysis : @entity4 mission does nothing to change endgame in @entity6 nationalities aside , some question whether the observers will be able to get an objective , comprehensive view of the situation . " they are all the time watched by the security forces of the regime , " said one opposition activist , who is not being identified for safety reasons . the observers are also tasked with implementing the peace plan , which calls for the government and the opposition to end the bloodshed , provide access to the population for humanitarian groups , release detainees and start a political dialogue . the crisis began in march 2011 , when the government started cracking down on peaceful protesters calling for the ouster of @entity48 , whose family has ruled @entity6 for 42 years . the @entity4 estimates at least 9,000 people have since died , while activist groups put the death toll at more than 11,000 . @entity0 's @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .	@entity26:U.N.

@placeholder already planning to send 6,000 more troops to @entity8 this year	@entity6	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- there are no immediate plans to commit more @entity6 troops to the ongoing war in @entity8 , president @entity2 said wednesday . @entity10 prime minister @entity9 , left , and president @entity2 meet in @entity0 on wednesday . speaking to reporters alongside @entity10 prime minister @entity9 , @entity2 said he would consult with @entity6 allies before determining a strategy in @entity8 after last month 's elections there . " i 'm going to take a very deliberate process in making those decisions , " @entity2 said . " there is no immediate decision pending on resources , because one of the things that i 'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a determination about resources . " the @entity6 has about 62,000 @entity6 troops in the country , and @entity30 allies -- including @entity10 -- have another 35,000 . the @entity31 is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year . there have been indications that @entity2 soon could be asked to commit even more @entity37 troops . defense secretary @entity38 , however , has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000 - troop increase before considering whether to send more . support in the @entity6 for the war in @entity8 has dipped to an all - time low . just 39 percent of @entity6 favor the war , while 58 percent oppose it , according to a national @entity45 survey released tuesday . recent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in @entity10 . @entity2 thanked @entity9 for his country 's commitment to @entity8 , where more than 2,800 @entity10 troops and dozens of civilians are stationed . " they have fought ; they have had staying power ; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for , " he said . watch @entity2 and @entity9 meet » most of the @entity10 forces are based in the southern @entity66 province , home to some of the worst violence and instability . at least 130 @entity10 troops have been killed in the war . last year , after a national debate , the @entity10 government extended the mission -- which was to end this february -- until the end of 2011 . @entity9 said wednesday that " @entity10 is not leaving @entity8 " but is " transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011 . " the two leaders also discussed economic issues , issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that " open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in @entity88 and globally . " @entity2 acknowledged that the " @entity37 " clause in the economic stimulus package has been a " source of irritation " between @entity10 and the @entity6 and is something @entity9 has repeatedly brought to his attention . the clause is a provision in the $ 787 billion stimulus package enacted in february that states only @entity37 goods can be used in stimulus projects . but it stipulates that the measure would not override existing @entity6 trade treaties such as the @entity102 . @entity9 said @entity10 's concerns about the clause are " important irritants ... but relatively small " when compared with the overall @entity6 - @entity10 trade relationship .	@entity31:Pentagon	@entity2:Obama	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity6:U.S.	@entity37:American	@entity10:Canada	@entity38:Robert Gates	@entity9:Harper	@entity8:Afghanistan	@entity30:NATO	@entity45:CNN / Opinion Research Corp.	@entity102:North American Free Trade Agreement	@entity114:PM of Canada	@entity88:North America	@entity66:Kandahar

hornet stings have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 in @placeholder since july	@entity2	hornets have killed dozens of people in @entity2 and injured more than 1,500 with their powerful venomous sting . the @entity4 , known scientifically as @entity4 , carries a venom that destroys red blood cells , which can result in kidney failure and death , said @entity9 , an entomologist at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 . but perhaps a bigger problem than the toxicity of the venom is allergy , @entity9 says . some people are naturally more allergic to stinging insects than others ; a sting can trigger a deadly anaphylactic reaction , which may involve airway closure or cardiac arrest . since july , hornet attacks have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 people in three cities in @entity29 province , according to the local government . among those attacked , 206 are receiving treatment in hospitals . what are these hornets ? in person , the @entity4 , which is the largest hornet species in the world , looks like " the wasp analog of a pit bull " with " a face that looks like you just ca n't reason with it , " said @entity44 , professor of entomology at @entity46 in @entity47 . these hornets are found throughout @entity49 and @entity50 , in countries such as in @entity2 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 . and they 're big . the giant hornet extends about 3.5 to 3.9 centimeters in length ( 1.4 to 1.5 inches ) , roughly the size of a human thumb , and it has black tooth used for burrowing , according to an animal database at the @entity63 . the queens are even bigger , with bodies that can grow longer than 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) . the species feed their young the larvae of other insects and use their mandibles to sever the limbs and heads of their prey . the giant hornets are attracted to human sweat , alcohol and sweet flavors and smells . they are especially sensitive to when animals or people run , according to @entity82 . every breeding season , the giant hornets produce an average of 1,000 to 2,000 offspring , @entity9 said . they feast on other insects such as wasps and bees , launching coordinated attacks on the hives of their prey . most hornet hives or nests are tucked away in secluded places , such as tree hollows or even underground . " it 's very difficult to prevent the attacks , because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites , " said @entity96 , director general of the @entity97 in @entity53 . @entity103 giant hornets and other terrifying creatures what is the human impact ? over the summer and early fall , hornets have invaded schools full of children and descended upon unsuspecting farm workers in @entity2 . one of them is @entity113 , who was attacked in @entity115 while looking after her millet crop . " the hornets were horrifying , " she told @entity82 , the @entity2 state - run news agency . " they hit right at my head and covered my legs . all of a sudden , i was stung , and i could n't move . " even now , my legs are covered with sting holes . " two months , 13 dialysis treatments and 200 stitches later , @entity124 still remains hospitalized and unable to move her legs . @entity96 , who specializes in entomology , warned that the sting from an asian giant hornet was severe compared with those of other insects . the influx of venom to the human body can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure , leading to death . patients like @entity124 have been receiving dialysis to remove the toxins from their bodies . in photos , patients bore deep , dark craters scattered across their limbs , the size of bullet wounds . dr. @entity148 , director of the intensive care unit at @entity150 of @entity151 and an expert of the provincial hornet sting treatment guidance unit , warned in a @entity29 government release that hornets tend to be aggressive and more active during september and october , their breeding season . the hornets do not go into hibernation until december , according to local government authorities . local authorities have deployed thousands of police officers and locals to destroy the hives . about 710 hives have been removed and at least 7 million yuan ( about $ 1.1 million @entity165 ) sent to areas affected by hornets , according to a government press release . why so many attacks now ? the spate of attacks could be caused by the unusually dry weather in the area , authorities say . the arid environment makes it easier for hornets to breed . urbanization could also be a contributing factor , as humans move into hornets ' habitats . some experts cited in @entity82 stated additional factors such as increased vegetation and a decrease in the hornets ' enemies , such as spiders and birds , because of ecological changes . in other words , it 's a good season for the hornet population , which makes it a bad season for people who encounter them . the provincial government of @entity29 has warned residents to wear long sleeves when outdoors and not to attempt to drive the swarms away or remove the hives . @entity53 is familiar with asian giant hornet stings , too . about 30 to 50 deaths are reported each year in @entity53 from such attacks , according to @entity53 studies . most of the deaths are due to allergies to the venom , @entity96 said . the giant hornets are also destructive to western honeybees . research in @entity53 suggests that tens of thousands of honeybee hives are damaged by the giant hornets each year . how to protect yourself people run into trouble when these hornets form a nest : a basketball - shaped nest that looks like it 's made of gray paper , sometimes under an eave , @entity9 said . if you disturb one of these , or happen to whack a tree that has a nest in it , the hornets may respond as if they 're under attack . humans can get themselves in danger by reacting poorly to these large hornets . if you see a nest or a hive , just avoid it , @entity9 says . if one of them buzzes around you , do n't panic . " do n't flap or scream or freak out , " he advised . " just calmly walk away . " one victim told local media this month that " the more you run , the more they want to chase you . " some victims described being chased about 200 meters ( 656 feet ) by a swarm . an area of research that has n't been explored is how many people get stung by these hornets while taking down a nest in order to use the larvae as fish bait , or even to eat . the larvae do not have venom , @entity9 explained . but in general , people should not tamper with these nests . as powerful as their sting can be , it is highly unlikely that these hornets would travel all the way to the @entity165 to find a new home , @entity9 said , or in the @entity258 for that matter . to go to @entity261 , they 'd have to cross some " nasty deserts " to which they are not adapted . as deadly as live adult giant hornets can be , some people do n't shy away from them altogether . there is a sports drink in @entity53 called @entity268 that incorporates amino acids derived from hornets . in @entity271 , where the giant hornet is known as the " tiger head , " the insect is sometimes used in alcoholic drinks , @entity44 said , the idea being that " the essence of this great big strong hornet will go out into the booze , and when you drink it , you 'll become strong . " that 's one way to get a buzz .	@entity29:Shaanxi	@entity82:Xinhua	@entity113:Mu Conghui	@entity258:United Kingdom	@entity151:Xi'an Jiaotong University	@entity150:First Affiliated Hospital	@entity271:Taiwan	@entity2:China	@entity4:Asian giant hornet	@entity9:Schmidt	@entity53:Japan	@entity52:Korea	@entity50:Southeast Asia	@entity55:Nepal	@entity54:India	@entity12:Arizona	@entity11:Tucson	@entity10:Southwest Biological Institute	@entity103:Asian	@entity268:VAAM	@entity97:Hokkaido Research Center for Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute	@entity96:Makino	@entity124:Mu	@entity261:Western Europe	@entity165:United States	@entity148:Wang Xue	@entity115:Ankang City	@entity63:University of Michigan	@entity44:Starr	@entity46:University of West Indes	@entity47:Trinidad & Tobago	@entity49:East
@entity8 has been praised , criticized for showing his @placeholder faith	@entity35	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 will open the door to the media at 10:15 tuesday morning . that line likely will be a lot longer than usual . with multiple media reports saying @entity8 is set to sign with the team , there will be many reporters angling for their first look at the polarizing backup quarterback in a new jersey . @entity14 , @entity15 and other media outfits cited league sources in saying the 25 - year - old former @entity19 winner had come to terms with the @entity1 on monday . @entity15 reported @entity8 is expected to join the @entity1 for a mandatory three - day training camp in @entity22 , @entity23 . the @entity1 declined to comment on the rumor , saying head coach @entity25 would have a 10:45 a.m. news conference . " i am sure it will be addressed then , " team spokesman @entity27 wrote in an e-mail . in three @entity14 seasons , @entity8 , who was waived by the @entity30 in april , has played 35 games and completed 48 % of his passes . he has been praised and panned for being outspoken about his @entity35 faith , including taking a prayerful position at games that has led to a internet photo craze known as " @entity39 . " critics have said he does n't throw well enough to be an @entity14 quarterback . if he does sign with the @entity1 , he will be reunited with offensive coordinator @entity42 , who was the head coach of the @entity43 when they drafted @entity8 in the first round in 2010 . he will also get an opportunity to learn from starting quarterback @entity47 , who in 14 years has won three @entity48 and been the @entity14 's most valuable player twice . @entity8 played for the @entity30 in 2012 , rarely taking snaps but sometimes playing other positions in specialty formations on offense . he also played on the punting unit . the @entity1 released @entity55 , a backup quarterback , on monday . @entity14 players often have to pass a physical before they sign with a team .	@entity22:Foxborough	@entity23:Massachusetts	@entity1:Patriots	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Christian	@entity27:Stacey James	@entity25:Bill Belichick	@entity39:Tebowing	@entity8:Tebow	@entity30:Jets	@entity15:ESPN	@entity19:Heisman Trophy	@entity47:Tom Brady	@entity42:Josh McDaniels	@entity43:Denver	@entity14:NFL	@entity48:Super Bowls	@entity55:Mike Kafka
he says @entity16 has sights on states like @entity76 , @placeholder ; it could well seize @entity52	@entity72	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 was rightly shocked by the brutal , videotaped murder of @entity4 journalist @entity3 . but we should not have been surprised . the @entity6 , as the jihadist group calls itself , has murdered , raped and savaged its way across borders in the @entity10 and into the headlines as the latest terrorist foe from the region . @entity3 's murder not only gives terrorist stature to @entity16 but also , if it draws @entity4 ground troops into the fight , will have given @entity16 a recruiting bonanza . so the @entity4 response requires , not just a set of airstrikes in revenge , but serious strategic calculation . the @entity4 must build a coordinated regional response -- diplomatic , economic and military -- with ground troops from our regional allies and friends , and with possible @entity4 support with intelligence , logistics and airstrikes . but we can not fight this war for our @entity36 friends in the region . despite its pretensions , @entity16 is not yet a state . it was initially a group of fighters funded , armed and assisted by groups or governments opposing @entity44 president @entity43 . but its call for a caliphate governed by extremist interpretations of @entity49 law precisely echoes @entity52 @entity51 teaching , and is magnetic to disaffected , vulnerable young people . thus far @entity16 has perhaps 20,000 to 40,000 fighters or more , some heavy equipment , cash , oil , and a stunned , subdued population numbering perhaps a few million now suffering under extreme @entity49 law . it is not , at this point , an existential military threat to an alerted @entity63 , backed by @entity64 ( and the @entity4 ) , or the @entity65 , supported by @entity4 airpower . while it has challenged @entity43 's forces in @entity44 , it is more focused on carving out its territory in northern @entity44 , destabilizing @entity72 , and probably preparing for bolder moves against other states in the region , such as @entity76 . who is the @entity16 ? @entity16 fighters , including perhaps a few thousand alienated young people from @entity80 , the @entity81 , or @entity1 , do pose a terrorist threat far beyond the territory occupied by @entity16 . governments are anxiously screening travelers and seeking to block , intern , or otherwise isolate these potential terrorists when they depart @entity44 . this is difficult , but our homeland security is far stronger than it was a decade ago . the @entity4 , at least , should be able to handle this very serious threat but if @entity16 is allowed to consolidate its gains , build its forces , spread its tentacles of terror and subversion , then it will pose a serious threat to @entity72 , @entity76 and the principal @entity99 states in the region , particularly @entity52 . map : where is @entity16 ? @entity52 must recognize that it will eventually become the primary target of @entity16 . it controls the most holy sites of @entity36 , and by its adherence to , promotion and export of extremist interpretations of @entity36 , @entity52 is uniquely vulnerable to the @entity16 's moral suasion . massive purchases of @entity112 arms will help only if the @entity52 armed forces and populace remain loyal to the @entity52 government . for @entity52 , this time , there 's no safety in underwriting the services of others from outside the region . ultimately , it will have to be the @entity52 people themselves , their ruling family and their clergy who rally to defeat the threat of @entity16 . make no mistake : the latent threat is that @entity16 could seize control in @entity52 , with all its oil , revenues , and modern weaponry . therefore , coordinated action against @entity16 is urgent . but because @entity16 's motive force is primarily religious , and because the @entity4 armed forces are neither linguistically nor culturally best adapted for a sustained fight in the region , we should be wary of committing major land forces . opinion : how @entity4 can help @entity44 drive out @entity16 the @entity4 has learned the hard way that @entity112 armies inflame extremists and serve as recruiting magnets for terrorists . instead , other nations , and particularly @entity52 and other @entity99 states , must put their soldiers forward , and bear the brunt of the fighting . the @entity4 can use diplomacy and economic assistance , and it can strike using airpower , or special forces , to reinforce the efforts of our allies , but we can not fight a religious war as proxies for our @entity36 friends in the region . 5 key questions in the fight against @entity16 the @entity10 is approaching its moment of truth , particularly for @entity52 . having exported and promoted extremist @entity99 religious ideology , @entity52 must face up to the threat posed by its own , even more extremist progeny . it must summon the courage to take a firm stand now , before @entity16 becomes even stronger . for the @entity4 there is nothing to be gained by delay . we must work urgently , behind the scenes , to shape an effective regional response , in coordination with our friends and allies , now .	@entity80:Europe	@entity81:Caucasus	@entity112:Western	@entity3:Foley	@entity1:North America	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Islamic State	@entity4:U.S.	@entity36:Islamic	@entity52:Saudi Arabia	@entity51:Wahhabi	@entity76:Jordan	@entity72:Lebanon	@entity16:ISIS	@entity10:Mideast	@entity99:Sunni	@entity180:Clark	@entity63:Baghdad	@entity44:Syria	@entity43:al-Assad	@entity64:Iran	@entity65:Kurds	@entity49:Sharia
@entity3 president @entity2 met his @placeholder counterpart @entity4	@entity5	( @entity0 ) -- the meeting on tuesday between @entity3 president @entity2 and his @entity5 counterpart , @entity4 , marks the beginning of a new phase in the conflict between the two countries . military analysts say that the date by which @entity2 could have safely hoped to initiate and complete a full scale invasion of @entity5 before the onset of winter has already passed , so the threat of an open military confrontation has receded and there is space to give diplomacy a chance . yet it would be premature to conclude that jaw - jaw is about to replace war - war entirely . if there are powerful forces driving both sides to the negotiating table , there are also major differences that continue to keep them apart . we can expect a tense and difficult winter ahead . the main reason @entity2 is now willing to explore a negotiated solution is that @entity35 sanctions are beginning to bite . currency instability , accelerating capital flight and vanishing growth rates all point to a deep and sustained recession if the current political uncertainty persists and @entity35 pressure is maintained . as @entity2 noted in a recent speech , @entity3 can not fence itself off from the outside world . there is n't a go it alone option if @entity3 is denied access to global markets and finance . @entity2 therefore needs to find a way of normalizing relations with the @entity54 and bringing sanctions to an end in exchange for stabilizing the situation and allowing @entity5 to function as a country . without this , patriotic fervor is likely to subside in the face of economic hardship and record approval ratings will quickly return to their pre-crisis lows . closely related to this is the fate of @entity68 , the territory annexed by @entity3 earlier this year . the picture emerging from the peninsula is one of steep price rises and acute material shortages as the problem of resupplying the territory without land access from @entity5 becomes apparent . a successful @entity3 invasion of eastern and southern @entity5 would have resolved that issue at a stroke , but with that option apparently off the table @entity2 faces real difficulties . what many saw as a geopolitical masterstroke in march is set to become a major financial burden stretching years into the future unless some kind of agreement can be struck . @entity88 and the @entity54 will never recognize the annexation of @entity68 , but arrangements for the supply of water , energy and other goods will undoubtedly form part of the wider negotiation . for @entity4 the issues are equally stark . the economic outlook for @entity5 remains dire unless the crisis can be brought to an end and the country is able to function to some extent as a single unit once again . @entity5 forces have made significant gains at the expense of the separatists over the last couple of months , but @entity88 probably does n't have the means to bring the insurgency to an end by military means alone . @entity3 's capacity to destabilize the east remains immense and recent steps to reinforce the separatists and " @entity120 " its leadership suggest that @entity118 is preparing to play the long game . energy is another area of concern for @entity4 . in the absence of a new agreement on gas supply from @entity3 , reserves will probably be insufficient to cover demand in the cold months ahead . reverse flow from the @entity54 might help to mitigate the problem , but a harsh winter would leave @entity5 badly exposed . although both sides face major pressure to reach a negotiated settlement , they remain far apart on the substance . @entity3 sees @entity5 as part of its sphere of " privileged interests " and is determined to prevent the country moving closer to the @entity54 . @entity88 wants to maintain an independent foreign policy , including the option of deeper integration with the @entity54 . the terrain on which this struggle is being played out is the debate over @entity5 's constitutional future and relationship between the center and the regions in particular . in the absence of a friendly government in @entity88 , @entity3 is promoting a form of federalism that in reality looks more like confederalism . this would give @entity3 - speaking regions of the east control not only over their own domestic affairs , such as education , public services and the local economy , but also the right to determine their own foreign alignments , security structures and possibly border controls . the ideal model for @entity3 is the @entity170 that brought the conflict in @entity172 to an end in 1995 . this created two constitutionally autonomous entities , each with a veto over foreign policy and other major national decisions . @entity3 has been able to forge close ties to @entity181 and relies on it to block @entity172 's membership of @entity183 . for understandable reasons the government in @entity88 is unwilling to countenance an agreement on this basis . although it is prepared to cede much greater autonomy to the regions in crucial matters like language and education , it recognizes that @entity2 - style " federalism " would put a block closer ties to the @entity197 and become a ramp for the soft integration of its eastern regions into a @entity3 sphere of influence . @entity4 is under intense pressure , especially from @entity206 , to negotiate some kind of decentralized arrangement , but the separatists and their @entity3 sponsors show no signs of lowering their demands to the point where an agreement might be achievable . although an end to the crisis is to be hoped for , the starting point of @entity217 diplomacy should be that a quick solution is unlikely and that the reason for this is @entity118 's unreasonable expectation of a veto over @entity5 's future . @entity206 should stop pressuring @entity5 's leaders to consider proposals that would effectively lead to the break up of their country . instead effort should be focused on strengthening @entity5 's sovereignty and long - term bargaining power in relation to @entity3 . measures to increase energy supplies , provide economic support and strengthen @entity5 's defense capacities over the difficult winter months ahead should be priorities . at the same time , economic pressure on @entity3 should be maintained and stepped up . this is a battle of wills and @entity2 wo n't reconsider his position unless the @entity54 is able to demonstrate the resolve needed to prevail . @entity245 : to punish @entity3 , @entity217 must be prepared to suffer @entity3 sanctions : which foods are off @entity3 menus ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .	@entity3:Russian	@entity2:Vladimir Putin	@entity0:CNN	@entity35:Western	@entity5:Ukraine	@entity4:Petro Poroshenko	@entity197:EU	@entity181:Republika Srpska	@entity183:NATO	@entity251:David Clark	@entity245:Nina Dos Santos	@entity217:Europe	@entity255:Russia Foundation	@entity68:Crimea	@entity54:West	@entity88:Kiev	@entity170:Dayton Agreement	@entity118:Moscow	@entity206:Germany	@entity120:Ukrainianise	@entity172:Bosnia
@entity2 report says one third of @placeholder economy is opium - based	@entity4	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- poppy production in @entity4 is at record levels and is threatening the government and security there , the @entity2 said in a report on worldwide drug sales and production . in a photo from last year , villagers tend to opium poppies in southern @entity4 .

( i ca n't think of why that might be ) . so you 'd think that , at a minimum , the house where he lives would be surrounded by a fence that was hard to climb over . but as @entity21 , the director of the @entity22 , noted in testimony today before the @entity24 , six people have successfully scaled the fence this year alone . the reason for the hearing was one particular fence jumper , an apparently disturbed man named @entity29 . on september 19 , @entity29 not only scaled the fence , he ran across the lawn , through the @entity32 's front door ( which was unlocked ) , got past a @entity22 agent stationed at the door , went through the entry hall and into the @entity36 , and was finally apprehended near the door to the @entity38 . we also learned this week details of an even more troubling incident in 2011 , in which a man in a car fired seven shots that hit the @entity32 . it turned out that in the moments after , agents were told by a supervisor to stand down because the sounds they had heard were not in fact gunshots ; the damage from the bullets was n't discovered until four days later . security lapse : armed man was in elevator with @entity5 the @entity22 would say that thousands of times a year , agents successfully protect the president , other @entity61 officials , and foreign dignitaries , both in the @entity61 and around the world , which is perfectly true . but at a time when we spend billions of dollars every year on what has come to be known as " security theater " -- procedures and practices whose effect is less to make us safe than to give the appearance of security -- this is one thing you 'd think they 'd be able to get right . indeed , protecting the president is one of the few areas where the danger of overreaction is limited . the threats are real , and the task is specific . when it comes to the public at large , we 've overreacted plenty in the past , particularly since the september 11 attacks . we all take our shoes off in airports , show @entity87 to get into office buildings , and are generally treated as though we are constantly in imminent danger from terrorists -- when the truth is that there are few things less likely to kill you . and that 's not to mention the enormous apparatus of surveillance the government has built over that time , the details of which we still do n't fully understand . meanwhile , crime has been on a decades - long decline , while gun advocates tell everyone to buy more weaponry lest the barbarian horde attack their homes . in short , we fear the wrong things and overreact to threats that are real , but small . while the days when any citizen with a complaint could walk into the @entity32 and give the president a piece of his mind are long past , we still want our leaders to come out and shake our hands . we want to be able to tour the @entity119 . the area within view of the @entity32 is the site for protests , speeches , and innumerable tourists taking photos , all of which we want to maintain . if we wanted , we could lock down the @entity32 -- eliminate tours for the public , put up 40 - foot steel and concrete barriers , maybe park some tanks on the lawn . during today 's hearing , rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , argued that anyone scaling the fence and running toward the @entity32 should be shot , which would mean a lot of bullets flying outward toward those tourists . this incident was certainly disturbing , and the congressional pressure the @entity22 is now receiving may lead to some salutary change . but just as we 're now questioning the tragedies large and small that come from police officers all over the country treating every citizen like a soldier in an enemy army , we should be careful about not going too far in turning the @entity32 into a fortress . we could make the building impenetrable , but but that would represent the loss of something valuable . by all means , the @entity22 should examine its procedures to make sure nothing like this happens again . they should put up a better fence . maybe keeping the front door of the @entity32 locked would n't be a bad idea . but this is a good time to remember that there 's a tension in any democracy between security and openness , and in @entity61 , of late -- the occasional screw - up notwithstanding -- too much openness is n't our problem .	@entity3:Earth	@entity22:Secret Service	@entity1:President of the United States	@entity0:CNN	@entity24:House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Congressional	@entity5:Obama	@entity36:East Room	@entity21:Julia Pierson	@entity38:Green Room	@entity29:Gonzales	@entity172:Paul Waldman	@entity32:White House	@entity87:IDs	@entity135:R-Utah	@entity134:Chaffetz	@entity119:Capitol Building	@entity61:America

@entity6 : at least 40,000 migrants have died since 2000 , more than half trying to reach @placeholder	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- every day , refugees and migrants risk their lives as they seek a new life . now , a new report from the @entity6 has put a figure to the number of victims : at least 40,000 deaths since 2000 . more than half of those who died -- some 22,000 -- were trying to get to @entity13 , the @entity6 said . nearly 6,000 more migrant deaths occurred along the @entity17 - @entity16 border and another 3,000 deaths from migration routes including @entity21 's @entity20 and the waters of the @entity23 , according to the group 's research . " our message is blunt : migrants are dying who need not , " said @entity6 director general @entity26 . " it is time to do more than count the number of victims . it is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants . " the @entity6 report , published monday and titled " @entity38 -- tracking lives lost during @entity43 , " puts the number of those killed trying to reach @entity13 at nearly 4,000 since the start of 2013 . more than three - quarters of those victims died in the first nine months of this year , many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the @entity50 and @entity21 across the @entity51 . two shipwrecks off the tiny @entity54 island of @entity55 last october , in which more than 400 migrants died , made headlines around the world and prompted calls for action . @entity54 's navy launched @entity62 to try to find and rescue stranded migrants . nonetheless , there have been many more shipwrecks and many more deaths in the year since . just this month , witnesses told the @entity6 that as many as 500 people had died , including women and children , when human traffickers intentionally sunk their boat in the @entity51 off @entity73 . only 11 survivors have been found . some of those on board were fleeing conflict in @entity78 or @entity79 ; others were looking for the chance to escape persecution or poverty and build a better life . @entity85 and @entity78 made up the largest number of those arriving in @entity54 so far this year , the @entity6 said . @entity54 navy finds dozens of bodies in migrant boat @entity90 : ' survival test ' rights group @entity90 released a new report tuesday , accusing the @entity93 and its member states of " imposing a survival test on refugees and migrants . " its research puts the number of those killed in the @entity51 so far this year at at least 2,500 people . " in the absence of safe and regular routes into @entity13 , accepting the risk of drowning in the central @entity51 is the price many refugees and migrants must pay to access asylum or job opportunities , " it said . the group calls for @entity13 to do more , pointing out that while @entity54 has shouldered the burden of migrant rescues in the @entity51 over the past yea , it is unwilling to do so indefinitely . this is partly because it then takes responsibility for those rescued , who often want to reach other @entity13 nations . if @entity54 does scale down its operation without a new system in place or a better response by the @entity93 border agency , @entity129 , many more lives will be lost at sea , the human rights group cautions . @entity90 also warns that with the current unrest in the @entity50 and long - running conflicts elsewhere , the number of people trying to reach @entity13 is unlikely to fall . tens of thousands of people are trapped in increasingly lawless @entity138 , a major transit nation , and are seeking a way out , the report said . with the sealing off of land routes via @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , many see no option but to embark on the dangerous journey by sea . " in 2013 , 48 % of all irregular entrants and 63 % of all those arriving irregularly by sea to the @entity93 came from @entity78 , @entity85 , @entity152 and @entity153 , countries torn by conflict and widespread human rights abuses , " the report said . ' @entity159 ' traffickers ram boat full of migrants and kill 500 , survivors say ' @entity163 response ' to migrants the @entity6 warns that the true number of migrants killed is likely to be " considerably higher " than the number documented for its report . " although vast sums of money are spent collecting migration and border control data , very few agencies collect and publish data on migrant deaths , " said @entity6 research chief @entity169 . many migrants disappear and die without a trace as they make perilous journeys across deserts or seas . " the paradox is that at a time when one in seven people around the world are migrants in one form or another , we are seeing an extraordinarily harsh response to migration in the developed world , " said @entity26 . " limited opportunities for safe and regular migration drive would - be migrants into the hands of smugglers , feeding an unscrupulous trade that threatens the lives of desperate people . we need to put an end to this cycle . " undocumented migrants are not criminals . they are human beings in need of protection and assistance , and deserving respect . " by highlighting the awful toll of migration , the @entity6 hopes to discourage would - be migrants from falling into the hands of unscrupulous criminal gangs and traffickers , as well as pressuring developed nations to change their policies to create more safe avenues of legal migration . @entity17 - @entity16 border an estimated 230 migrants died between january and september of this year trying to cross the @entity17 - @entity16 border , the report said . because information from the region is so patchy , the figures do n't include the likely several hundred people who die in @entity224 each year as they make their way north to the border . between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2013 , a total of 6,029 migrants were found dead on the @entity17 side of the border , the report said . about 100 lives a year have been lost on average in the seas bordering @entity233 , although the number has dropped off significantly this year , the @entity6 said . most of those who travel by boat depart from @entity237 , with the vast majority in recent years coming from @entity152 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 . @entity0 's @entity242 contributed to this report .	@entity23:Indian Ocean	@entity20:Sahara Desert	@entity21:North Africa	@entity26:Swing	@entity129:Frontex	@entity159:Laughing	@entity85:Eritrea	@entity153:Somalia	@entity152:Afghanistan	@entity233:Australia	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:IOM	@entity239:Iraq	@entity51:Mediterranean	@entity50:Middle East	@entity79:Gaza	@entity78:Syria	@entity55:Lampedusa	@entity54:Italy	@entity90:Amnesty International	@entity73:Malta	@entity17:U.S.	@entity16:Mexico	@entity13:Europe	@entity145:Bulgaria	@entity38:Fatal Journeys	@entity242:Lindsay Isaac	@entity241:Sri Lanka	@entity240:Iran	@entity93:EU	@entity237:Indonesia	@entity144:Greece	@entity163:Harsh	@entity224:Central America	@entity143:Turkey	@entity169:Frank Laczko	@entity43:Migration	@entity62:Operation Mare Nostrum	@entity138:Libya

@entity6 , inventor of the @entity8 video camera , launche new business @placeholder	@entity18	( @entity0 ) -- what would you do after @entity3 killed your beloved product ? for @entity6 , the inventor of the @entity8 video camera , the answer was simple : start a venture - backed nationwide chain of grilled cheese sandwich joints . that may sound like @entity12 has lost his marbles , but bear with us . @entity12 's genius , as shown in the highly popular @entity8 , is creating super-easy , mass - produced technology . with his new business , @entity18 , he 's done that twice over . buy a grilled cheese on your smartphone , and you get a qr code to swipe in store when you arrive . the back - end software ensures that you get a piping hot grilled cheese in your hands within 60 seconds of checking in . @entity12 has also invested a lot of effort on making his grilled cheese hardware easy and effective . he tapped @entity34 appliance giant @entity33 to create a brand - new grill with a built - in microwave . it nukes the cheese for 15 seconds , then toasts the bread for another 30 seconds . we can confirm that the resulting sandwiches , doing the rounds here at the @entity44 conference , were uniformly tasty . win or lose , you ca n't deny that @entity12 has put a lot of thought into this scheme . he found a breadmaker in @entity51 whose bread was kneaded in such a way that it created air bubbles for the cheese to fill . he 's pairing different kinds of bread with different kinds of cheese , as well as simple but tasty soups ( the melt 's only other sale item , apart from @entity63 ) . sandwiches will go for $ 5 apiece , or $ 8 with soup . " we 're selling nostalgia and happiness , " @entity12 told @entity0 . " grilled cheese makes people happy . " evidently , his backers at @entity73 agreed . @entity12 wo n't say how much funding he received , but he plans to start more than 500 melt locations in the next four years . each store will cost between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million . you do the math. famed vc @entity80 is sitting on the board , as is @entity84 retail head @entity83 , and the first handful of stores will open in @entity87 in august . some will stay open as late as 2 a.m. , a big deal in a town that largely shuts down at 10 p.m. another reason the whole @entity18 concept might work out better than expected ? one word : calories . put a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of soup next to just about any other fast food option , and it 's going to look like a plate of greens . @entity100 may be able to offer you online ordering ( and @entity100 , by the way , is a $ 9 billion business ) , but good luck working off the 500 - odd extra calories a burrito is going to give you compared to the @entity18 's offerings . are you buying it ? is @entity109 ready for high - tech grilled cheese ? let us know in the comments . see the original article on @entity0 © 2010 @entity0 . all rights reserved .	@entity3:Cisco	@entity44:D9	@entity33:Electrolux	@entity0:MASHABLE.com	@entity6:Jonathan Kaplan	@entity8:Flip	@entity100:Chipotle	@entity18:The Melt	@entity80:Michael Moritz	@entity51:Chicago	@entity83:Ron Johnson	@entity84:Apple	@entity12:Kaplan	@entity87:San Francisco	@entity109:America	@entity63:Crackerjacks	@entity73:Sequoia Capital	@entity34:European
@placeholder - led airstrikes are aimed at cutting off the group 's funding	@entity71	on the southern edge of @entity1 , rolling brown pastoral hills slope gently to the @entity4 border , with small towns like this one dotting the horizon . the calm on this side of the border , however , belies the scene on the other side . just across the border in northern @entity4 , the @entity13 extremist group known as @entity14 is fighting a full - tilt battle in its effort to capture and control new territory , part of its push to create a sprawling @entity13 caliphate , or separate @entity13 state , modeled on the first caliphate that spread across the region in the centuries following the death of the @entity27 around 640 ad . as @entity14 fighters expand their control , it is in the border region , in villages like @entity33 , where the @entity34 can make some of the money it needs to finance its wars . oil - smuggling operations involving millions of barrels have recently been uncovered . the oil comes from wells and refineries that @entity14 has taken over inside northern @entity43 and northern @entity4 , and until very recently it was easy to smuggle it into this quiet part of southern @entity1 . one reason is that cheap , smuggled oil is a much - prized commodity in @entity1 , where oil is so expensive that it almost does n't matter who is selling it , even if it 's your enemy . in @entity55 , @entity1 , just a half hour 's drive away , gasoline costs roughly $ 7.50 per gallon . growing international alarm over @entity14 expansion and the group 's increasingly visible atrocities -- such as beheadings of @entity63 journalists and aid workers , the videos of which are disseminated online -- have brought renewed pressure on @entity14 and its funding methods on the borders . @entity71 - led coalition forces just a week ago attacked and destroyed many @entity14 oil facilities , precisely to cut off the group 's funding . but the border smuggling is only one way that @entity14 generates money . the @entity78 does not have hard figures that it can make public on the group 's wealth but says it believes @entity14 takes in millions of dollars a month . sources familiar with the subject say that @entity14 ' " burn ' rate " -- how much the group spends -- is huge , including salaries , weapons and other expenses . for @entity14 ' oil sales , sources told @entity90 , the group probably makes between $ 1 million and $ 2 million per day , but probably on the lower end . @entity92 , director of the @entity93 on @entity94 at the @entity95 in @entity96 , calls @entity14 " the best - financed group we 've ever seen . " opinion : will @entity71 strikes hurt @entity14 ' oil riches ? @entity92 is a national expert on terrorism and its financing , working previously on intelligence and analysis at the @entity78 and the @entity107 . @entity14 , @entity92 says , is funded like no other traditional terrorist group in the past . besides revenue from oil smuggling , the group receives money through donations from wealthy sympathizers in countries including @entity117 and @entity118 . but the group has another method of funding itself : through organized crime within the territories it has vanquished and now controls . the group , says @entity92 , was born among crooks and thugs from a broken @entity43 , and at its root it is a criminal enterprise . " we should n't be surprised , " says @entity92 . " remember , the @entity127 called @entity14 is what used to be called the @entity14 , and @entity129 in @entity43 , the @entity130 , the @entity14 ; it 's all the same . and they were always primarily financed through domestic criminal activity within the borders of @entity43 . " @entity92 says @entity14 operates as a massive organized crime group with virtually no law enforcement to rein it in -- and its long history has allowed it to set roots and develop over many years . it means @entity14 can demand money from people wherever it has established control . want to do business in @entity14 - controlled territory ? you pay a tax . want to move a truck down an @entity14 - controlled highway ? you pay a toll . villagers in @entity14 territory reportedly are charged and pay for just about everything . why is @entity14 so successful at luring @entity63 ? " there are reports that people in @entity154 ( @entity43 ) who want to take money out of their own bank accounts need to make a ' voluntary ' -- not so voluntary -- donation to the @entity127 , to @entity14 , " @entity92 says . " so controlling territory has given them opportunities that other groups like @entity129 , who have n't controlled real territory , have n't had . " it is the centuries - honored tradition of conquest and control : what you take is what you have . in @entity154 , @entity14 looted the central bank and other smaller provincial banks , resulting in a financial windfall of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars . @entity14 formed in the void created by the pullout of @entity71 troops and the retreating @entity43 army , says @entity178 , the executive director of the @entity179 in @entity96 . in the lawlessness that followed , he says , @entity14 took over , robbed banks , began taxing and extorting the population , and now funds its war and expansion across @entity43 and @entity4 almost independently . @entity178 lobbies @entity71 lawmakers for more support of moderate @entity4 rebels who are now fighting both @entity14 and the @entity4 regime of @entity190 . he recently helped bring together several @entity192 delegations to meet with moderate rebel groups on the border as part of that effort . coalition airstrikes , he says , are n't enough to destroy the kind of self - financing mob that @entity14 has become . instead , you need to take back the territory and restore civil order . " they 're taxing the people ; that 's a huge revenue , " he says of @entity14 . " but not only that . they also control sort of the breadbasket of @entity4 , in terms of @entity210 ( their defacto capital ) . they 've got the cotton and the wheat and all these other things . all of these serve as sort of economic and powerhouse or funding for @entity14 . " fighters who are willing to do battle against @entity14 are frustrated that the @entity71 has not helped them more , @entity178 says , pointing out that it is largely a decision for the @entity71 president . " it is a @entity228 decision , " @entity178 said . " and it always has been . and i think the @entity228 is slowly moving in the right direction . i can tell you that the policy that the @entity228 has right now -- if it had this policy three years ago , there would have never been an @entity14 , and we probably would have gotten rid of the @entity190 regime . " the @entity237 administration has heard this criticism before and counters that the president has been calculating in his response to the situation in @entity4 . " it 's not difficult to contemplate or imagine a scenario where if the @entity71 had put -- dumped a bunch of arms into that country three years ago , that members of @entity14 or other extremist groups would be toting @entity71 arms as they wage their campaign of violence throughout that region , " @entity228 press secretary @entity242 said last month , referring to @entity14 by another acronym .

the victory extends @placeholder 's winning run in the @entity5 to 11 matches	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 recovered from going a goal behind to beat rivals @entity3 3 - 2 on sunday to return to the top of the @entity5 ahead of @entity6 . but they did not have things their own way at the @entity10 and went into the interval trailing after a flowing @entity3 move saw the ball reach former @entity1 striker @entity14 , who curled home a delightful shot to give the visitors the lead . but @entity1 were a different side after the break and levelled in the 49th minute when @entity21 netted from close range . and six minutes later , the home side were ahead when defender @entity24 -- who like @entity21 moved to @entity3 from @entity25 last pre-season -- superbly cut inside his marker before stroking the ball home . @entity3 made it 3 - 1 in the 62nd minute when top scorer @entity29 took advantage of a defensive mix - up to fire home . however , the scoring was still not over and @entity21 turned from hero to villain when handling the ball in the area , with @entity36 slotting home the resulting penalty . @entity36 missed a golden chance to level in the final minute when firing into the side - netting , but @entity1 held on to move ahead of @entity6 , who scraped a narrow 1 - 0 victory at @entity42 on saturday , on goal difference . the victory was @entity1 's 11th in succession and continued their recent domination over their city rivals , with @entity3 not winning a derby match since 1999 . in other matches , @entity50 's recent poor run of form continued with a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity54 , for whom veteran @entity56 @entity55 came off the substitutes ' bench to score a superb third goal . struggling @entity61 thumped @entity62 3 - 0 in a battle of the bottom two clubs , while @entity66 's @entity65 hopes took a knock after they slumped 3 - 1 at home to @entity69 .	@entity21:Alonso	@entity24:Alvaro Arbeloa	@entity25:Liverpool	@entity29:Gonzalo Higuain	@entity82:Spanish	@entity3:Atletico	@entity1:Real	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Barcelona	@entity5:Primera Liga	@entity36:Forlan	@entity50:Sevilla	@entity56:Frenchman	@entity55:Robert Pires	@entity54:Villarreal	@entity14:Jose Antonio Reyes	@entity10:Bernabeu	@entity42:Mallorca	@entity69:Getafe	@entity66:Deportivo La Coruna	@entity65:Champions League	@entity62:Valladolid	@entity61:Xerez
@placeholder had said his account of @entity6 incident was accurate	@entity8	( @entity0 ) it was a lawsuit pitting two larger - than - life personalities against each other -- former pro wrestler - turned - @entity7 gov. @entity6 and ex-navy seal sniper @entity8 . on tuesday , @entity6 was victorious as a federal jury in @entity7 awarded him more than $ 1.8 million , deciding that @entity8 's 2012 best - selling autobiography , " @entity11 " defamed @entity6 . " i do n't feel great . i mean i feel good over the fact that i 've been vindicated , that now they know the story was not true . it was fabricated from @entity16 , " @entity6 told @entity0 affiliate @entity15 . the suit centered on a passage in which @entity8 , who was slain in 2013 , described fighting with a man in a @entity21 bar in 2006 during the wake for seal @entity23 , who was killed in @entity25 in 2006 . @entity8 wrote that he hit the man after he said that the @entity26 " deserve to lose a few , " according to numerous media reports , including @entity0 affiliate @entity28 . in later interviews , @entity8 said he was referring to @entity6 . in the suit , @entity6 denied making the statements in the book . @entity6 filed the suit before @entity8 's death , according to the @entity34 . at his deposition in 2012 , @entity8 continued to insist his book accurately described his clash with @entity6 . " he was complaining about the war , that we should n't be there , " @entity8 testified . " complaining about @entity41 , that , you know , @entity41 was a war criminal . how we were killing innocent men and women and children overseas .

" the station said her attorney told reporters they might appeal the verdict . some are blasting @entity6 on social media because they feel @entity6 's actions are tantamount to suing a slain service member 's widow . several are posting unflattering photo - shopped images of @entity6 and calling him names . on wednesday , @entity70 spokeswoman @entity69 told @entity0 that the publisher is removing passages which refer to @entity6 . @entity8 's killing in 2013 in 2013 , a @entity75 veteran was accused of shooting and killing @entity8 , 38 , and @entity8 's friend @entity76 at a @entity78 gun range near @entity79 . ex-navy sniper , another military vet , killed at range @entity0 reported at the time that @entity84 county sheriff @entity83 said the @entity87 suspect , 25 - year - old @entity85 , admitted to his sister that he shot the men . @entity85 did n't explain to her why he did it , @entity83 said . at the time of the shooting , @entity83 said that @entity85 's mother , a longtime schoolteacher , " may have reached out to mr. @entity8 to try and help her son .

@placeholder eases through in women 's draw	@entity147	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 champion @entity1 slumped to a tame defeat in the fading gloom of a rain - hit opening monday at @entity6 to @entity8 outsider @entity7 . third seed @entity1 , who won the @entity10 at the start of the clay court season , showed little of that form as he surrendered 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 0 on @entity14 to the world number 41 . the @entity17 number one looked to restoring equilibrium when he took a hard - fought second set , but was outplayed in the remaining two to suffer an embarrassing first round exit in the second grand slam of the season . he saved one match point a 0 - 5 down in the fourth but then completed a match of 61 unforced errors by hitting a backhand long . @entity7 raised his arms in triumph while @entity1 trudged off after the final action on the show courts after a weather - hit second day . " it was n't good at all , i kept trying to find my game , anything to get back in it but i just need to take a few days off now and figure out what happened , " @entity1 told gathered reporters after his defeat . " he 's a really good player but it was me , i could n't find solutions and it was just terrible and a really big disappointment . " earlier the two favorites for the men 's title , eight - time champion @entity47 and world number two @entity49 eased their way through between the rain showers . @entity47 dropped only three games in a ruthless demolition of @entity55 @entity54 , while @entity49 could afford to delight the @entity14 crowd with an impromptu chat with a ball boy . the 27 - year - old @entity59 was sitting under an umbrella during a break in play when he gestured to the young man to join him . they sat for several minutes talking and @entity65 even offered his new friend a drink before clinking bottles with him . the crowd lapped it up and burst into applause and after his 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 4 demolition of @entity74 's @entity73 , @entity49 revealed the subject of the conversation . " we had a nice chat , " he told the official @entity78 website . " he 's a tennis player , so i asked him how long he 's playing , and , you know , how he 's enjoying his time as a ball kid . " it was a nice , fun time , something unusual for the grand slams . he accepted the offer to sit down , which i did n't think he would do , but he did . so he 's very spontaneous little boy , and i hope i see him my next match . " that will be against @entity93 @entity92 , with second seed @entity49 predicting a tougher test . defending champion @entity47 was even less troubled by @entity54 , who has not won a match on the @entity97 all season and but for a spell in the second set did not muster much resistance . it was the top seed 's 60th win at the @entity78 and he later shrugged off suggestions he had been snubbed by not playing on the main showpiece court of @entity14 and instead placed on @entity106 . a fellow professional had called the decision " bizarre " but @entity47 claimed not to be bothered by the scheduling . " it does n't really matter a lot , " he said . " @entity6 is a pleasure for me , is a really honor , and is a special feeling . so all the memories at this place give me are unforgettable . " and does n't matter if it 's @entity118 or @entity106 or another court , " added the @entity116 . @entity47 has suffered shock defeats in the clay court season and came close to losing in the final of the @entity123 to @entity124 until the @entity126 player succumbed to a back problem . great things were still expected of @entity124 at the clay court grand slam , but the ninth seed did not appear to have shrugged off his injury as he went out 7 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 2 to @entity134 @entity133 in his opening match . " it 's tough for me , but i guess this is my tennis life , you know . i have to take care of my body and injury will come again , for sure . so i have to mentally be ready , " he said . " i have to do whatever i can do to get healthy . " in the women 's draw there was an easy first round win for seventh @entity147 as she beat fellow @entity149 @entity148 6 - 1 6 - 2 . @entity147 , who lost last year 's final to @entity150 , needed only 27 minutes to wrap up the opening set and carried on her domination into the second . she will now face @entity156 's 2010 @entity155 semi-finalist @entity154 for a place in the third round but @entity150 looms as a possible quarterfinal opponent for the 2012 champion . watch : @entity147 's love affair with @entity162	@entity116:Spaniard	@entity134:Slovak	@entity150:Williams	@entity156:Bulgaria	@entity133:Martin Klizan	@entity154:Tsvetana Pironkova	@entity97:ATP Tour	@entity2:Australian Open	@entity1:Wawrinka	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Guillermo Garcia-Lopez	@entity6:Roland Garros	@entity8:Spanish	@entity92:Jeremy Chardy	@entity78:French Open	@entity55:Amerian	@entity54:Ginepri	@entity74:Portugal	@entity59:Serbian	@entity118:Chatrier	@entity73:Joao Sousa	@entity17:Swiss	@entity14:Philippe Chatrier	@entity10:Monte Carlo Masters	@entity106:Lenglen	@entity126:Japanese	@entity124:Nishikori	@entity93:Frenchman	@entity123:Madrid Masters	@entity155:Wimbledon	@entity162:Paris	@entity147:Maria Sharapova	@entity148:Ksenia Pervak	@entity149:Russian	@entity47:Rafael Nadal	@entity65:Djkovic	@entity49:Novak Djokovic
@placeholder 's new prime minister has promised citizens growth and prosperity	@entity2	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 want their version of the @entity4 . even the @entity5 will do . and so they have voted for a man who promises more for less : more development and growth , with less government and red tape . for @entity2 's 1.27 billion dreamers , their new prime minister @entity12 is a known commodity . his simple mandate is to do for @entity2 what he has done for the north western state of @entity19 in the last 12 years : conjure up @entity21 - levels of growth and prosperity . but for @entity12 's counterparts in @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , @entity2 's new leader is considered a wildcard . will he be aggressive , or a dove ? what is his foreign policy ? does he have a vision for @entity2 's place in the world ? there 's very little to go on . @entity12 has never addressed foreign policy at length ; @entity2 campaigns rarely involve debates on world affairs . few in @entity0 seem to have a clear sense of his plans . when i spoke with @entity46 , a former @entity2 minister now being touted as a top candidate to head the finance ministry , i got a telling response : " anyone who says they know @entity12 's plans , does n't really know anything . the ones who know wo n't talk . " so let 's start with the few signals we 've received from the man himself . reaching out to neighbors @entity12 has certainly begun with a flourish , scoring a coup in getting his @entity64 counterpart to attend his swearing - in . on monday , @entity66 became the first @entity64 prime minister in history to attend an @entity2 prime minister 's inauguration . the two men were photographed exchanging a firm handshake . @entity12 later tweeted that @entity66 had " shared some very emotional things " during their meeting . he elaborated with a story about how @entity66 's mother became emotional when watching @entity12 's mother offering him sweets . ( read the series of tweets here ) @entity12 's @entity83 account also highlights his early attempts to strengthen ties with his new counterparts . after his election , he announced to his 4.38 million followers congratulatory messages from @entity91 president @entity90 , @entity93 's @entity92 , @entity95 chancellor @entity94 , @entity97 's @entity96 , @entity99 's @entity98 , as well as leaders from @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and more . @entity105 got an especially lavish mention : " personally , i have a wonderful experience of working with @entity105 as [ chief minister of @entity19 . ] , " @entity12 tweeted . " i am sure we will take @entity2 - @entity105 ties to newer heights . " @entity105 's @entity112 follows only three people on @entity83 -- @entity12 , of course , is one of them . @entity83 diplomacy is not just about rhetoric -- there have been some early results , too . @entity121 president @entity120 tweeted sunday : " as a goodwill measure on the occasion of @ narendramodi 's swearing - in , president instructs officials to release @entity2 fishermen in custody . " none of the above sheds light on what kind of vision @entity12 has , but it is indeed a refreshing marker of proactive engagement -- the opposite of @entity2 's foreign policy in years gone by . in an excellent essay in foreign affairs last month , @entity138 described how @entity2 foreign policy in the last 50 years has been characterized " more by continuity than by change " -- irrespective of the party in power . ' non-alignment ' @entity2 's relations with major powers have stayed stable . broadly , there are two reasons behind this trend . one is @entity2 's historic pledge of " non-alignment " : the country 's first prime minister @entity154 founded the global @entity156 , a group of states agreeing to not align with major powers . the other reason is @entity2 's neglect of foreign policy planning from the very top : civil servants get little - to - no instruction from the prime minister 's office , and so have great levels of autonomy and wield significant power . the result is no clear vision from @entity0 , and a general stasis in @entity2 's relations with the world . it has often been pointed out that @entity2 has fewer diplomats than @entity176 , a country with a population 1/250th the size of @entity2 's . @entity2 has consistently punched below its weight despite aspiring to be a global player . will @entity12 change these trends ? again , it is difficult to read his mind . but turn again to what @entity12 has actually said . the writer @entity185 points out that @entity12 has repeatedly stated that foreign policy begins at home . this is not to suggest that @entity12 will be insular . instead , his relations with other countries will be driven by business needs and a sense of realism -- perhaps similar , in theory , to @entity21 's relations with @entity197 and @entity198 states . many writers and commentators have expressed fears about @entity12 's foreign policy on two main fronts . first , that he will channel his brand of @entity206 nationalism into friction with @entity64 . second , that he will use his prior history with @entity26 -- @entity12 's @entity91 visa was revoked in 2005 over a never - before - used religious freedoms act -- as a reason to snub the world 's biggest economy . on both fronts , we have no way of confirming those fears just yet . but with each passing day , we are witnessing an evolving @entity12 , a realist whose goal is to grow @entity219 and do business with anyone -- at home or abroad -- who can help achieve that goal . @entity12 's real test will be whether he can bring a longer - term vision to @entity2 's foreign policy planning . will he keep @entity0 non-aligned ? will he pivot further @entity228 ? will he help fulfil @entity90 's prediction that @entity2 and the @entity91 will form the 21st century 's defining partnership ? only @entity12 knows the answers . but if @entity2 foreign policy has so far not been driven by the prime minister 's office , i think we can now expect that strange quirk to change . for better or worse , prime minister @entity12 will take charge .	@entity21:China	@entity26:Washington	@entity27:Beijing	@entity28:Islamabad	@entity83:Twitter	@entity112:PM Shinzo Abe	@entity156:Non-Aligned Movement	@entity154:Jawaharlal Nehru	@entity2:India	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:New Delhi	@entity5:Chinese Dream	@entity198:African	@entity197:South Asian	@entity219:India Inc.	@entity92:PM Netanyahu	@entity91:U.S.	@entity90:Obama	@entity12:Modi	@entity176:Singapore	@entity19:Gujarat	@entity101:New Zealand	@entity102:Fiji	@entity103:Qatar	@entity104:Afghanistan	@entity105:Japan	@entity99:Russia	@entity98:Putin	@entity97:France	@entity96:Hollande	@entity95:German	@entity94:Angela Merkel	@entity93:Israel	@entity206:pro-Hindu	@entity120:Mahinda Rajapakse	@entity121:Sri Lankan	@entity228:East	@entity4:American Dream	@entity185:Dhruva Jaishanker	@entity46:Arun Shourie	@entity66:Sharif	@entity64:Pakistan	@entity138:Manjari Chatterjee Miller
@entity5 appoint former @entity23 coach @placeholder as @entity8 's replacement	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- football 's managerial merry - go - round swung into action tuesday as both @entity4 and @entity5 ended months of speculation by appointing new coaches . @entity8 has left @entity5 to take over at @entity4 , while former @entity11 national team coach @entity9 has replaced the @entity12 in @entity13 . nine - time @entity15 champion @entity4 has been searching for a new coach since @entity17 moved to @entity8 's former club @entity18 earlier this month . @entity8 has signed a three - year contract at the @entity20 and will be presented to the media on wednesday . former @entity23 captain @entity9 's arrival at @entity5 was announced at almost exactly the same time as @entity8 's appointment . " @entity5 is delighted to announce the appointment of @entity9 as coach for the next two years , " read a @entity5 statement .

@entity4 champions @placeholder kick off the new season against @entity6	@entity5	@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- the new @entity4 season kicked off on friday when defending champions @entity5 beat @entity6 2 - 0 at the @entity7 -- @entity8 details what to expect from the new campaign : so what 's new ? no less than eight teams underwent a change of coach during the off season with @entity17 's appointment of @entity18 the most high profile after the disappointing reign of @entity21 and @entity23 ' spell as caretaker boss . @entity25 has left champions @entity5 to help revive ailing @entity27 , who finished eighth last time round , with former @entity6 chief @entity29 moving into the hot seat . @entity32 playmaker @entity31 was the most significant player departure from the @entity4 after he swapped @entity34 for @entity36 giants @entity35 in a deal worth $ 35 million . @entity34 filled the void left by the influential midfielder with the $ 12 million signing of promising youngster @entity41 from @entity42 . striker @entity43 moved to @entity17 from @entity6 for a @entity4 record fee of $ 43 million while @entity5 increased their goal options with the capture of @entity47 forward @entity48 . one change in the structure of the @entity4 is the reduction of the winter break from six to three weeks to help ease fixture congestion and enable the national team longer to prepare for the @entity55 in @entity56 . . @entity57 is back at his former club @entity58 key players : speculation over the future of @entity17 star @entity63 - who has been linked with @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 - has been the main transfer topic that has filled column inches during the off season . if @entity63 remains with the club he could prove to the difference between @entity17 and the rest of the title contenders although the arrival of defensive midfielder @entity76 from @entity77 will add some much - needed steel to their midfield . @entity32 striker @entity81 notched 28 goals in 25 @entity4 matches last season and his form in the 2009/10 season could be key if @entity5 can hold onto their title . the battle for places in @entity91 's squad for the @entity55 could also have a knock - on effect on the fortunes of several @entity4 sides . who will win the @entity4 title ? sound off below . @entity98 pair @entity97 and @entity99 could well be vying for one place in @entity91 's squad , while @entity57 in particular will be keen to be make up for lost time with @entity58 following his emotional return to the club after a stop - start spell at @entity17 . @entity5 won their first @entity4 title last season key clubs : @entity110 enjoyed a creditable first @entity4 campaign and were top heading into the winter break before they faded in the second half of the season following a serious injury to leading striker @entity116 . if the @entity120 international can rediscover his touch , and new signings @entity122 and @entity124 settle in quickly , then @entity118 's men could again upset the established elite and this time stay in contention until the end of the season . @entity27 supporters will hope that new boss @entity25 can repeat the heroics he achieved with @entity5 last time round . the 56 - year - old steered the @entity133 to their first @entity4 title by improbably pipping @entity17 to the post , ending the season top of the division with a two point lead over the @entity139 giants at the top of the division after 34 games . elsewhere , if @entity57 can show the form he is capable of and finds the net regularly he may add the firepower @entity58 need to move from perennial relegation strugglers to @entity148 hopefuls . all eyes will be on new @entity17 coach @entity18 when the new season starts . expert view : @entity2 's @entity152 - " well as much as i hate to say it , @entity17 are the favorites to do the business this season . by their high standards , last season was a flop . " after similar disappointment in 2007 , they came back hard in 2008 and were little short of unstoppable . i would not expect anything different this time round . " to add to an already star - studded squad , they have made top - class signings in @entity43 , @entity76 and @entity167 . what 's more , they will be masterfully led by new coach @entity18 - who has the credentials and experience lacked by @entity21 . " nonetheless , the past few years have proved the @entity4 title is not necessarily a foregone conclusion , and there are a few other sides that can challenge the favorites . watch the predictions of @entity2 's @entity152 for the coming campaign » " @entity5 will be hoping for a repeat of last season 's glory . and after managing to hold on to strike duo @entity81 and @entity183 , they are bound to get enough goals to present a solid challenge although the distraction of the @entity187 could be their undoing . " @entity6 will also be looking to pick up where they left off and can not afford a slow start this time round . consistency will be the key if they are to turn into title challengers , although the departure of @entity43 to @entity17 will leave a huge void .

author @placeholder talks to @entity0 about his new thriller , " @entity6 "	@entity10	( @entity0 ) -- if you prefer your prose pulpy , hard - boiled as a country egg and darker than a midnight shade of noire , then you may be ready for some " @entity6 . " the new page - turner from modern pulp master @entity10 ( pronounced sweer - @entity8 - ski ) hits bookstores tuesday . @entity10 is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers , a regular contributor to @entity14 and has collaborated with @entity15 , the @entity16 mastermind behind tv 's " csi " on the series of best - selling , @entity21 26 " digi - novels . " his book reads like a @entity24 movie on speed , full of high - octane action , flying by at a breakneck pace , not for the faint of heart , but also with plenty of humor . " @entity6 " is the first book in a trilogy , about an unkillable ex-cop with a checkered past and a b - movie actress with a deadly secret . this pair of misfits is thrown together then hunted by a small army of mysterious hit men dubbed " the accident people . " while @entity10 hails from @entity45 , this book is set in @entity16 and takes advantage of a sunny locale loaded with shady people . the story starts with a white - knuckle car chase through the @entity51 , grabs readers by the scruff of the neck and refuses to let go for the next 304 pages . @entity0 talked to the author last week . the following is an edited transcript . @entity0 : what led you to start a trilogy ? @entity10 : " @entity6 " is about an alcoholic house sitter who , one sunny @entity63 morning , finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world . it 's kind of a blend of " @entity68 " and " @entity69 . " the only reason that it 's a trilogy is because i could n't quite kill off the house sitter , @entity73 , in one book . ( he dies in the opening pages of the sequel , " @entity77 . " ) ok , i 'm kidding about that . ( or am i ? hmmm ... ) when i originally pitched my editor , @entity79 , i had a one - shot thriller in mind , but he asked if there was a way to build it into a bigger story . that 's the sick genius of @entity79 ; whatever you 're thinking , he 's thinking bigger . it 's inspiring , in a demented sort of way . @entity0 : who are " the accident people " ? @entity10 : i love books and movies about hit men . it just strikes me as the ideal job -- you set your own hours , you bring your own gear , you accept only the work you want . when i thought about the perfect hit team , it occurred to me that maybe they would have had experience in a different , yet related , field . i do n't want to spoil anything , so i 'll stop there ... but there 's a specific reason these guys operate out of @entity111 @entity0 : your novels have been described as high octane , brutal and smart but also with a sense of humor , sound accurate ? @entity10 : whoever said that is very kind , and i owe them money . but that 's certainly the target i 'm aiming for . if someone closes one of my novels before finishing , i consider it a failure . so i 'm doing everything in my power to keep those pages turning -- even if i have to resort to fireworks and tap - dancing . @entity0 : what led to your website , " @entity135 ? " @entity10 : my love of noir and pulp grew right out of my teenage love of horror fiction ( which i still love ) . the best genre thrillers show people pushed to their extremes , and it 's fascinating to watch how characters deal with those extremes . @entity135 started as a way to share cool stuff with friends , then turned into a place where i can hang with readers and show them cool stuff . i do n't update it as often as i like ; @entity154 often robs me of my urge to blog . @entity0 : you 've also recently been involved in digi - novels and an e-story tie in to the " @entity160 " video game . will we see more of that ? @entity10 : absolutely . i 'll always be a sucker for new , shiny toys . i do n't want to write the same book endlessly and then die ; i 'd rather be known as the guy who tried as many different formats and subgenres as possible . even if some of those efforts are disasters . @entity0 : @entity45 features prominently in much of your writing , but " @entity6 " switches coasts . @entity10 : well , for better or worse , @entity45 is where my imagination goes to play . the more i travel , though , the more my imagination likes to hang out in other cities . this is how the @entity111 - set " @entity6 " came about ; the story just refused to take place anywhere else . @entity0 : what 's on your summer reading list ? @entity10 : such a great question , because i leave for a cross-country book tour / road trip in a few weeks , and i 've been obsessing about which books to pack . some of the definites : -- " @entity190 , " edited by @entity189 -- " @entity191 and the @entity192 , " by @entity193 -- " @entity194 , " by @entity195 -- " @entity196 , " by @entity197 -- " you 're next , " by @entity199 -- " @entity200 , " by @entity201 and @entity202 and a pile of comics and magazines and road atlases and travel guides . of course , the joy of being on the road is the opportunity to pick up more books from many fine idea shops across the country . i may have to ship my children home separately to make room for more books . @entity0 : what 's next ? @entity10 : my first issue of " @entity220 , " for @entity221 , will appear this september -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title ( all with new @entity225 issues ) . if you 're not familiar with the @entity220 , they 're an all - female covert ops team who operates out of @entity230 's @entity229 . ( i 'm giddy just typing that . ) october brings " @entity77 , " the sequel to " @entity6 . " and then in late december : " @entity235 , " my third @entity234 thriller with @entity15 . it 's been kind of a crazy year , now that i think about it ...	@entity21:Level	@entity24:Quentin Tarantino	@entity111:L.A.	@entity135:Secret Dead Blog	@entity154:Twitter	@entity230:Batman	@entity0:CNN	@entity6:Fun & Games	@entity199:Gregg Hurwitz	@entity235:Dark Revelations	@entity197:Jason Starr	@entity196:The Pack	@entity195:Megan Abbott	@entity194:The End of Everything	@entity193:Sara Gran	@entity192:City of the Dead	@entity191:Claire DeWitt	@entity190:The Big Book of Adventure Stories	@entity51:Hollywood Hills	@entity79:Schoenfelder	@entity77:Hell & Gone	@entity73:Charlie Hardie	@entity16:Hollywood	@entity15:Anthony E.

@placeholder beats @entity13 to reach third straight @entity3 semifinal	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's @entity1 has admitted she is desperate to win the @entity3 , a tournament where she has been beaten in the final on four different occasions . the third seed , who fell at the final hurdle in both 2011 and 2012 , made it through to the semifinals for the third year in a row after beating @entity13 of @entity14 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 . @entity1 's semifinal opponent will be @entity17 's @entity16 after the former world no. 1 beat @entity13 's compatriot @entity19 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 6 - 3 . @entity1 may have won four grand slams but following defeats in 2005 , 2006 , 2011 and 2012 , she would love to add a success in @entity23 to those triumphs . @entity26 's @entity25 is the defending champion , furthering the @entity2 's @entity3 misery last year to add to previous final failures against @entity29 ( 2011 ) , @entity30 ( 2006 ) and @entity31 ( 2005 ) . " i 've been so close to winning . i would love to win it , " @entity1 told reporters after seeing off the eighth seed . " i 've been coming to this tournament since i was a little kid . it would mean a lot to win it . " the world @entity38 had to work hard for victory against @entity13 , who she defeated in last year 's @entity42 to achieve her career grand slam , having previously won @entity44 ( 2004 ) , the @entity45 ( 2006 ) and the @entity46 ( 2008 ) . she may have won their previous three meetings but @entity1 was still forced to save three set points on her own serve in the second set before eventually prevailing . " i had a really difficult opponent , " added the @entity2 , who has won all four of her previous semifinals at the event . " she really made me work for this match . a few ups and downs in the match but i 'm really happy to get through . " the victory , which took two hours and 29 minutes to complete , was the second in successive tournaments for the @entity2 over @entity13 . the previous success came en route to winning the @entity65 title earlier this month , a tournament which pushed @entity1 one place up the world rankings . in the men 's draw , @entity70 's conqueror @entity69 moved into the last four with a convincing win against 11th seed @entity74 . @entity75 's @entity69 did not concede a break point to the @entity77 en route to a 6 - 3 6 - 1 victory . " i played some good points when it came down to it , which i am proud of , and then served out the first set . i felt pretty comfortable after that , " the 34 - year - old former world @entity38 told the tournament 's official website . " i used my chances right away in the second set and took that momentum . again , i played the way i wanted to , using my all - around game and variety . i think i did that pretty well tonight . " next up for @entity69 is third seed @entity95 , who came from one set down to defeat @entity97 's @entity96 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 0 . @entity98 's @entity95 will be hoping to reach the final of this event for the first time in his career , having been a semifinalist in 2005 and 2006 . he also has more match wins than any other player on the @entity106 this year , with wednesday 's win over @entity96 his 24th of 2013 . " i was a little bit nervous in the first set and part of the second , " said the 30 - year - old @entity95 . " but i tried to fight every point , to be focused and i had a good feeling in the final of the second set and of course in the third one .

@entity307 visited a privately run immigration detention center in @placeholder	@entity1	@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the little girl paused , then answered my questions : " i 'm 7 . " " second grade . " her hair was in braided pigtails . she wore a fancy dress . the girl had taken a seat in the folding chair next to mine after guards led another small group into the brightly lit room . we were in the post-security visitation area of the @entity20 , a privately run federal immigration facility in south @entity1 . behind us was a plain wall . in front were five sparse booths , open to the room , offering little privacy . each booth had a chair and a large black telephone . thick glass separated the booths from men who milled about on the other side . the men wore different colored jumpsuits : some blue , some orange , some red . like the older woman , an aunt perhaps , who accompanied her into the room , the little girl to my right was visibly nervous . this was her first trip to the detention center . i told the girl about my own second - grader in an effort to get her mind off our surroundings . i 'm quite certain i failed . after several minutes , a man in his late 20s sat down on the other side of the glass . he picked up a phone . the little girl walked up , studied another phone for a moment , and carefully raised it to the side of her head . her greeting was straightforward : " hi , @entity63 . " i could n't hear what her father said in reply . i could see his wistful smile , though , and tears rolling down his cheeks . * * every day , our immigration laws are breaking apart families of many citizens living in the @entity74 . it 's good news that , as a bipartisan group of @entity74 senators seeks consensus on a plan for comprehensive immigration reform , one focus is on so - called " family reunification " preferences in our law . the senators are debating whether , and to what extent , our immigration policies should give priority to admitting family members of immigrant citizens -- their spouses , children and siblings -- still living abroad . but while family reunification is an important consideration , that issue avoids the larger point dramatized at the @entity20 about the harmful impact of @entity74 immigration policy on families already here . more than 1.5 million unauthorized immigrants have been removed from the @entity74 since president @entity103 took office in 2009 , according to the federal government 's statistics . approximately 410,000 were removed last year alone . these numbers present an important question : who are the immigrants we are deporting ? yes , some are dangerous criminals who need to be arrested , prosecuted and removed through deportation . living in the @entity74 without legal status does not , however , amount to criminality . the @entity116 noted this last year when it wrote , " as a general rule , it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the @entity74 . " overstaying a visa , for example , is a civil violation and not a criminal one . the offenses that can trigger incarceration at detention centers like the one i visited recently include traffic violations such as driving without a valid license . this may seem like a matter of semantics to some , but incarcerating nonviolent immigrants carries real costs to the country and to the immigrants ' family members who are , in many cases , @entity74 citizens . many present - day immigrants live among us in what researchers call " mixed status " households . approximately 9 million people live in these modern @entity74 families that include both citizens and unauthorized immigrants . the result is that @entity74 - citizen family members are frequently left behind when immigrants are deported . contrary to popular belief , marriage to a @entity74 citizen does not automatically confer legal status on unauthorized immigrants . while marriage can provide a pathway to legal residency , that path is often long and can be overrun with bureaucratic pit stops . in many instances , our laws require immigrant spouses to return to their home countries and remain there for as long as 10 years before reunification is permitted . these extended bars to re-entry apply , for example , to @entity173 nationals who arrived in this country after 2001 without authorization even if they are married to a @entity74 citizen . in that way , our current immigration laws give some @entity74 citizens a distressing choice : either extended separation from their immediate families or extended separation from this country . an emerging bipartisan consensus acknowledges that our immigration laws are broken and need to be reformed , in a comprehensive way , at the federal level . as @entity189 tackles this issue , we should acknowledge that reform can benefit more than the immigrants living among us . it can benefit @entity74 children who attend school with our kids , @entity74 men who share pews at our churches , and @entity74 women sitting beside us in office cubicles , by keeping their families together . done right , immigration reform can strengthen our economy , uphold our values and preserve the family units of many @entity74 citizens . * * before entering the @entity20 , all visitors must fill out paperwork disclosing their immigration status . i did n't see the form of the little girl i met in the visitation room , of course , or ask the question as we chatted briefly . given her family 's willingness to bring her inside the barbed wire gates of the facility , however , it 's safe to assume that she is a native - born citizen . she 's as @entity74 as my grandfather , who grew up on @entity227 farmland in the early 1900s , and who spoke nothing but @entity230 at home until the start of @entity233 as my four children . the little girl was among many @entity74 citizens who visit family member inmates at the detention center . on the day of my visit , at the other end of the room , a woman in her 40s sat in the corner booth . she saved up gas money and drove more than 300 miles for this chance to have a one - hour visit with her husband . born and raised in western @entity249 , she lives on land that was owned by her father , and her father 's father before him . she met her husband in a thrift store in her hometown . they fell in love . in the visitation room , the woman held a phone and spoke to her husband in @entity262 with a country twang . what she wanted most that day was the chance to touch his hand , just for a moment , through the glass . that was a chance she did n't get . without changes to our federal immigration laws , more husbands and fathers , and wives and mothers , of @entity74 citizens will be deported . more @entity74 children will be raised outside the presence of a parent 's love and financial support . and more @entity74 -- like the woman i saw pressing the palm of her hand against cold glass in a detention center booth -- may not have the chance to touch their spouses again . at least not in our country . at least not anytime soon . the current immigration system does not make our nation , or our families , stronger . we can do better . we can reform our immigration laws in a way that brings hardworking people out of the shadows and keeps families together . that is , or at least should be , the @entity74 way . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity307 .	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:Georgia	@entity0:Atlanta	@entity307:Marquardt	@entity227:Missouri	@entity189:Washington	@entity20:Stewart Detention Center	@entity230:German	@entity233:World War I.

in the last year @placeholder tablets grew from 2 % in the global market to 27 %	@entity21	( @entity0 ) -- smaller tablet computers that are significantly more affordable and portable than the @entity2 are finally starting to hit the @entity3 -- and they could hit a crucial sweet spot in the consumer market . recently @entity7 announced the new @entity8 , which costs $ 200 . that 's the same price as @entity11 's recently announced @entity10 . the @entity8 starts shipping friday , while the @entity10 wo n't start shipping until november 15 . the @entity13 , which costs about $ 250 , is already available in stores and online . although marketed mainly as e-book readers , all three of these consumer devices are actually small tablet computers ( 7 inches ) that run the @entity21 mobile operating system and use @entity22 -- no carrier data plan or contract required . so theoretically , they can do much more than just let you buy and read e-books . this makes them potentially powerful tools for people who want access to the @entity33 , apps and more -- especially people who face economic or other barriers to using smartphones or computers . small , inexpensive , easy - to - use tablets could become an important bridge to help people cross the digital divide and gain expanded access to education , jobs , community , and other resources . the grand vision of tablet computers is that , ideally , they 'll allow the average , non-geeky person to do most of what can be done with a laptop computer -- in a way that 's much easier to learn , use and carry around . certainly this is the case with @entity57 's @entity2 , which sold 11 million units in the last quarter alone . but at this point , @entity2 start at $ 500 -- about what you might pay for a brand new 32 - inch flat - screen tv at @entity63 , and twice or more what pc netbooks cost at most retail stores . from the perspective of typical consumers , especially given the current economy , that 's a significant luxury investment . this month there are fresh rumors that @entity57 may be planning to introduce a smaller and less costly " ipad mini . " but nothing is confirmed , so do n't hold your breath . the tablet market is growing fast , and its dynamics are shifting quickly . according to a new report from @entity80 , in the last year @entity21 tablets grew from 2 % of the global tablet market to 27 % . meanwhile , the @entity2 's global tablet market share has dropped from 96 % to 67 % . that does n't reflect a decrease in the @entity2 's popularity , but rather that consumer demand for tablets is not one - size - fits - all . in fact , size is a key issue for people shopping for tablets . the @entity2 measures roughly 7 - by - 10 inches -- too big for a typical pocket or purse , and nearly twice the size of the basic @entity8 , @entity13 and @entity10 models . digital devices that are n't as easy to carry around tend to mainly get used only at certain times of day , in certain settings . for this reason it 's questionable how " mobile " larger tablets like the @entity2 really are . aside from the @entity105 , @entity10 , and @entity13 , there are lots of other small @entity21 tablets available . but so far these products have faced various challenges in the consumer market : cost : the @entity22 - only version of @entity113 's 7 - inch @entity112 costs about $ 350 , which is on the pricier side . the carrier - branded versions cost much less to buy up front if you agree to a two - year contract . for instance , @entity119 currently sells the 7 - inch @entity112 for just $ 200 , but data plans cost $ 30 - $ 80 per month , and there 's a $ 350 early termination fee . @entity124 , publisher of the @entity126 and @entity127 , is selling a small @entity21 tablet by @entity129 for just $ 99 - $ 129 in a small pilot program -- but for that bargain - basement price you have to agree to a one - or two - year newspaper subscription , costing up to $ 13 per month . device quality : this is an issue for the cheapest tablets . for instance , one reviewer noted that the touchscreen performance on the @entity140 tablet is less than stellar . in contrast , the @entity13 has been getting generally favorable reviews for device quality . the advance kindle fire reviews are also mostly positive . @entity21 's learning curve : this can be an obstacle for some . the straightforward @entity21 experience that comes with tablets by @entity113 , @entity151 , @entity152 , and other manufacturers can be daunting to typical consumers -- especially the majority of @entity3 consumers who do n't yet own a smartphone . a more constrained but dependable out - of - the - box user experience can be simpler to learn and can make the average consumer happier , at least initially . gadgets that are more complex or open - ended tend to confuse or frustrate average consumers -- which generally is n't good for sales . despite the high relative cost of @entity57 devices , and the fairly closed nature of the @entity57 ecosystem , there 's a lot to be said for " it just works . " however , most " pure " @entity21 tablets do offer one key advantage over constrained e-reader tablets : direct access to @entity174 's @entity173 , where there 's a virtually unlimited choice of apps . the @entity10 , @entity13 , and @entity140 tablets only offer apps through their own markets , not the @entity173 , which means they can block the installation of competing apps , such those from other e-book vendors or publishers . also , even though @entity7 touts that its @entity105 will offer access to " over 15,000 apps , " the company has not clarified whether that will be through the @entity173 or its own app store . which means it 's possible that you may not be able to install the @entity10 e-reader app on the @entity8 -- at least , not without " rooting " the tablet to remove vendor controls , which can be a formidable technical hurdle . the coming year -- especially the 2011 holiday season -- will probably indicate whether smaller tablets will play a leading role in the @entity3 digital media landscape . if these devices start becoming as commonplace as iphones and @entity204 , they may become popular and powerful tools for the delivery of mobile services for health , education , jobs , and more . sure , you can use a small , cheap tablet to read books , watch @entity214 , and play " @entity215 . " but maybe someday lots of people will be using these devices to get a college degree -- or perhaps to learn to read in the first place . the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity222 .	@entity22:Wi-Fi	@entity21:Android	@entity80:Strategy Analytics	@entity113:Samsung	@entity112:Galaxy Tab	@entity152:Lenovo	@entity151:Motorola	@entity119:Verizon	@entity3:U.S.	@entity2:iPad	@entity173:Android Market	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Kobo	@entity174:Google	@entity8:Kobo Vox	@entity57:Apple	@entity214:YouTube	@entity33:Web	@entity13:Nook Color	@entity11:Amazon	@entity10:Kindle	@entity105:Vox	@entity129:Arnova	@entity126:Philadelphia Inquirer	@entity127:Daily News	@entity124:Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.	@entity204:Kindles	@entity222:Amy Gahran	@entity140:Philly.com	@entity215:Angry Birds	@entity63:Best Buy

" warming up " does n't really capture it ; the dancers explode across the stage , each one with a different hip - hop style . @entity14 is chic - grungy in black jeans and white t - shirt , her long black hair swirling around her head . @entity19 , from @entity20 , tall and thin , does a kind of electric hip - hop mixed with salsa . @entity25 @entity24 and @entity26 move in a dramatic break dance . both hail from @entity25 , home of the tango . @entity31 from @entity32 , with a buzz cut and dressed in white jeans and a white t - shirt , has @entity37 bravado in his every move . the dancing stops and @entity40 begins rapping -- in @entity41 . no translation needed ; it comes from his soul . three weeks ago , the dancers had never met , but now they 're a team , participating in the @entity48 's @entity47 . the program consists of three weeks of meeting @entity51 hip - hop artists and dancers and visiting @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity0 " it 's like a dream come true for me , " @entity14 said tuesday , the day of the team 's show , " because i only read their names in the @entity62 and now , like , i met @entity63 , the founder of hip - hop . i was right next to him . it 's a real immersion into the culture . i do n't want to wake up ! " @entity14 is n't just star - struck . she 's learning a lot and she plans to bring it back to her fellow dancers in the @entity71 . " dancers in the @entity71 do n't have much of a foundation [ in hip - hop ] , " she says . " they do n't understand why dancers do this " -- she moves her arm -- " or why they do this " -- she strikes a pose . " because if they knew why they would feel it . i can feel it by watching these [ @entity51 ] hip - hop dancers . " @entity85 agrees : " you 've got to feel it . " his rapping , he says , comes from inside - out . " even if you do n't know the language , you can get involved with what i 'm saying . " @entity85 says that when he raps in his hometown of @entity96 in the @entity97 , he is " asking @entity91 to bring peace to our land . " @entity98 , the vibrant head of the @entity48 's @entity100 of the @entity101 , says the cultural cross-fertilization is the goal of the program . " there is nothing that can substitute for being in the @entity51 and meeting @entity51 in their place , to look at the richness and diversity of the @entity51 . that 's irreplaceable , " she says . the @entity47 is part of the @entity48 's cultural programming around the world . the $ 8.5 million budget is supplemented by institutions like the @entity7 , which is co-sponsoring this performance . most of the visiting artists in the program found their way to professional dance through hip - hop . @entity31 , a member of the @entity124 , is currently working to open a hip - hop training center in @entity126 to reach out to young people . with a broad smile , he says , " hip - hop is such energy . it 's so young . it 's also an opportunity for our countries to get closer , and i have a lot of friends all over the world . " hip - hop may have started in the @entity51 , but it belongs to everyone . here 's how @entity19 puts it : when he got to @entity53 , he felt as if he had landed on his " real planet .

police " very active " in seeking to link @placeholder also to 2012 killings , source says	@entity18	it was around 2:30 a.m. on june 17 when @entity1 climbed into a silver @entity2 . he had company . hours later , @entity1 was dead , shot with a .45 - caliber firearm and later found lying in a gravel pit in the southeastern @entity7 town of @entity8 . as of friday afternoon , the three others who had been in the car with @entity1 were in custody , authorities said . " we believe we have the three individuals ... and we 're very pleased about that , " @entity13 , @entity7 , district attorney @entity14 said . foremost among the suspects is @entity18 . he 'd been a star tight end with the @entity19 , at least until the team released him shortly after his arrest wednesday . the @entity13 , @entity23 , native pleaded not guilty this week to a premeditated murder charge , among others . " it is a circumstantial case . it is not a strong case , " his attorney , @entity27 , said this week in court . the cloud over @entity18 does n't end there . a law enforcement source told @entity35 that @entity37 police are " very active " -- and making progress -- in trying to connect the dots that could link @entity18 to an unsolved drive - by shooting that left two people dead last summer in @entity37 's @entity42 . in a related development , a silver sport utility vehicle owned by @entity18 that police believe is linked to that double homicide was impounded in @entity13 , a law enforcement source told @entity35 . the @entity48 reports that the unsolved shooting deaths of two men might have played a role in the motive for @entity1 's death . the newspaper quoted two law enforcement officials as saying @entity1 may have had information linking @entity18 to the shooting . " the motive might have been that the victim knew ( @entity18 ) might have been involved , " the paper said , quoting one of the officials , who asked for anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation . for now , prosecutors contend that something @entity1 may have done or said did n't sit well with the @entity68 standout . two days later , they allege , @entity18 rounded up some friends and orchestrated the hit , to settle the score . on wednesday , the same day authorities showed up at @entity18 's door and took him away in a police car , 27 - year - old @entity72 was similarly arrested in @entity13 and charged as a fugitive from justice . @entity72 was in a @entity7 court friday . according to his attorney , @entity79 , @entity72 pleaded not guilty to a single charge of carrying a firearm without a license . the charge was related to an incident that allegedly took place in @entity7 , though it was not immediately known if it had any connection with @entity1 's killing or the double homicide in 2012 . he 'll remain behind bars until a july 9 hearing at which time @entity79 said he plans to press a judge to set bail . " mr. @entity72 struck me as being a gentle person who is confused as to how he is in this situation , " @entity79 said following his first , brief meeting with his client friday afternoon . " ... we 're going to try and prove he 's not guilty . " meanwhile , @entity99 turned himself in friday in @entity100 , @entity101 , nearly 1,500 miles away . police there said @entity99 had seen news reports of an arrest warrant being issued for him out of @entity8 . @entity99 appeared before a judge in @entity107 , @entity101 , on saturday , and is charged with accessory after the fact of murder . @entity1 's last few hours prosecutors have alleged @entity1 's killing had something to do with a run - in between him and @entity18 over the weekend . the two met up at the popular @entity37 dance club , @entity115 , according to @entity1 's sister , @entity116 . who was @entity1 ? then , in the predawn hours of june 17 , @entity18 swung by in the rented @entity2 to pick up @entity1 -- a semipro football player who also worked as a landscaper and was dating the sister of @entity18 's fiancee -- at the latter 's @entity37 home , prosecutors say . they stopped at a gas station and bought things inside . one purchase may be a potentially key piece of evidence : a pack of blue bubblegum . prosecutors said that cell phone towers nearby tracked the men 's movements . @entity1 had his phone on and texted his sister at 3:23 a.m. , likely minutes before his death . " @entity68 . just so you know , " he texted his sister to let her know who he was with . about 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message -- gunshots shattered the quiet night , according to witnesses . guns and bubblegum not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera captured video of @entity18 carrying a gun as he arrived back at his home , prosecutors said . police return to @entity18 's home he was with two other people . @entity1 was not among them . a murder weapon is usually a key piece of evidence in a homicide case , and investigators have not been able to find one . @entity18 at least once had a @entity160 , prosecutors said , entering a cell phone photo into evidence of him posing in the mirror with it . and police have seized .45 - caliber ammunition and an ammunition magazine that were in a @entity169 he drove and a condo he rented . @entity18 and the other two later took the car back to the rental company . there , the defendant offered an attendant a piece of blue @entity179 gum , prosecutors said . what appeared to be a piece of chewed blue gum was left lying inside the vehicle , prosecutors said . next to it was a spent .45 - caliber casing . the casing matches the empty shells @entity189 recovered near @entity1 's body , prosecutors said . if that gum was in @entity18 's mouth , dna tests will connect him to the casings , prosecutors said . when investigators inspected @entity1 's body , they found keys in his pockets to a rental car registered in @entity18 's name . opinion : @entity68 does n't have answers on @entity18 a fallen star @entity18 had been expected to be one of the keys to the @entity19 ' stellar offense , a vital cog on a team that many expected could contend for a @entity211 title . now he 's sitting in a @entity7 jail cell . his stoic expression in videos after his arrest , including when he was in court , gave little indication of angst , sorrow or inner turmoil . yet the fact he 's behind bars , charged with such a heinous crime , has shaken many in @entity19 . his former team said firing @entity18 was " simply the right thing to do . " on friday , the team took another step in cutting its ties to the former @entity231 star , and letting fans do the same . having already taken his no. 81 off the shelves , the team announced people who had already bought such a jersey could exchange it for free for another player 's at the @entity238 the weekend of july 6 and 7 . " we know that children love wearing their @entity19 jerseys , but may not understand why parents do n't want them wearing their @entity18 jerseys anymore , " team spokesman @entity239 said .

@placeholder editor says , " no one is a victim in the celebrity world "	@entity179	( @entity0 ) -- get four successful women together on a movie set and you 'd think it 's all claws , all the time . some rumors would insinuate that " @entity9 's " @entity8 does n't get along with her co-star @entity10 , while another would allege there were catfights on the set of the sequel , as the stars revealed in the june issue of @entity18 . last week there was a similar tiff making headlines , although the spat seemed to be a bit one - sided . in an interview with @entity26 , pop star @entity24 referred to fellow superstar @entity27 as a " newcomer " who was " fun to look at , " but @entity24 posted a statement on her website claiming that there was n't any malice behind those words . " it is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women , " @entity24 said in the statement . " so i would like to tell you all directly so my words can not be misconstrued to sell someone else 's story . ... i have absolutely nothing against @entity27 or any other female artist in this business . " as @entity24 noted in her statement , this is n't the first time she 's " been unfairly pitted against another female artist . " if @entity24 or the " @entity9 " stars really are estranged from other famous women , so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars @entity57 or @entity59 ? for that matter , where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set ? " there are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting , " said celebrity blogger @entity65 , who runs @entity66 . " even when @entity71 got into that car accident while on a date with @entity74 -- even though she was dating @entity75 at the time -- nothing happened . @entity75 said they were n't serious , and the story was dropped . " obviously , this does n't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 or @entity89 and @entity91 - @entity90 the difference , said @entity93 , director of the @entity94 for @entity95 and @entity96 at @entity97 , is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones , and they 're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have . or , @entity103 said , the " celebrity men in conflict " angle will be given a different spin . " instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue , different work ethics will most likely be cited , " she said . " for example , when @entity114 and @entity115 filmed ' @entity116 ' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they were n't shooting . so it was understood why they were n't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were ' in character . ' if two women did that , it would be pitched as a cover - up for a more deep [ ly ] rooted reason . " the actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft - dirty business . " the chemistry among the four of us is very strong , [ but ] ... the press has to put women in these boxes , rather than show them as the movie portrays them : working together and being powerful , " @entity8 said in the @entity18 interview . " things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people 's imaginations . " a likely reason for the media coverage , explained pop culture expert and " @entity151 " author @entity150 , is because " it 's much easier to believe that women do n't like each other . it 's one of the few bastions of sexism that 's left in our culture , and we ca n't imagine that powerful , successful women could ever get along . " it all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with , @entity93 said . " one theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are . ... anyone who 's been in a workplace knows that it 's not an inherently gender - specific sort of thing , " @entity93 said . but " with the gender norms that we 've all grown up with , men manifest their ' cattiness ' differently than women ; we 're ok with the idea that women are emotional , and we expect them to be . " but said @entity178 , senior editor of celebrity magazine @entity179 , you ca n't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that 's to sell albums and rack up box - office numbers . " obviously , this is a competition , " @entity178 said . " people need to be responsible for their own actions -- [ @entity24 ] did say those words , and she said those things for a reason . @entity27 , for example , never says anything negative about anybody . " if these stars would n't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions , @entity178 said , the media would n't start yelling fire . " no one is a victim in the celebrity world , " he added . " very few of those rumors end up not being true . " regardless of whether they 're true or not , @entity103 said she 's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one are n't likely to let up anytime soon . " the question is n't why are these stories about women catfights being created , " she said . " unfortunately , the question is why not ? people enjoy the drama , and drama and divalike behavior sells .

this fall , @entity7 will launch @placeholder 8 , a radical redesign from the @entity6 of old	@entity6	( @entity0 ) -- i 've been a @entity2 user for about 11 years . and since i made the switch , i never thought the day would come when i 'd say this : i 'm excited for the next version of @entity6 . this fall , @entity7 will launch @entity6 8 , a radical redesign from the @entity6 you 've grown accustomed to since @entity10 made its debut 17 years ago . windows 8 has been reimagined from the ground up , and it 's built to run on both the traditional desktop and touchscreen tablets . at first glance , you 'll notice the classic start menu is gone , replaced by a gorgeous tile layout full of your favorite apps and files . @entity7 calls this the " @entity22 " interface . imagine it as a blown - up version of the @entity26 interface used on several smartphones now . those little tiles provide live updates with news , sports , weather , @entity28 mentions and @entity34 updates without you even having to open the app. in one quick glance , you can get all the information you need . it 's not the same old @entity6 . and that 's what makes me so excited to try the final version of @entity43 this fall . in a very un-microsoft move , the company created the most radical redesign of the desktop in well over a decade . it 's incredibly functional , too . a beta version @entity43 is available as a free consumer preview , and i 've been using it for the last few weeks . right now , there are only a handful of prototype tablets that run @entity6 8 , so i 've been using it on a laptop instead . however , since the @entity22 interface is designed more for touch than a mouse cursor , there 's a bit of a learning curve with @entity43 . scrolling through the @entity64 screen can get confusing on a keyboard until you learn all the shortcuts . but once you do , the experience is incredible , unlike any operating system i 've ever used . it 's the perfect hybrid of old and new . while @entity71 attempts slowly to merge its mobile operating system into the desktop with new @entity75 - like features , @entity7 made a bold move and jumped ahead to the future where most computing takes place on touch - friendly smartphones and tablets . it 's enough to make an @entity71 fan like me drool . but what if you 're worried you wo n't be able to catch on to the new look in @entity43 ? the classic @entity6 is still there in @entity43 . @entity7 hid it behind the @entity22 interface . that means you get the same old taskbar , start menu and desktop full of icons for your favorite apps . it 's a great way to ease the transition . plus , some apps such as @entity100 and @entity101 just work better on the classic desktop . of course , it 's far too early to tell if @entity7 's gamble with @entity43 will pay off . consumers have been slow to adopt @entity106 , and @entity43 is essentially just a blown - up version of that . but if @entity7 can get me this pumped up over a new product , then it must be doing something right . copyright © 2011 @entity112 .	@entity22:Metro	@entity2:Mac	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Microsoft	@entity6:Windows	@entity10:Windows 95	@entity28:Twitter	@entity100:Excel	@entity101:Powerpoint	@entity112:Business Insider	@entity106:Windows Phones	@entity43:Windows 8	@entity75:iPhone	@entity26:Windows Phone 7	@entity64:Start	@entity125:un-Microsoft	@entity71:Apple	@entity34:Facebook

@entity2 commanded @entity54 and @entity55 forces in @placeholder	@entity56	@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- gen. @entity2 lost his job when @entity5 magazine ran an article in which some of his aides made disparaging remarks about the vice president and others . but a newly released investigation by the @entity13 inspector general finds neither @entity2 nor any of his aides did anything wrong . in the article called " @entity17 " reporter @entity15 wrote that one of @entity2 's aides referred to vice president @entity20 as " @entity21 " and another referred to then - national security adviser gen. @entity22 as a " clown . " after interviewing 15 people , the inspector general 's office completed its report on april 8 . it was made public monday after a @entity31 request by the @entity32 . neither @entity2 , who cooperated with an earlier @entity34 investigation , nor @entity15 were interviewed for the inspector general 's report . in the report , the inspector general writes , " the evidence was insufficient to substantiate a violation of applicable @entity13 standards . " the report goes on to say , " not all of the events at issue occurred as reported in the article . " it concluded " none of the matters we reviewed warrant further investigation . " @entity2 , who had been in charge of all @entity54 and @entity55 units in @entity56 , was brought back to @entity0 after the article was published . after meeting with president @entity58 , he resigned his command and later retired from the military . but four days after the inspector general 's report was completed , the @entity61 announced @entity2 would be part of the @entity64 's and @entity66 's new @entity65 . the organization is set up to support and honor @entity54 's service members and their families . @entity2 is now a senior fellow at @entity70 .	@entity22:James Jones	@entity17:The Runaway General	@entity20:Joseph Biden	@entity21:Bite Me	@entity2:McChrystal	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Washington	@entity5:Rolling Stone	@entity56:Afghanistan	@entity55:ISAF	@entity54:U.S.	@entity58:Barack Obama	@entity70:Yale University	@entity31:Freedom of Information Act	@entity15:Hastings	@entity32:New York Times	@entity13:DoD	@entity34:Army	@entity66:Jill Biden	@entity64:Michelle Obama	@entity65:Joining Forces initiative	@entity61:White House
@entity4 's @entity1 hacked , info published after @entity10 fight with @placeholder	@entity9	( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 loves a good fight . but the @entity4 president may have second thoughts about mixing it up with members of the hacker collective @entity9 on thursday night on @entity10 , where he was on the receiving end of a brutal punch . @entity1 's personal information , including his social security number , cellphone number and address , was published online just moments after the exchange , in which he defended his company 's support of the controversial -- and now - shelved -- @entity23 . the @entity4 's website was also hacked for the second time in a week . the mixed - martial - arts promoter 's parent company was a supporter of @entity23 , which was intended to crack down on digital piracy . the company , @entity29 , says many of its fights are posted illegally online , either for free or with the pirate sites selling advertising on them . the back - and - forth kicked off shortly after 9 p.m. when one of the more popular @entity10 accounts associated with @entity9 called out @entity1 -- an avid @entity10 user -- for comments he made in a recent interview . after @entity4 's site was briefly hacked last weekend ( traffic was redirected to a site associated with @entity9 ) @entity1 called the @entity42 " a place where cowards live " and compared hackers to terrorists . " the way this whole thing has gone down , them hacking our site is the best thing they ever could have done for us . because what that does is , now , you look like terrorists and now a lot of people who were afraid of you now hate you , " @entity1 told @entity54 of @entity55 . " is this bill perfect ? @entity64 bill is perfect . i think this thing started off with the right idea . stealing is stealing ... . it 's not right and there 's something that needs to be worked out . " he wrapped up with a @entity4 - style challenge . " i 'm not afraid of you , " @entity1 said . " you do n't scare me . do it again . i do n't care . " of course , they did . " ahoy @ danawhite - what do you have against the @entity42 ? we 're just curious , as we were quite surprised at the harsh tone of your comments , " wrote the people behind the @entity10 feed @ @entity82 . @entity1 responded : " i love the @entity42 . it helped us grow our biz . stealing is stealing ! and hacking into people 's s --- is terrorism . " what followed was a sometimes profane back and forth with @entity1 defending his company 's stance and @entity9 members or sympathizers either lobbing attacks or defending their own group 's efforts , which have included attacking @entity101 drug cartels and oppressive governments . " if you guys want to change the world good for you ! " @entity1 wrote . " just do n't steal my s --- . " he argued that his fighters suffer financially when @entity4 money is siphoned away and cited the company 's own " outsider " pedigree , noting that mixed martial arts were banned in many states before gaining widespread recognition . between live bouts , pay - per - view sales , video games and other products , the @entity4 is now a billion - dollar industry . for a brief moment thursday , it looked like everyone would walk away happy . " why do n't you read thru our dialogue with him . it was actually quite pleasant and civil ... no s --- talking that we can see ! " the @entity82 account tweeted to another @entity10 user . but minutes later , someone posted a document on the site @entity134 showing what appears to be @entity1 's @entity137 number , cellphone number , address , legal cases and other information -- including his wife 's name . ( a later , edited version removed family information ) . the @entity4 site also was hacked again , with @entity9 logos briefly appearing on its main page . @entity1 did not mention either hack on his @entity10 feed friday morning , having moved on to promoting a fight card set for saturday night . @entity9 , of course , was n't so quiet .

a new @placeholder report documents what is described as repression in @entity2	@entity1	( @entity0 ) -- while the world 's attention has been focused on tumult in the @entity7 world , @entity2 has cracked down with impunity on dissent and is feared to come down even harder as elections approach , @entity1 said in a sweeping report . the global human rights monitor documented " widespread and persistent human rights violations in @entity2 . " " it is essential if further mass human rights violations are to be avoided that the international community act on behalf of the hundreds , if not thousands , of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners imprisoned after unfair trials in @entity2 , " @entity1 said in the report . supreme leader ayatollah @entity23 celebrated the popular revolts in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , saying that they reflected an " @entity30 awakening " based on @entity2 's 1979 revolution . but since the 2009 election , the @entity30 republic has repressed similar voices within its own borders , @entity1 said . " since the 2009 crackdown , the authorities have steadily cranked up repression in law and practice , and tightened their grip on the media , " according to the @entity1 report , which came out just hours after the @entity45 @entity44 convened for its latest session in @entity47 . " in @entity2 today , you put yourself at risk if you do anything that might fall outside the increasingly narrow confines of what the authorities deem socially or politically acceptable , " said @entity48 , of @entity1 's @entity49 and @entity51 program . " anything from setting up a social group on the @entity60 , forming or joining an @entity61 or expressing your opposition to the status quo can land you in prison , " she said . @entity2 has defended its record before the @entity45 @entity44 and charged that @entity67 critics are politicizing the issue of human rights for their own gain . yet @entity1 said @entity2 has deemed demonstrations , public debate and the formation of groups and associations a threat to " national security " punishable by long prison sentences or even death . " lawyers have been jailed along with their clients . foreign satellite television channels have been jammed . newspapers have been banned , " the advocacy group said . @entity85 , wife of detained journalist @entity86 , describes in the report how an interrogator told her husband , " we are ordered to crush you . and if you do not cooperate , we can do anything we want with you . and if you do not write the interrogation papers , we will force you to eat them . " @entity1 said blogger @entity96 was this month sentenced to four and a half years in prison followed by 10 years in " internal exile , " plus sentenced to pay a fine on charges believed to include " spreading propaganda against the system , " " gathering and colluding against national security " and " insulting officials . " @entity1 called on the world to pressure @entity2 to amend laws that restrict rights of expression and assembly , as well as to allow for public debate before @entity2 cast their votes in march . it also called for an end to jail time for people who protest peacefully and independent investigations of alleged human rights violations . the issue of human rights , said @entity1 , can get lost as the international community scrutinizes @entity2 's nuclear program . " for @entity2 facing this level of repression , it can be dispiriting that discussions about their country in diplomatic circles can seem to focus mainly on the nuclear program at the expense of human rights , " @entity122 said .	@entity23:Ali Khameini	@entity26:Egypt	@entity27:Bahrain	@entity25:Tunisia	@entity85:Mahdieh Mohammadi Gorgani	@entity86:Ahmad Zeidabadi	@entity2:Iran	@entity1:Amnesty	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Arab	@entity51:North Africa	@entity30:Islamic	@entity96:Mehdi Khazali	@entity122:Harrison	@entity44:Human Rights Council	@entity45:United Nations	@entity47:Geneva	@entity67:Western	@entity48:Ann Harrison	@entity49:Middle East	@entity60:Internet	@entity61:NGO

new : ex-dolphins player says @placeholder would test his teammates	@entity2	( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 have suspended pro bowler @entity2 after allegations of misconduct lodged by linemate @entity5 , who left the @entity7 team last week in the middle of the season . @entity1 head coach @entity10 told reporters monday he made the decision the previous night to suspend @entity2 " based on the information that i had at that time . " he did n't give a reason for the move . @entity16 , @entity7 and other media outlets reported that representatives for @entity5 submitted voicemails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence to the league and the @entity1 . one of the messages , from april , contained a reference to @entity5 's biracial background , according to @entity16 's sources . " hey , wassup , you half ( expletive ) piece of ( expletive ) . " i saw you on @entity31 , you been training 10 weeks . i 'll ( expletive ) in your ( expletive ) mouth . i 'm gon na slap your ( expletive ) mouth , i 'm gon na slap your real mother across the face ( laughter ) . ( @entity37 ) you , you 're still a rookie . i 'll kill you . " the team said sunday in a statement that @entity2 , a nine - year veteran at offensive guard , was suspended for detrimental conduct . " we believe in maintaining a culture of respect for one another and as a result we believe this decision is in the best interest of the organization at this time , " the team said in a statement on its website . the @entity52 reported that a @entity1 official said @entity2 is " done " with the team . a @entity1 spokesman had no comment . cafeteria incident sparked departure last week , the @entity1 announced @entity5 had taken " a leave of absence . " @entity10 said @entity5 left the team after an incident at the team 's cafeteria . @entity64 , an @entity7 analyst for @entity65 , reported that some of his teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when @entity5 sat down . the lineman threw his food tray hard to the ground , he reported . @entity64 later tweeted the incident was a final straw for @entity5 . the coach said representatives for @entity5 contacted the team sunday with their concerns . the @entity1 spent sunday gathering information , after which he suspended @entity2 , @entity10 said . several media outlets said @entity5 had left the @entity1 because of bullying , something @entity2 denied on @entity31 . " shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation , " one of the tweets said , according to @entity85 . that tweet and others addressed to various media outlets were deleted later . a post from sunday remained a day later : " three things can not be long hidden : the sun , the moon , and the truth -- @entity97 . " @entity10 said he met with @entity5 and also talked with members of his family before sunday , and the second - year player did n't say anything about player misconduct . @entity0 reached out multiple times to representatives for each player but has n't received comment . ' @entity107 off the field ' @entity109 played with @entity2 when both were with the @entity111 in 2007 and 2008 . @entity2 's onfield aggressive persona was nothing like his personality away from the playing field , @entity109 said . " he was really kind of a big teddy bear off the field . my wife actually loved him , " he told @entity0 . the @entity121 takes a yearly poll of @entity7 players , and in 2009 they dubbed @entity2 the dirtiest player in the league . the @entity111 released @entity2 in december 2009 after an argument during a game with then - head coach @entity128 . he played with the @entity129 for three games before joining the @entity1 . @entity2 , who played in the @entity132 all - star game in january , appeared to have calmed down on the field , according to a profile on @entity7 . @entity2 pointed to meditation as a positive tool he used . the @entity7 will review the case , league spokesman @entity137 said monday . " i will tell you that if the review shows that this is not a safe atmosphere i will take whatever measures are necessary to assure that it is , " @entity10 said . " i have that obligation to the players that i coach on a daily basis . " the @entity147 has said the union has not started an investigation . @entity7 's pecking order rookie @entity151 said he has n't experienced any acts of bullying or hazing . " i think a lot of people think of hazing as being cruel , but i do n't see anything like that in this locker room , " he said . " but it depends on how you take hazing . i 've always thought the guys in here were great . " he said everyone on the team loves @entity2 . " i was shocked , " he said . wide receiver @entity166 said there was a lot of respect for both players . " i know both of those guys personally , " he said . " i feel like they are both good guys . " former dolphins linebacker @entity174 told " @entity179 " that a locker room is often a place where players are trying to establish a pecking order . people can not compare it to working at a regular job , he said , because we are talking about physically aggressive men with big egos competing and trying to prove their manhood . @entity7 players are " a bunch of testosterone - filled alpha males who are trying to find their place on the totem pole , " he told @entity0 . he said when @entity2 joined the team , he would test people to see where he stood with them . " he is a guy that needs to know his place with you , " @entity174 said . @entity2 also apparently liked to play pranks . in a segment shown on a @entity199 series that follows one @entity7 team during each preseason , @entity2 figured out a teammate 's @entity203 password . he then teased the player about a status update he made for the player and joked about the player 's fiancee . " @entity217 " has given audiences a look inside team dynamics , sometimes giving viewers a glimpse at life for rookies . and inevitably some of the younger players get hazed . hazing on the decline ? still , former @entity1 running back @entity220 said it occurs less frequently in the @entity7 than most people think . " really i have n't see much hazing , " he said in an interview on " the lead with @entity224 . " he said its a well - known " rite of passage " for a high draft pick to pick up a big dinner bill for some other players on the team . " once you sign that contract there 's a lot of rules , written and unwritten , that you are expected to follow , " he said . " for me , this is something that should be handled internally . i do n't think the media , i do n't think fans , i do n't think anyone outside is really in a position to really fully understand what occurs inside of a locker room and inside of a football team .

" this is one of those moments where you know you need to be enjoying it as it 's happening , but that 's also hard to do because it 's moving so fast . " -- about what he hopes his 3Â½ - year - old daughter @entity99 , who accompanied her father to @entity0 and knows only that " @entity101 is giving a big speech , " takes away from tonight when she reads press clippings years from now : " what i hope is that one day when she watches it that she understands that her family came here and sacrificed and worked hard to achieve the @entity67 , " he said . " and that this was the moment , the pinnacle of it . and i hope that she 's very proud . and i also hope , like any dad , that she goes further than i did .

" this is the wonderful progress that the country has achieved not just for them but for so many @entity40 , that @entity40 has lived up to its highest ideals and our family is one example of that . " -- lastly , about the reaction he 's getting from the large contingent of @entity145 - language media that is covering the convention , whose audience is more @entity147 than @entity148 , more immigrant than native - born : " the interviews are always very warm , " he said .

" there is little chance of that . the @entity55 do n't let people down ; they lift people up . get ready , @entity40 . a new generation offers a leader . and a population of people who helped build this remarkable country , and who have repeatedly answered the call to defend it , have finally come into their own . we @entity147 - @entity40 are known for our humility . but is there pride in that ? you had better believe it . join us on @entity179 / @entity178 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182	@entity27:Joaquin	@entity15:DNC	@entity119:Rosie	@entity3:Castro	@entity2:CNN	@entity1:North Carolina	@entity0:Charlotte	@entity6:San Antonio	@entity179:Facebook	@entity178:CNNOpinion	@entity9:Texas	@entity55:Castros	@entity31:Harvard Law School	@entity30:Stanford University	@entity33:Preview Castro	@entity13:Latino	@entity10:Southwest	@entity101:Daddy	@entity99:Carina	@entity124:Republicans	@entity123:Democrats	@entity121:Raza Unida Party	@entity145:Spanish	@entity147:Mexican	@entity182:Navarrette	@entity148:Mexican-American	@entity187:Latinos	@entity46:Obama	@entity40:Americans	@entity67:American Dream	@entity48:Mitt Romney
@entity11 was found near the remains of two women linked to @placeholder	@entity7	( @entity0 ) -- the remains of an @entity3 teenager missing for more than 25 years were recently identified by authorities , and police are looking into whether she might have been a victim of @entity7 , known as the " @entity7 . " police believe @entity7 could be responsible for the death of @entity11 because her body was found within a mile of the remains of two other women that @entity7 admitted killing , the county sheriff 's office said . those bodies were found in @entity17 , @entity3 , near @entity18 . the bodies of @entity7 's other 46 victims were found in the @entity22 , @entity17 , area . the most prolific known serial killer in @entity25 history , @entity7 is serving 48 consecutive life sentences . he has denied involvement in @entity11 's death , as well as that of @entity30 , whose remains were found near @entity32 's . @entity11 was 16 when she was reported missing by her parents in may 1983 , authorities said . she was a straight - a student at her @entity36 " until she met the wrong people , " they said . @entity11 rode a bus from her home in @entity18 to @entity41 to school , and her parents believe she met people on the bus line " who turned her life upside down with drugs and eventually prostitution . " the last time @entity11 's parents heard from her was in july 1983 , police said : " she called and told her mother that she was ok , but did not say where she was at that time . " @entity11 was killed sometime between that phone call and early 1985 . her skeletal remains were found april 22 , 1985 , in a wooded area of @entity56 , @entity3 . it was one of two bodies found by people walking in the area . the bodies , however , were unidentified for years . " both bodies were badly decomposed and there were only traces of clothing discovered with them , " the sheriff 's statement said . the other body was identified in 1998 as being that of @entity30 , who was last seen in june 1983 working as a prostitute in the @entity22 area . she was reported missing by her family in march 1988 , and her body was identified using dental records . in june 1985 , two months after the remains of @entity11 and @entity30 were found , two other sets of skeletal remains were found within a mile of where theirs were . " detectives recognized the similarities with the @entity22 area 's @entity86 killings that were predominant in the news at the time , " the sheriff 's statement said . they contacted the @entity86 @entity90 at the @entity91 , @entity17 , @entity92 , and the bodies were eventually identified as those of @entity95 and @entity96 . both women were known @entity22 prostitutes , authorities said , and both had been reported missing . @entity11 's remains were sent to the @entity101 , which sent them to the @entity103 in @entity22 for possible identification . @entity91 could not identify the remains , so they were sent back to @entity3 . " unfortunately , somewhere in the transfer process they were misplaced , " the @entity106 said . " earlier this year , @entity11 's remains resurfaced at the @entity110 [ @entity3 ] @entity103 . " after realizing the bones did not belong to a @entity110 case , authorities sent them back to the state medical examiner , who notified @entity17 of the unidentified bones . @entity118 's detectives asked the medical examiner 's office to compare the remains once again with dental records of missing people in the area . " based on the investigation conducted over the years , @entity11 's remains were compared to the dental records her dentist had submitted in 1985 , " in october , authorities said . " they matched . " @entity7 , now 60 , was arrested in 2001 in @entity91 for the murders of five women . he later admitted he was the " @entity7 " and pleaded guilty to murdering 48 women , including @entity95 and @entity132 . " @entity7 claimed that he killed [ @entity95 and @entity132 ] in @entity91 and later transported the bodies to @entity3 , " @entity17 authorities said . " @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity30 were all reported missing from the @entity22 area . @entity11 was reported missing from the @entity18 area , and detectives have not received any information that she was in the @entity22 area prior to her death . " but , the statement said , " because of the close proximity of @entity30 's and @entity11 's remains to the remains of @entity95 and @entity96 , the locations where their bodies were disposed of and the time frame for the murders , detectives believe that @entity7 is responsible for their deaths . " @entity7 's plea agreement in @entity151 would not preclude his prosecution in @entity3 , @entity17 sheriff 's sgt. @entity149 told @entity0 . although @entity7 has denied responsibility , detectives are reviewing the cases and re-examining evidence collected over the years , police said . anyone with information about either @entity11 or @entity30 during 1983 , 1984 and 1985 is asked to contact the @entity106 . the @entity86 case takes its name from a river south of @entity22 where @entity7 began dumping his victims in 1982 . most of the women were prostitutes . @entity7 has said he targeted prostitutes " because i thought i could kill as many as i wanted without getting caught . " he said he killed because he hated prostitutes and did n't want to pay them for sex , and claimed he killed so many women he had a hard time keeping them straight .	@entity22:Seattle	@entity25:U.S.	@entity86:Green River	@entity110:Clackamas County	@entity151:Washington state	@entity132:Bush	@entity3:Oregon	@entity170:Teenager	@entity0:CNN	@entity7:Green River Killer	@entity56:Tualatin	@entity118:Sheriff	@entity17:Washington County	@entity30:Liles	@entity32:Girdner	@entity11:Girdner	@entity36:Catholic high school	@entity18:Portland	@entity101:Oregon State Medical Examiner 's Office	@entity103:Medical Examiner 's Office	@entity106:Washington County Sheriff 's Office	@entity96:Denise	@entity95:Shirley	@entity92:Sheriff 's Office	@entity91:King County	@entity90:Task Force	@entity149:David Thompson	@entity41:Beaverton

" @entity2 63 has chosen @entity9 to be our new coach , " a statement confirming the appointment read . " this appointment will allow @entity2 63 to begin a new era , relying on a group of 17 players currently under contract , which will be added by young players from the club . " the @entity42 will succeed @entity43 , who is currently in charge of @entity45 but is leaving at the end of the season when his contract expires . @entity49 , a sports science graduate , has been rewarded following her work with the @entity13 and @entity54 women 's national teams , while she also led @entity56 's male youth team to two @entity58 titles . she also spent time as a scout with @entity61 club @entity60 . currently 14th in @entity62 , clermontwill introduce @entity49 to the @entity3 media after the season 's final set of fixtures . male chauvinism while @entity49 is the first ever female coach in @entity3 professional football , @entity68 previously served as an assistant referee in @entity3 , also featuring in @entity73 games . the @entity74 boasts two high - profile females , with @entity76 fulfilling the role of @entity79 's first - team doctor , while @entity80 is @entity81 's vice chairman . former @entity29 women 's national team manager @entity82 was linked with the @entity85 job in 2009 , although she denied that she was ever in the running for the post . in @entity30 , @entity88 took charge of @entity30 @entity92 team @entity90 for two matches in 1999 . @entity94 , meanwhile , is currently the director of the @entity27 national team , however , she is responsible for marketing issues rather than sporting ones . historically women working in the football industry have had to contend with male chauvinism . @entity101 and @entity102 were household names on @entity106 broadcaster @entity104 -- two men who presented football to @entity106 viewers for so long they had become an integral part of the game itself . but both were forced to leave the broadcaster in 2011 shortly after they were caught making derogatory remarks about female match official @entity114 . talking near a microphone they thought had been turned off , @entity102 said : " can you believe that ? a female linesman . women do n't know the offside rule .

@entity33 @entity65 at @entity22 is home race for @entity20 and @placeholder	@entity19	editor 's note : @entity2 is the associate editor of @entity3 . he is also an @entity4 pundit for @entity7 's @entity6 show and writes blogs for @entity9 . ( @entity3 ) -- @entity10 called it people power , others just call it home advantage . @entity14 at @entity15 , @entity16 at @entity17 and -- this weekend -- @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 at @entity22 : they have the crowd behind them , they can hear the cheers from the stands , see the caps , banners and flags bearing their names . @entity10 was so popular with ( most of ) the @entity33 public that he even started his own movement , " @entity35 , " which peaked at @entity22 in 1987 . " @entity37 " -- never one to let an ailment or problem go unnoticed -- was suffering from a severe wheel vibration by lap 12 . ' last dinosaur ' or @entity4 's brainiest man ? it only got worse and soon he was running five seconds behind teammate @entity44 . the @entity46 team was n't planning to do any pit stops , but @entity10 dived in to change the offending wheel . he emerged 29 seconds off the lead . the fans were distraught -- there would n't be a repeat performance of @entity10 's win the year before at @entity53 -- but he was suddenly flying . " i think i broke the lap record 11 times in the last 15 laps , " he said at the time . he was soon up on the back of @entity44 and sold a dummy that @entity59 would have been proud of with only two laps to go . tires take center stage in @entity4 his second -- of four -- @entity33 @entity65 wins was complete . the crowd went mad and surged onto the track , so @entity10 had to come to a grinding halt on his slowing down lap to avoid running any of them over . @entity10 always believed the fans gave him extra power , that extra quarter of a second a lap. it may seem ridiculous , but four of his 31 @entity4 wins came on home turf in front of one of the most passionate crowds in the world . okay , not much comes close to the tifosi at @entity84 , bedecked in @entity85 , but @entity22 is up there . of course , not everyone shares the same view . @entity33 motorbike rider @entity88 looked a little bemused when posed the question of whether the fans gave him " extra power " ahead of his @entity65 race at @entity22 on june 17 this year . " i do n't know ... what ? like @entity93 with his spoon ? if he really thinks about it , it bends ... " he said smiling . injured female @entity4 driver 's family touched by support " i 'll tell you what , hopefully all the fans can all sit in the stands on the weekend and think that i can have a podium or something like that and it might happen . " but seriously you have to treat it like it 's any other race when you 're on the track . " two days after this he went out and broke his ankle in practice . come race day he started at the back of the grid -- with said broken ankle -- and stormed through the field to finish an incredible sixth , overtaking @entity124 's former world champion @entity123 on the last lap. so what of the modern @entity4 drivers ? it does n't make for great reading if you 're @entity20 / @entity19 / @entity21 and hoping for a win this weekend in front of the 100,000 - strong crowd . @entity135 -- 0 @entity134 @entity65 wins . @entity136 -- 0 @entity138 @entity65 wins . @entity20 -- 0 @entity33 @entity65 wins . @entity139 -- one @entity33 @entity65 win . @entity141 -- one @entity143 @entity65 win ( and one win in the @entity145 in @entity146 this year , which took him to the top of the championship standings ) . the only man to have serious success on home soil is @entity152 with four @entity134 @entity65 wins , behind only compatriot @entity153 -- who won it six times between 1926 - 39 . but seven - time world champion @entity152 has won a record 91 grands prix and it 's no surprise the 43 - year - old managed four of those at @entity158 , plus five victories when the @entity145 was held at the nurburgring . however , he has finished ninth and eighth at the @entity134 gp since returning from retirement with @entity163 . this weekend most people 's money is on @entity135 . before his @entity166 gave way in the last race , he was streets ahead in @entity146 . no way anyone was going to catch him . @entity141 may have won fantastically in front of his home crowd , but he was cautious afterwards .

" @entity12 " does n't have to imagine this life . he 's too busy living it . the recent high school graduate is one of about 82,000 dreamers who opted to roll the dice on a new government program that promises temporary relief for young illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity5 as children , have no criminal record and are pursuing higher education . they 're called @entity24 because they might have qualified for legal status under the @entity24 if the bill had n't died in the @entity28 in december 2010 when 36 @entity29 and 5 @entity30 voted against cloture . @entity12 agreed to talk to me , but only if i agreed not to reveal his name or give out too much personal information about him or his parents . opinion : ' illegal immigrant ' is the uncomfortable truth ah yes , the parents . if there 's an illegal immigrant who was brought here by his parents , there is a good chance that his parents are undocumented as well . and here the government -- the same agency that carries out deportations , @entity48 -- is asking you to hand over your personal information , including your address , where agents might find you and your parents and haul you all away . @entity12 graduated from high school with honors a few months ago , and now he 's in a state of suspended animation . he ca n't enroll in college , because he ca n't afford the cost of out - of - state tuition . unlike many of his friends , he does n't have a job . but it is n't because he does n't want to work . the problem is that he does n't have a social security number or a driver 's license . he 's stuck . he ca n't go forward , and he ca n't go backward . @entity12 's parents brought him to the @entity5 from @entity69 as a child . this is where he was raised , and he ca n't imagine living anywhere else . " this is the only country i 've known all my life , " he told me . he dreams of getting a driver 's license , getting a job , going to college , attending medical school , perhaps one day becoming a doctor . but , all his plans are written in sand . in @entity12 's life , nothing is certain . nothing , that is , but the two or three page application he filled out to apply for @entity89 . it was , for him , an easy decision . he had waited a long time for a chance like this . and he quickly seized the opportunity . that was probably a smart thing to do . deferments could be granted on a first - come , first - served basis . he is supposed to receive a response in the mail in the next few weeks . radio : undocumented students in their own words the @entity89 program , in the universe of immigration enforcement , falls somewhere between a leap of faith and a crapshoot . if granted temporary relief , applicants can apply for a two - year work visa . there 's no direct path to permanent legal status or @entity5 citizenship , and the deferment can be revoked at any time . meanwhile , the federal government -- which previously did n't know you existed , and you liked it that way -- has opened a file , taken your fingerprints and collected all your information . it 's not a very good deal . but , for undocumented youth , it 's the only deal on the table . so far , there are few takers . the 82,000 who have submitted applications are just 7 % of the estimated 1.2 million people who are eligible for the relief . to qualify , an applicant has to meet certain criteria : be under the age of 31 , brought to the @entity5 before the age of 16 , have lived continuously in the @entity5 since june 15 , 2007 ; no criminal record , in school or graduated high school , or a military veteran . according to immigration lawyers i 've spoken to , who have been fielding calls from dreamers who have lots of questions , some would - be applicants worry that @entity149 could win the election ; the @entity29 will not say whether he would sustain the deferment . all he has said is that we need a permanent solution and that he would replace the program with a better one . in june , @entity149 told a gathering of the @entity157 that he would " put in place my own long - term solution that will replace and supersede the president 's temporary measure . " what does that mean ? no one knows . but , according to the lawyers , other would - be applicants are just as worried about the possibility of an @entity170 victory . which @entity170 will show up in his second term : the one who proposed the solution , or the one whose excessive deportation policies created the problem ? during a recent forum sponsored by @entity178 , the @entity180 - language television network , @entity170 said he announced the new policy because , as he met with young people from around the country , he concluded that it was n't " fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation . " that 's a nice sentiment , mr. president . but guess what . you 're the one who created the cloud by deporting a record 1.4 million people in about four years . that is what happens when a bureaucracy goes overboard . it is a record to be ashamed of . so , if @entity170 is re-elected , do things get better for the undocumented or worse ? no one knows . meanwhile , @entity12 is aware of the risk . what really drove it home , he said , was when his mother , who is also undocumented , had to take him to the local @entity48 office to fill out the application . he worried something might happen to her , that someone might question her , that she might give the wrong answer . what about him ? was n't he worried about putting himself in jeopardy ? here he is walking into the jaws of the beast , so to speak , right into the office of the very agency that is breaking all deportation records under this president . was n't he afraid that he was making a mistake ? " there 's always that thought in the back of your mind , " he said . " because you 're giving over all this information to these people who have total control over whether you get to stay here or not . it was a little nerve - racking , but we got through it . and now we 're just waiting and hoping for the best .

" the singer 's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban @entity4 the @entity8 constitution does not allow for political parties to be banned , however , and the party 's arrested lawmakers will retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime . @entity4 holds 18 of @entity63 's 300 seats . it is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974 , following a seven - year junta , that a party leader and members of parliament have been arrested . deputy prime minister @entity71 , whose socialist @entity73 party is part of the governing coalition , said last week that @entity4 " must be dealt with as a criminal organization . " in 2012 , the party rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some @entity8 over internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country 's deep financial crisis , winning 7 % of the vote and gaining seats in parliament for the first time . recent polls had seen support rise as high as 12 % . however , since @entity34 ' killing last week , opinion polls suggest that @entity4 's popularity has dropped . a poll carried out from september 19 to 21 by @entity92 , for the @entity94 newspaper , indicated that support for @entity4 had fallen to 5.8 % , down from 8.3 % on september 15 . back in 2009 , before the financial crisis and ensuing austerity measures hit @entity8 hard , the party polled only 0.3 % .	@entity17:Nikos Mihos	@entity16:Ioannis Lagos	@entity1:CNN	@entity0:Athens	@entity26:Pavlos Fyssas	@entity12:Nikos Michaloliakos	@entity4:Golden Dawn	@entity48:Kassidiaris	@entity8:Greeks	@entity15:Elias Panagiotaros	@entity63:Parliament	@entity100:NEW	@entity14:Kassidiaris	@entity94:Eleftheros Typos	@entity71:Evangelos Venizelos	@entity92:Rass	@entity73:Pasok	@entity34:Fyssas

" it 's a history of relationship for almost 20 years , and ( a ) very friendly relationship ... and also a relationship which will continue for at least 20 years more , because the projects we are now implementing jointly with @entity7 are aimed at the future .

nearly all the @entity12 primary rivals are now lining up behind @placeholder	@entity13	( @entity0 ) -- as the saying goes about political parties and their candidates : @entity4 fall in love and republicans fall in line . and that 's exactly what republicans are doing , or trying to do . but after this combative primary season , watching @entity13 's former @entity12 rivals struggle with ways to endorse their onetime nemesis is painful . it 's like they 're trying to find ways to snuggle with @entity20 . at the very least , the contortions are a tad awkward and unseemly . and in the real world ( as opposed to the political world ) , the result is completely unbelievable . it 's also a perfect example of why voters do n't trust politicians . consider this : @entity29 finally announced his support of @entity13 this week . yet in his obvious struggle to find the right words to embrace a man he once called a liar , @entity31 came up with this tortured equation : " i am asked sometimes is @entity13 conservative enough ? and my answer is simple — compared to @entity39 ? this is not a choice between @entity13 and @entity42 . this is a choice between @entity13 and the most radical leftist president in @entity46 history . " not exactly effusive , but certainly supportive , at least compared to these @entity31 words about @entity13 last winter : " why should we expect him to level about anything if he is president ? " or the time he called @entity13 " the most anti-immigrant candidate . " or , at a @entity0 debate , when he helpfully pointed out that " i do n't know of any president who has had a @entity55 bank account . " well , never mind . ditto for @entity58 . granted , she dropped out in january and waited a long time to endorse -- until @entity13 was the last man standing . and she had him standing right beside her as she finally gave the nod , describing @entity13 as " the last chance we have to keep @entity46 ... from going over the cliff . " but wait . is that really what @entity58 believes ? as @entity68 's @entity67 points out , @entity58 told him before the @entity70 caucuses that " he ( @entity13 ) can not beat @entity39 . it 's not going to happen . " the reason : @entity13 's @entity75 health care plan , which she called " the blueprint for @entity78 . " that 's exactly what @entity80 had been saying throughout the campaign . he 's meeting with @entity13 friday , but cautions against expectations of an endorsement . it will come , but probably not until @entity80 extracts some policy concessions , such as a promise that @entity13 will never support health care mandates , according to one @entity80 source . and it will be hard for @entity80 to cozy up to the man whom he said would " give the issue of health care away in this election . it is too foundational for us to win the election . " of course , this is not the first time the vanquished have endorsed their previous opponents . ( see : @entity102 and @entity39 . also see : @entity103 endorsing @entity13 circa 2012 . ) but this primary was so divisive — and so personal — the endorsements seem that much more hollow . there 's a very good reason : they are . conservatives still have a hard time believing @entity13 can beat president @entity39 . they may be wrong , but it 's what they really believe even if many of them wo n't say it anymore . and one more thing : now that all these @entity12 are getting in line to endorse @entity13 , it only serves as a reminder that they did n't endorse him before he had become the presumptive nominee . i mean , what was @entity125 waiting for ? come to think of it , maybe distance . after all , @entity46 's mayor took to @entity46 's airwaves to declare that @entity31 was " the most electable @entity12 " in december . that was when he also told @entity132 , referring to @entity13 , that " i 've never seen a guy ... change his position on so many things so fast , on a dime . " in the same interview , @entity125 asked a rhetorical question about how president @entity39 might handle @entity13 . his prediction : @entity39 would say " this is a man without a core ... i think that is a great vulnerability . " as it turns out , there 's plenty of that to go around . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .	@entity20:Darth Vader	@entity29:Newt Gingrich	@entity80:Santorum	@entity150:Borger	@entity132:MSNBC	@entity0:CNN	@entity4:Democrats	@entity78:Obamacare	@entity55:Swiss	@entity75:Massachusetts	@entity58:Bachmann	@entity70:Iowa	@entity31:Gingrich	@entity13:Romney	@entity12:GOP	@entity39:Obama	@entity102:Hillary Clinton	@entity103:John McCain	@entity125:Giuliani	@entity68:ABC	@entity46:America	@entity42:Ronald Reagan	@entity67:Jonathan Karl
