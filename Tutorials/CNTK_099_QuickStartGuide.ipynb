    "Welcome to CNTK and the wonders of deep learning! This tutorial will give a brief overview of CNTK. It is meant for users that are new to CNTK but have some experience with deep neural networks.\n",
    "The focus will be on how the basic steps of deep learning are done in CNTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a deep model, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * define your model structure\n",
    " * prepare your data\n",
    " * train it\n",
    " * evaluate its accuracy\n",
    " * deploy it\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured along these five steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this tutorial, you will need CNTK 2.0 and ideally a CUDA-capable GPU (deep learning is no fun without GPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Your Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us dive right in. Below we will introduce CNTK's programming model--*networks are function objects* and CNTK's data model. We will put that into action for logistic regression and MNIST digit recognition,\n",
    "using CNTK's Functional API.\n",
    "Lastly, we will replicate one example using CNTK's lower-level, TensorFlow/Theano-like graph API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming Model: Networks are Function Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK, a neural network is a function object.\n",
    "On one hand, a neural network in CNTK is just a function that you can call\n",
    "to apply it to data.\n",
    "On the other hand, a neural network contains learnable parameters\n",
    "that can be accessed like object members.\n",
    "Complicated function objects can be composed as hierarchies of simpler ones, which,\n",
    "for example, represent layers.\n",
    "The function-object approach is similar to Keras, Chainer, Dynet, Pytorch,\n",
    "and the recent Sonnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following illustrates the function-object approach with pseudo-code, using the example\n",
    "of a fully-connected layer (called `Dense` in CNTK)::\n"

    "Note that the real CNTK function objects are not actual Python lambdas.\n",
    "Rather, they are static graphs in C++,\n",
    "wrapped in the Python class `Function` that exposes `__call__()` and `__getattr__()` methods.\n",
    "However, CNTK allows to define networks as Python expressions and functions,\n",
    "as long as they can be converted into static graphs of type `Function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function object is CNTK's single abstraction used to represent different levels of neural networks, which\n",
    "are only distinguished by convention:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **basic operations** without learnable parameters (e.g. `times()`, `__add__()`, `sigmoid()`...)\n",
    " * **layers** (`Dense()`, `Embedding()`, `Convolution()`...). Layers map one input to one output.\n",
    " * **recurrent step functions** (`LSTM()`, `GRU()`, `RNNStep()`). Step functions map a previous state and a new input to a new state.\n",
    " * **loss and metric** functions (`cross_entropy_with_softmax()`, `binary_cross_entropy()`, `squared_error()`, `classification_error()`...).\n",
    "   In CNTK, losses and metric are not special, just functions.\n",
    " * **models**. Models are defined by the user and map features to predictions or scores, and is what gets deployed in the end.\n",
    " * **criterion function**. The criterion function maps (features, labels) to (loss, metric).\n",
    "   The Trainer optimizes the loss by SGD, and logs the metric, which may be non-differentiable.\n",

    " * **stacking** (`Sequential()`, `For()`)\n",

    "Expressions can be written as multi-line functions through decorator syntax (`@Function`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, function objects enable parameter sharing. If you call the same\n",
    "function object at multiple places, all invocations will naturally share the same learnable parameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "### CNTK's Data model: Sequences of Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK can operate on two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **tensors** (that is, N-dimensional arrays), dense or sparse\n",
    " * **sequences** of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction is that the shape of a tensor is static during operation,\n",
    "while the length of a sequence depends on data.\n",
    "Tensors have *static axes*, while a sequence has a *dynamic axis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK, categorical data is represented as sparse one-hot tensors, not as integer vectors.\n",
    "This allows to write embeddings and loss functions in a unified fashion as matrix products.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK adopts Python's type-annotation syntax to declare CNTK types.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    " * `Tensor[(13,42)]` denotes a tensor with 13 rows and 42 columns, and\n",
    " * `Sequence[SparseTensor[300000]]` a sequence of sparse vectors, which for example could represent a word out of a 300k dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unlike Python type hints, this works with Python 2.7. There are two more data types: 'batch of tensors' and 'batch of sequences of tensors'.\n",
    "These are used internally for minibatching, but we generally try to hide batching from the user:\n",
    "We want users to think in tensors and sequences, and leave mini-batching to CNTK.\n",
    "To this end, unlike other toolkits, CNTK transparently batches *sequences with different lengths*\n",
    "into the same minibatch, and handles all the necessary padding and packing.\n",
    "Workarounds like 'bucketing' are not needed.\n",

Typically, one would start with random initialization of the model parameters.

However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to load a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",

    "Now that we have trained the network. Let us evaluate the trained network on data that hasn't been used for training. This is called **testing**. Let us create some new data and evaluate the average error and loss on this set. This is done using `trainer.test_minibatch`. Note the error on this previously unseen data is comparable to training error. This is a **key** check. Should the error be larger than the training error by a large margin, it indicates that the trained model will not perform well on data that it has not seen during training. This is known as [overfitting][]. There are several ways to address overfitting that is beyond the scope of this tutorial but the Cognitive Toolkit provides the necessary components to address overfitting.\n",

    "Note: We are testing on a single minibatch for illustrative purposes. In practice one runs several minibatches of test data and reports the average. \n",
