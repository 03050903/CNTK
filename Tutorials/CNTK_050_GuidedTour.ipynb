    "\n",
    "Welcome to CNTK and the wonders of deep learning! Deep neural networks are redefining how computer programs\n",

    "With CNTK, you can be part of this revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK is the prime tool that Microsoft product groups use to create deep models for a whole range of products,\n",
    "from speech recognition and machine translation via various image-classification services\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a guided tour of CNTK. It is primarily meant for users that are new to CNTK but have some experience with deep neural networks.\n",
    "The focus will be on how the basic steps of deep learning are done in CNTK,\n",
    "which we will show predominantly by example.\n",
    "This tour is not a complete API description. Instead, we refer the reader to the documentation\n",
    "and task-specific tutorials for more detailed information.\n",

    "To train a deep model, you will need to define your model structure, prepare your data so that it can be fed to CNTK, train the model and evaluate its accuracy, and deploy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guided tour is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Defining your **model structure**\n",
    "    * The CNTK programming model: Networks as Function Objects\n",
    "    * CNTK's Data Model: Tensors and Sequences of Tensors\n",

    "# Defining Your Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us dive right in. Below we will introduce CNTK's programming model--*networks are function objects* and CNTK's data model. We will put that into action for logistic regression and MNIST digit recognition,\n",

    "### The CNTK Programming Model: Networks are Function Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK, a neural network is a function object.\n",
    "On one hand, a neural network in CNTK is just a function that you can call\n",
    "to apply it to data.\n",
    "On the other hand, a neural network contains learnable parameters\n",
    "that can be accessed like object members.\n",
    "Complicated function objects can be composed as hierarchies of simpler ones, which,\n",
    "for example, represent layers.\n",
    "The function-object approach is similar to Keras, Chainer, Dynet, Pytorch,\n",
    "and the recent Sonnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following illustrates the function-object approach with pseudo-code, using the example\n",
    "of a fully-connected layer (called `Dense` in CNTK)::\n"

    "Again, this is only pseudo-code. In reality, CNTK function objects are not actual Python lambdas.\n",
    "Rather, they are represented internally as graph structures in C++ that encode the formula,\n",
    "similar to TensorFlow and Theano.\n",
    "This graph structure is wrapped in the Python class `Function` that exposes `__call__()` and `__getattr__()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function object is CNTK's single abstraction used to represent different levels of neural networks, which\n",
    "are only distinguished by convention:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **basic operations** without learnable parameters (e.g. `times()`, `__add__()`, `sigmoid()`...)\n",
    " * **layers** (`Dense()`, `Embedding()`, `Convolution()`...). Layers map one input to one output.\n",
    " * **recurrent step functions** (`LSTM()`, `GRU()`, `RNNStep()`). Step functions map a previous state and a new input to a new state.\n",
    " * **loss and metric** functions (`cross_entropy_with_softmax()`, `binary_cross_entropy()`, `squared_error()`, `classification_error()`...).\n",
    "   In CNTK, losses and metric are not special, just functions.\n",
    " * **models**. Models are defined by the user and map features to predictions or scores, and is what gets deployed in the end.\n",
    " * **criterion function**. The criterion function maps (features, labels) to (loss, metric).\n",
    "   The Trainer optimizes the loss by SGD, and logs the metric, which may be non-differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order layers compose objects into more complex ones, including:\n",
    "\n",
    " * layer **stacking** (`Sequential()`, `For()`)\n",
    " * **recurrence** (`Recurrence()`, `Fold()`, `UnfoldFrom()`, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks are commonly defined by using existing CNTK functions (such as\n",
    "specific types of neural-network layers)\n",
    "and composing them using `Sequential()`.\n",
    "In addition, users can write their own functions\n",
    "as arbitrary Python expressions, as long as those consist of CNTK operations\n",
    "over CNTK data types.\n",
    "Python expressions get converted into the internal representation by wrapping them in a call to\n",
    "`Function()`. This is similar to Keras' `Lambda()`.\n",
    "Expressions can be written as multi-line functions through decorator syntax (`@Function`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, function objects enable parameter sharing. If you call the same\n",
    "function object at multiple places, all invocations will naturally share the same learnable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the function object is CNTK's single abstraction for conveniently defining\n",
    "simple and complex models, parameter sharing, and training objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that it is possible to define CNTK networks directly in terms of\n",
    "its underlying graph representation similar to TensorFlow and Theano. This is discussed\n",

    "\n",
    "### CNTK's Data model: Sequences of Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK can operate on two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **tensors** (that is, N-dimensional arrays), dense or sparse\n",
    " * **sequences** of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction is that the shape of a tensor is static during operation,\n",
    "while the length of a sequence depends on data.\n",
    "Tensors have *static axes*, while a sequence has an additional *dynamic axis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK, categorical data is represented as sparse one-hot tensors, not as integer vectors.\n",
    "This allows to write embeddings and loss functions in a unified fashion as matrix products.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK adopts Python's type-annotation syntax to declare CNTK types (works with Python 2.7).\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    " * `Tensor[(13,42)]` denotes a tensor with 13 rows and 42 columns, and\n",
    " * `Sequence[SparseTensor[300000]]` a sequence of sparse vectors, which for example could represent a word out of a 300k dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the absence of a batch dimension. CNTK hides batching from the user.\n",
    "We want users to think in tensors and sequences, and leave mini-batching to CNTK.\n",
    "Unlike other toolkits, CNTK can also automatically batch *sequences with different lengths*\n",
    "into one minibatch, and handles all necessary padding and packing.\n",

    "# Feeding Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided your model structure and defined it, you are facing the question on feeding\n",
    "your training data to the CNTK training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples simply feed the data as numpy/scipy arrays.\n",
    "That is only one of three ways CNTK provides for feeding data to the trainer:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. As **numpy/scipy arrays**, for small data sets that can just be loaded into RAM.\n",
    " 2. Through instances of **CNTK's MinibatchSource class**, for large data sets that do not fit into RAM.\n",
    " 3. Through an **explicit minibatch-loop** when the above do not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feeding Data Via Numpy/Scipy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train()` and `test()` functions accept a tuple of numpy or scipy arrays for their `minibatch_source` arguments.\n",
    "The tuple members must be in the same order as the arguments of the `criterion` function that `train()` or `test()` are called on.\n",
    "For dense tensors, use numpy arrays, while sparse data should have the type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the arguments should be a Python list of numpy/scipy arrays, where each list entry represents a data item. For arguments declared as `Sequence[...]`, the first axis of the numpy/scipy array is the sequence length, while the remaining axes are the shape of each token of the sequence. Arguments that are not sequences consist of a single tensor. The shapes, data types (`np.float32/float64`) and sparseness must match the argument types as declared in the criterion function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optimization, arguments that are not sequences can also be passed as a single large numpy/scipy array (instead of a list). This is what is done in the examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is the responsibility of the user to randomize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feeding Data Using the `MinibatchSource` class for Reading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Production-scale training data sometimes does not fit into RAM. For example, a typical speech corpus may be several hundred GB large. For this case, CNTK provides the `MinibatchSource` class, which provides:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A **chunked randomization algorithm** that holds only part of the data in RAM at any given time.\n",
    " * **Distributed reading** where each worker reads a different subset.\n",
    " * A **transformation pipeline** for images and image augmentation.\n",
    " * **Composability** across multiple data types (e.g. image captioning).\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the `MinibatchSource` class implements a limited set of data types in the form of \"deserializers\":\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Images** (`ImageDeserializer`).\n",
    " * **Speech files** (`HTKFeatureDeserializer`, `HTKMLFDeserializer`).\n",
    " * Data in CNTK's **canonical text format (CTF)**, which encodes any of CNTK's data types in a human-readable text format.\n",
    "\n",

    " * **BlockMomentum**.\n",
    "\n",

    "**1-bit SGD** uses 1-bit data compression with residual feedback to speed up data-parallel training\n",
    "by reducing the data exchanges to 1 bit per gradient value.\n",
    "To avoid affecting convergence, each worker keeps a quantization-error residual which is added to the next minibatch's\n",
    "gradient. This way, all gradient values are eventually transmitted with full accuracy, albeit at a delay.\n",
    "This method has been found effective for networks where communication cost becomes the dominating factor,\n",
    "such as full-connected networks and some recurrent ones.\n",
    "This method has been found to only minimally degrade accuracy at good speed-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BlockMomentum** improves communication bandwidth by exchanging gradients only every N minibatches.\n",
    "To avoid affecting convergence, BlockMomentum combines \"model averaging\" with the residual technique of 1-bit SGD:\n",
    "After N minibatches, block gradients are aggregated across workers, and added to all model copies at weight of 1/N,\n",

    "through CNTK's data-reading infrastructure (`MinibatchSource`), and spoon-feeding through a custom minibatch loop.\n",
    "We then took a look at CNTK's advanced training options, including distributed training, logging to TensorBoard, checkpointing, CV-based training control, and final model evaluation.\n",
