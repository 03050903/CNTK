    " * Defining your **model structure**\n",
    "    * The CNTK programming model: Networks as Function Objects\n",
    "    * CNTK's Data Model: Tensors and Sequences of Tensors\n",

    "In CNTK, a neural network is a function object.\n",
    "On one hand, a neural network in CNTK is just a function that you can call\n",
    "to apply it to data.\n",
    "On the other hand, a neural network contains learnable parameters\n",

    "Complicated function objects can be composed as hierarchies of simpler ones, which,\n",
    "for example, represent layers.\n",
    "The function-object approach is similar to Keras, Chainer, Dynet, Pytorch,\n",
    "and the recent Sonnet.\n",

    "Note that the real CNTK function objects are not actual Python lambdas.\n",
    "Rather, they are static graphs in C++,\n",
    "wrapped in the Python class `Function` that exposes `__call__()` and `__getattr__()` methods.\n",
    "However, CNTK allows to define networks as Python expressions and functions,\n",
    "as long as they can be converted into static graphs of type `Function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function object is CNTK's single abstraction used to represent different levels of neural networks, which\n",
    "are only distinguished by convention:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **basic operations** without learnable parameters (e.g. `times()`, `__add__()`, `sigmoid()`...)\n",
    " * **layers** (`Dense()`, `Embedding()`, `Convolution()`...). Layers map one input to one output.\n",
    " * **recurrent step functions** (`LSTM()`, `GRU()`, `RNNStep()`). Step functions map a previous state and a new input to a new state.\n",
    " * **loss and metric** functions (`cross_entropy_with_softmax()`, `binary_cross_entropy()`, `squared_error()`, `classification_error()`...).\n",
    "   In CNTK, losses and metric are not special, just functions.\n",
    " * **models**. Models are defined by the user and map features to predictions or scores, and is what gets deployed in the end.\n",

    "This is similar to Keras' `Lambda()`.\n",
    "Expressions can be written as multi-line functions through decorator syntax (`@Function`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, function objects enable parameter sharing. If you call the same\n",
    "function object at multiple places, all invocations will naturally share the same learnable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the function object is CNTK's single abstraction for conveniently defining\n",

    "\n",
    "(Note that under the hood, CNTK uses a static graph,\n",

    "### CNTK's Data model: Sequences of Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK can operate on two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **tensors** (that is, N-dimensional arrays), dense or sparse\n",
    " * **sequences** of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction is that the shape of a tensor is static during operation,\n",
    "while the length of a sequence depends on data.\n",
    "Tensors have *static axes*, while a sequence has a *dynamic axis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK, categorical data is represented as sparse one-hot tensors, not as integer vectors.\n",
    "This allows to write embeddings and loss functions in a unified fashion as matrix products.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNTK adopts Python's type-annotation syntax to declare CNTK types.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    " * `Tensor[(13,42)]` denotes a tensor with 13 rows and 42 columns, and\n",
    " * `Sequence[SparseTensor[300000]]` a sequence of sparse vectors, which for example could represent a word out of a 300k dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unlike Python type hints, this works with Python 2.7. There are two more data types: 'batch of tensors' and 'batch of sequences of tensors'.\n",
    "These are used internally for minibatching, but we generally try to hide batching from the user:\n",
    "We want users to think in tensors and sequences, and leave mini-batching to CNTK.\n",
    "To this end, unlike other toolkits, CNTK transparently batches *sequences with different lengths*\n",
    "into the same minibatch, and handles all the necessary padding and packing.\n",
    "Workarounds like 'bucketing' are not needed.\n",

    "# Feeding Your Data\n",

    "\n",
    "The above examples simply feed the data as numpy/scipy arrays.\n",
    "That is only one of three ways CNTK provides for feeding data to the trainer:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. As **numpy/scipy arrays**, for small data sets that can just be loaded into RAM.\n",
    " 2. Through instances of **CNTK's MinibatchSource class**, for large data sets that do not fit into RAM.\n",
    " 3. Through an **explicit minibatch-loop** when the above do not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feeding Data Via Numpy/Scipy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train()` and `test()` functions accept a tuple of numpy or scipy arrays for their `minibatch_source` arguments.\n",
    "The tuple members must be in the same order as the arguments of the `criterion` function that `train()` or `test()` are called on.\n",
    "For dense tensors, use numpy arrays, while sparse data should have the type `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the arguments should be a Python list of numpy/scipy arrays, where each list entry represents a data item. For arguments declared as `Sequence[...]`, the first axis of the numpy/scipy array is the sequence length, while the remaining axes are the shape of each token of the sequence. Arguments that are not sequences consist of a single tensor. The shapes, data types (`np.float32/float64`) and sparseness must match the argument types as declared in the criterion function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optimization, arguments that are not sequences can also be passed as a single large numpy/scipy array (instead of a list). This is what is done in the examples above.\n",

    " * A **chunked randomization algorithm** that holds only part of the data in RAM at any given time.\n",
    " * **Distributed reading** where each worker reads a different subset.\n",

    "This is often sufficient for convolutional networks, which have a high computation/communication ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1-bit SGD** uses 1-bit data compression with residual feedback to speed up data-parallel training\n",
    "by reducing the data exchanges to 1 bit per gradient value.\n",
    "To avoid affecting convergence, each worker keeps a quantization-error residual which is added to the next minibatch's\n",
    "gradient. This way, all gradient values are eventually transmitted with full accuracy, albeit at a delay.\n",
    "This method has been found effective for networks where communication cost becomes the dominating factor,\n",
    "such as full-connected networks and some recurrent ones.\n",
    "This method has been found to only minimally degrade accuracy at good speed-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BlockMomentum** improves communication bandwidth by exchanging gradients only every N minibatches.\n",
    "To avoid affecting convergence, BlockMomentum combines \"model averaging\" with the residual technique of 1-bit SGD:\n",
    "After N minibatches, block gradients are aggregated across workers, and added to all model copies at weight of 1/N,\n",
