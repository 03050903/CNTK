    "# Sampled Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification and prediction problems a typical criterion function is cross-entropy with softmax. If the number of output classes is high the computation of this criterion and the corresponding gradients could be quite costly. Sampled Softmax is a heuristic to speed up training in these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function is used in neural networks if we want to interpret the network output as a probability distribution over a set of classes $C$ with $|C|=N_C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax maps an $N_C$-dimensional vector $z$, which has unrestricted values, to an $N_C$ dimensional vector $p$ whith non-negative values that sum up to 1 so that they can be interpreted as probabilities. More precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_i &= softmax(z, i)\\\\\n",
    "    &= \\frac{exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{k\\in C} exp(z_k)}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows we assume that the input $z$ to the softmax is computed from some hidden vector $h$ of dimension $N_h$  in a specific way, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = W h + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is a learnable weight matrix of dimension $(N_c, N_h)$ and is $b$ a learnable bias vector.\n",
    "We restrict ourself to this specific choice of $z$ because it helps in implementing an efficient sampled softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical use-case like for example a recurrent language model, the hidden vector $h$ would be the output of the recurrent layers and $C$ would be the set of words to predict.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As a training criterion, we use cross-entropy which is a function of the expected (true) class $t\\in C$ and the probability predicted for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cross\\_entropy := -log(p_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampled Softmax from the outside\n",
    "\n",
    "For the normal softmax the CNTK Python-api provides the function [cross_entropy_with_softmax](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.ops.html?highlight=softmax#cntk.ops.cross_entropy_with_softmax). This takes as input the vector $N_C$-dimensional vector $z$. As mentioned for our sampled softmax implementation we assume that this z is computed by $ z = W h + b $. In sampled softmax this has to be part of the whole implementation of the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the code for `cross_entropy_with_sampled_softmax_and_embedding`. Letâ€™s look at signature first.\n",
    "\n",
    "One fundamental difference to the corresponding function in the Python-api (`cross_entropy_with_softmax`) is that in the Python api function the input corresponds to $z$ and must have the same dimension as the target vector, while in cross_entropy_with_full_softmax the input corresponds to our hidden vector $h$ can have any dimension (hidden_dim).\n",
    "Actually, hidden_dim will be typically much lower than the dimension of the target vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have some additional parameter `num_samples, sampling_weights, allow_duplicates` that control the random sampling. \n",
    "Another difference to the api function is that we return a tripple (z, cross_entropy_on_samples, error_on_samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to the details of the implementation below.\n"
